<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, where it is now dug for the underground tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows this, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called "uranges," were incorporated into the large picture postcard for towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the data of the Bavarian Measurement Office between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic capture of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Measurement Management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original composition paper for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered plots from the so-called "urine collection" from which the Property Tax has been derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no farmers there today - but small farmers of the plant" "" "Land in the Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the location of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the pamphlet, in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked up people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Munich District Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüften" was created there in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was head of the institution - a psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the banquet of so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he was forbidden to use force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the first place there was room for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the county seat in Hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost is one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt young people meet at the Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "" "Main Square" "", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombed many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a chapel of mine from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where this day the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 will be the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn racetrack.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen's right group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racial attacks from the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Group for the state of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-american travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable racial-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and be noted here," says the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints as well as the state's law enforcement authorities that disproportionately aim for minorities, prompted the group to release the warning message, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints about such a frequency we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and associates about what could happen in Missouri," "" "Chapel said." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring along chewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported in 2015 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which classify the state with respect to the number of such violations at the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws, obliging local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to migratory violations, which will contribute to further racism in view of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weiffaun project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies in the Schwendemann family court yard.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which it farms 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many juveniles supplied and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest Milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales come to the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also chairman of the fisherman, he described the fence project as" "" "fundamental importance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space ensures a lot of work, a lot of things have to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and the topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers should be supported at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">By 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The maintenance area is 40 hectares, which must not be enforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half was funded by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß asserted that" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Support Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to disclose the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor setting marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be enclosed must not be towing (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The decision of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently running for the Fischbacher Weiffune Project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The total cost of disclosure is 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump receives the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans like this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the company's place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty Imiteers would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took on its importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he himself formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weathers, your poor, and your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely, the wretched waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had accomplished a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus had changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilantes.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to confuse it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, who brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty progresses.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often awful journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not intended to illuminate the way, but ignite the hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish Members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK's team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship cadres will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several Scottish athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butt, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team for team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at her fifth world championships, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scotsmen are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir runs along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season, which included victory for the British Team Trials and Anniversary games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the Captain's Captain says it" "" "enormously proud" "" "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be mixed with medals and finals." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"what makes team captain so special is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team mates tuned for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scotsmen who belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to Podium.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back in the Olympiastadion again.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block Critics over Facebook: don't throw yourself around a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He blushed at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union lodged it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a firm hand in guiding his state and adhering to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means of combining with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore blocking people coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum called official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who wave the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only genuine people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," "" "she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective assignment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the Governor's staff referred to as a "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "interrogation."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook Era simply makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when people have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical corpses or to arrest or silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County missed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck him.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, prevailed, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="271">The world's largest and most profitable goldmine, Grasberg, in the possession of Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.</seg>
<seg id="272">In 2015 alone, Freeport was mined worth $3.1 billion in gold and copper.</seg>
<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wood resources valued at estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="274">These wealth, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military keeps a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="276">Papua's demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goans and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="278">Mass killings in Papuas's tribal highlands in the 1970 "s became genocide in accordance with the UN Human Rights Commission.</seg>

<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of "securing the national sovereignty."</seg>

<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10.000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabre.</seg>

<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA director Pruitt is retiring due to the reluctance of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the environmental protection authority, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smoke-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change, when his agency turned out to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities more responsibly than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit which was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">The deadline is 1 October for States to meet the standards set by Ozone in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of harsh environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed to blocking or delaying regulation, which opposed the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback on the Prugraph regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Appeals Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPO to co-operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under earlier administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for performance and then waited to be accused by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who complained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">However, the EPO's opinion said that at some point, Pruitt will use its "power to delay and all other legally available power-making" to ensure that the regulations "are based on a solid policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader new version of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA this week, said that the group wanted to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"reversal of the EPA - according to our lawsuits - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog who flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, a Serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini points out: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer urn book: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document, on the Mount of Tumour, apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So people also lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As originated from the description of Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the local image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" is the third, the community centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating from the period around the year 1600 prevailed these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath the church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Connected with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greatest of the two was christened at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the window panes were hammered and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing-schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today remained a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"" "today Horst Kallenbach and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the" "" "sheep retirees" "" "as successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant." ""</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers, the friends and promoters of Tumlingens invite on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "Hartmut Romann" "" "Vorsteher Hartmut Romann" "" "speaks the closing word." ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the Serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over pastures to the forest," the organisers bring out the fantastic views.</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tumors and hearing-schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to their home care, such as the Serenade organiser Walter Martini.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim does not defend itself" "" "does not envisage a legal precondition for the construction and has therefore turned to the counsellor." ""</seg>

<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at all, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone results in the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the urban area.</seg>
<seg id="510">These zones are intended to prevent a "savings" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by a change in the land protection plan - but the district government Düsseldorf had not approved the city of Viersen due to a formation fault.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the approval of approval granted is unlawful and therefore also rejected," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim." ""</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a new subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the town Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare terrain.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - roughly one-fifth of the current demand for all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, the city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="533">The commercial association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to lure the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the president of the commercial association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend will make the customers more aware of what offers their own city off the usual supermarket product.</seg>
<seg id="535">Therefore, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeship places.</seg>

<seg id="540">City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>

<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals lost sight of the city center while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to enliven the city center - to landlords, businesses of the entire city and associations.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that had spread to some extent, had said König in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that Germany's third "home shopping" day, for the first time, takes part in five Thuringian cities for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="550">In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>

<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in a stone belt at the furniture exchange, once a week I will help here in Greven in the Furniture Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at the school for an open full day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What is your experience with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>

<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the municipal council prefer not to foresee such a common space as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniorean living, but open to the church.</seg>

<seg id="758">The establishment of a community space would be, according to Tjades, supported by 60 percent of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposed resolution looks to signal the investor to indicate that in this respect it is not intended to throw a billboard between the legs, the finding that both semitrailers - which is based on the surrounding environment - as well as pent roof - would be possible to reduce the height of the seat and make the construction more economical.</seg>

<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be added to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">Therefore, a good mobile network reception will play a role in the selection of the location.</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">Later the Starway Ticket will be extended by train.</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the Starway, the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the club explained.</seg>
<seg id="810">In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why one star more light than another, although it was far more distant.</seg>
<seg id="811">It also conveys in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best seen.</seg>
<seg id="812">The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014, the highest situated observatory in northern Germany.</seg>

<seg id="815">Since 2003, at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there is something similar to the planned starlight - the planetary pathway.</seg>
<seg id="816">Starting from Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetary Trail leads up to Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an extra-terrestrial location in Diemarden (community of equals) with the Sedna planet.</seg>

<seg id="819">The entire distance of the planet's path is about four kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="820">While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.</seg>

<seg id="904">Works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">A seven ton concrete part on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach was installed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, foreman at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation-needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building end is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be kept.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, which is covered with a red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure the stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red coloured sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal attachment, which is also used as a mode of operation.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2,20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian route is going to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The particular aspect of this is that it is finished parts, a patent granted by the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special finger tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable where many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed in advance of the work by handouts on the project.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish first had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>

<seg id="932">It is not so common that parties are pulling together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to get under a hat is coming together.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Linke) are part of a broad alliance that displays a peaceful flag this day, as the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the loudly poster of the "Great Campaign of Electoral Campaign."</seg>
<seg id="934">And well-known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gaulland make the leading duo for the Parliamentary elections on September 24, and vice-president Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="935">But those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event don't want to listen to the AfD-voters, but to demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="936">The motto "The Eifel remains colourful."</seg>
<seg id="937">Originally the city picnic under the motto "All at a table" is planned on the fountain square, but now takes place on the parking space below the rear - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.</seg>
<seg id="938">A colourful picture that is offered here.</seg>
<seg id="939">And what Christa Karoli, chair of the Forum A world and one of the authoritative organizers, is really happy: "great how many people came together here."</seg>
<seg id="940">There is music and lots of food, including a "original German potato salad, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him along.</seg>
<seg id="941">The police has ordered a lot of officials to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the railway station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.</seg>
<seg id="942">How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?</seg>
<seg id="943">Mario Homeis reported by the AfD Vulkaneifel, he took care of such an event and got the supplement.</seg>
<seg id="944">The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had asked Daun first, but there was a refusal because of the Laurentiuskirch already constructed there are not enough parking spaces available.</seg>
<seg id="945">"" "so now the Rondelle, Homeis is pleased that" "" "we can have such a beautiful event here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="946">"" "with a view to the event at the Rondellplatz, he says:" "" "this is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="947">This is also true: at about 8pm there is a band for entertainment at the Rondellplatz, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe boy.</seg>
<seg id="948">There are about 200 people in the hall waiting for the leading candidate for the Parliamentary elections, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch to talk about their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is a short time after 9 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can press down - no special incidents.</seg>
<seg id="952">Trombone hits trumpet</seg>
<seg id="953">There is a reunion with the wolfist trombone Frederic Belli in the series Haslacher Klosterconcerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.</seg>
<seg id="954">Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folk" meets classical German training with roots in brass music.</seg>
<seg id="955">Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchestras.</seg>
<seg id="956">Thus Petkov Solotrompeter is the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="957">Both unites the desire not only to transcend boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.</seg>
<seg id="958">For example, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the song "Exchange Suite" of the Jazzechopreisträger Nils Wogram, classicism, jazz and free play become a fascinating total artwork.</seg>
<seg id="959">This piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs won't bother Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been funded without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by Qatar's rich royal family.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must be countered by means of legitimate income sources that allow them to break even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had taken huge debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to clubs debt to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period running until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP for UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for reporting on the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue will be expelled for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of €60 million (back then $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalonian company could sponsor PSG if the sponsorship value was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the sponsorship of the PSA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar World Cup will be ambassador and that such maneuvers could be easy for UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to avoid any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They discussed the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent following signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial Doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1188">By focusing on the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they managed to regain the impossibility of regaining the last part of the wit.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with its adults who now play adults is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the watering principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character rummage through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious coop (Mr. Showholder), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-evil plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showholder), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, excourses are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's lower lip of "Singles," his former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random delusions that could heat this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon meanwhile reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its East-against-West Ring-War Iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy with Rhys Thomas as director gives to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the road of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synced by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game "Find out the voice."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, the comedy is not fast or frequent.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was rebutted to a lesser extent, could better supply his agitprop-satire, as Gregory and Iosef always visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1215">In the case of the same raids in Italy two persons were arrested.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architect and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend over." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">A classic copper-light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area for the mezzanine.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored in order to make it seem longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering work went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is countermatter so that when you push the door, it slips very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will be selling the floor - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the bottom size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they succeeded in enlarging the floor area while simultaneously using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.</seg>

<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>

<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - accounts for about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>

<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property where Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly could actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day of work, he presented a major problem to President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: poor information that got into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by supervising his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was annoyed due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of positions that were to be persuaded," "" "said the former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg opposed to Politico in February." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know what we do not know - that trumps tweets without their interventions have even more combustibles.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him several times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the fondness of advisors to give the president doubtful information for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump-officials say trump as a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he will find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody had ciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GothNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banished from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and has revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the former chief of staff Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary General Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, receives the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014 some 30,000 overnights per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospects in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhostel with managing director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group with the Freudenstadt object has four houses.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Birkenhof we have been building shuttlecovers in front of the entrance for a long time, and when one enters the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were demolished, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.</seg>

<seg id="1469">Scherer explains the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Single vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee received the work over the past few weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "", "referring to people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller had widened and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there are already first charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to be targeted at the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigations focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took a close look at more and more trumps of private and business environments.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accusation of whether the president may have hampered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury will therefore also be called ankle chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of them are switched on when dealing with bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite individuals to act under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations were issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr, Trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign manager Paul Manafort also took part in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension shows that Mueller does not want to intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act fast.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the subject gives the democrats a way to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else about which they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House apprehends any measures which speeded up the work of the special agent in" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that I am not being determined by the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed from that, it was said in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this Rausage, accusations against Trump had become loud, he did not want to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Commenting on a Senate Committee in June, Comey asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the Special Agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress such as the Watergate affair around the late president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the insistence of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and democratic senators submitted draft laws on Thursday, after which the Special Investigator could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>

<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest iron giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the discontinuation of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelkals is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this ice shelf, the balance of waxes and interruptions was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete Schelfest there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C ice shelf is in danger, as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelkals and iceberg does not raise the sea level, as they float on the water and ice as much water as it produces after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Scheleis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural event and we have no direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapses, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, "Our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this giant iceberg to climate change, many ice-pluses of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica covers South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Survey has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to bring house tariff to staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"" "" "" "because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant jobs, the CDU demands to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs in the administration took place.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The doctrinal points in the circle are obviously highly sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were listed for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, there is still a lack of staff to cope with the higher demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Together with the FDP and the UWG, the CDU wants to take the initiative and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the administration aims to develop a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to meet not only short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented evaluation of the applicant's shortages.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, calling for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who are leaving the service suffering from illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time to act, so that there are no more jobs left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Leader of the CDU, goes out with his party even beyond the joint request.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He already had a bad surprise already in the chalk-day, when he publicly questioned the costs of personnel costs and amazed the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "peoples want all possibilities to be checked which enable a withdrawal from the local employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should seek a house tariff," "" "said peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually envisages the tariff bill for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least, by the increasing number of asylum seekers, counsellor Thomas Hendele and director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone of NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "" "said Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Retreat' because their crew had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the extensive allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Retreat', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that his crew will take rubber dinghy migrants onboard, which will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Prosecutor's Act, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian coastguard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring any" "" "essential amendments or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up, the Nobel Prize Winner Organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the bailout measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"" "nine female bikers, the" "" "Berlin outpost" "" "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days." ""</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle at Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Once again, a lookout spot on the lookout spot, connected by "flounge" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days, many altimeters were announced again.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through stadionrush instead of sweating through wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans, and huge tournaments with high garages included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">The first federal ligadas, which are increasingly involved in this area, have also recognised this.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people are going to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year sending the Bundesliga sponsorship to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">During the E-sport, computer games such as "League of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA World Cup are challenged at competitive levels.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long established itself, in which professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in Asia, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capacity.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="1733">The goal is to take the track into operation in December 2020, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees this as a guide for supporting regional but internationally competitive companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">Like Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) tries to produce a Rhineland-Palatinate label in wine to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports that has declined for ten years.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day prior to Audi's announcement, BMW told that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW Chairman said the company believes that "there are smarter options as driving constraints," and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install systems for the neutralization of exhaust gases released by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of violating the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's faults that could regulate the use of so-called off-off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but to drive back under normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Several Volkswagen employees were charged in the United States, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to bypass the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's win.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message: laughter," "" "For there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish Immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he suggested, among other things, as a draftsman for greeting cards - what frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the sixties: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist let himself be inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own specifications, he still sits still at the drawing table, works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plushes and clocks, his drolly figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures.</seg>

<seg id="1792">"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.</seg>
<seg id="1793">The script is not written by him.</seg>
<seg id="1794">That is why he tends to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without any word.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Climate change threatens lavender from Provence</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and on account of the diseases transmitted to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the last few years, which has caused much less rainfall in spring and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits diaphragms, and in very dry weather there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there's a lot at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have underdeveloped smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce weekly convenes in Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponent, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, sensations and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the corpses are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamerie.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special public prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders involved in drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolent and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we're suspicious of everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which was translated with the "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields since rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February, the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, assumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assaulted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drugs problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish shocking investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to keep on living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead men... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce Team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curl like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there always at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask:" "" "was his love for routine his calamity?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and remain alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing lines," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "anger is said by the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing has happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room in which the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones suddenly were allowed. days earlier, it was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen called the governor himself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce looked at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the state expenditures focused on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local by drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption in high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez became a storage room for signs and stickers that protested against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few notes and went to a demonstration in the morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder all over the country by writing down on footpaths and constructions in organised protests "SOS Press."</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez leaves Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is regrouped by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and indifferent society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the panzed herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy crude oil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you blindfold only a little, you could almost believe that it slept," "" "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen." ""</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbieater, although covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed a better mix of its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, even though it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in proponents and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the issue hardly any.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, including the remaining businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the commencement of construction work, it will end.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are offered fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by major companies, because the rent there is often not sustainable for retailers.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fanes: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>

<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market hall be located during the construction period?</seg>

<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which resemble almost imperceptibly - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarpassages, sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the sections out of the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publicly classified diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Translator and a groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment, by algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by maning, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment, not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but openly spoke about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg met just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In that, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while being in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed, so you got in contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned mice became unequal bridges, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama would actually demand only a few days after the book was released, to demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid splits that it should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation," the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is one of the above comic novels mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, how she emerges from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong with a hands-free telephon.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they strike your speech, they have won," "" "said it." ""</seg>

<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several years.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A public warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the scene, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been an associate professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubunker, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been appalled and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University co-operates with this investigation," "" "said Cubbage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"" "a speaker of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that" "" "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help U.S. investigative authorities in every possible way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he strongly urge the suspects to submit to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have a vision of their whereabouts and our efforts to locate them," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip who said something had happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as being very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"" "" "" "we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "" "Guglielmi said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2179">The Grand Plaza management team published an explanation of the inhabitants: "the police are currently working on the timeline and the victim's background and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"" "" "" "we will close the WADA roadmap in the near future" "" "- Russian Vice-President Mutko" ""</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"" "" "" "at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in co-operation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," "" "said Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented the WADA's second part in compliance with the code that describes the criteria for re-initiating RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "everything has been announced, everything is being implemented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities will have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on publicly funded doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "in reference to the matter," "" "we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no government programs and we won't admit anything that doesn't exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian selling point rsport at the start of the day, Smirnov gave problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "" "said Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal by the WADA by the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Aldi does not sell eggs for now anymore</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulently.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there has never been consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">It called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources start-ups is on the lookout to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow management to circumvent the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-in surveys and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the finance-technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent enables companies to send tailor-made "pulse" polls, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat-maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the public opinion condemns the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed more quickly as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can draw closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees commitment in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media" "" "came to their right," "" "that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors that have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Sapphire received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glistening secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and secured its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want you to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can reach yields if their portfolio companies run well. businesses run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the commitment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if change is not fast enough, or not at all, disappointments can grow and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be prepared to have 4.000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on gathering data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow workers ask," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and whomever you don't care about, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In the case of Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "and if you lose people, you lose customers too." ""</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose company.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 11pm when a lot of UCLA football players entertained on one side of the new training areas of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have moved out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these inactive minutes are a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise gone from the two days is more than a day at which the Brotherhood moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras carried out practical exercises in Westwood for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says melancholic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"" "" "" "what a personal relationship, keeping this letter in my hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his thumb print!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell like smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself was there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome message") this all seems too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats" said "Oh, throw it on the attic."</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that portray who owned what: "one could think that country conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go their way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm rebellion of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex "" "," Rhodes says. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start." ""</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrals are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell's men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent for advertising revenue. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique screaming experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and carriage in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week as well.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting no longer took place in the headquarters of the General Staff, as was before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The five Vice-Presidents and the Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the meetings under the chairmanship of the Heads of State.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This meant that civilians in the YAS were in excess.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government tightens the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army, mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile-preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a clinker of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people, who were allegedly involved in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara on this week.</seg>

<seg id="2353">"" "in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing" "" "Islamization" "" "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the abolition of the prohibition of head tubing for soldiers, the newspaper wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="2354">The empowerment of the army and the security forces continues at any rate.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of it, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them even more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adjust" "" "his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it gets more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman progressively look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables users to customize their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible," enthuses True Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day it also has its moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired of being fixed to conversation or she can" "" "be in the mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one approaches a step on Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) farrah, trouble one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site was True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR points out their growing popularity, they remain tentatively on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are popping up at a time when women's rights are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who boasted to have attacked women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrific aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphical images, the devoured body and the stamped eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intercession or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasies of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to say it in the message of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps high performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a link-wisdom of the trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all say it's supposed to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less was noticed the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has worked with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which they fought for decades on account of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was fortified by Trump, but the figuring effect of his presidency has the power to postpone us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the spooky possibility that his bibs will not expel us one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more complicated long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans are "normalized" in the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today, I find myself falling apart from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's ancestral version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When trump is concerned, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify themselves as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels in the New York car department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twisting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perishing music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the ThemePub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one of the major roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excruciously grating while I was tired of experiencing her credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to the first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nightly intruder that hid in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year custodial sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say that she is too transparent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National prosecution authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place has already been advertised - however, suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a City Engineer for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he mediates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has so far fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus - considering the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts as a Lower Building Law Office for the Administrative Community, the applicant must instruct appropriate degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they could not fill them out more, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But closeness to the citizens is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who talks about a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Designed for a city builder, there is a lot of room for manoeuvre.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move much," "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned praised by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the retiring city architect emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the city builder is responsible for a high degree of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is a client, "in the end, everything is going through my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">With care and coordination he can count on many years of co-operation: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">"" "Wacker doesn't want his successor, too:" "" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Who would like to be able to bury Roland Wacker, should have a completed academic studies in the town of Haslach as a graduate engineer or bachelor with the subject of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction planning and construction planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall out, but they were late.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study maintains exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the victim is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from it.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an diet rich in tryptophan will promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system also affects humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but which was accommodated separately, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and there were found six species of bacteria that were present in mice with the immune cells but were lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then carried small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active ingredient was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanals were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "in the presence of L. reuteri, high tryptophanals can potentially lead to an expansion of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU without his own government majority following the overstepping of the green deputies of Elke Twesten.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery started with unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland region in March.</seg>

<seg id="2673">In addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development informed Sengen on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been in sensations sanitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the sanitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Wuerttemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "successful project" - it is ultimately important to also promote interior development, and not only to open up new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros are from the country, the rest of the community's sensations.</seg>

<seg id="2682">"" "you will continue to explore, so Schindler, where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in the planned area in general.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the regional boundaries could then shift again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening, the bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme" "" "Social City" "", "in whose framework the restructuring would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and developing the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The sanitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The licensing period for the funding is running since 1 January 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, it would only be possible to take stock of the survey, in the context of those involved in the refurbishment area, to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the decree may take place as far as possible, so that in the coming year it can begin with the restructurings.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then explained that each commune must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2697">Gottwald emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The side of La League likes to regret their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not indulge in its persecution of Neymar after having issued an offer of £189 million to release its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the league 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the end, Neymar is becoming the most expensive player in the world and the world's highest-paying professional athlete. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way outside, although a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City in 2014 expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report stresses Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the Disabuses relieves the pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann writes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are the Church," declared a apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral capellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false estimation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "on the other hand, the Vatican magazine" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "criticised that in the reporting on violence in the Domspatzen" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In view of the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is a "shameful and shameful act" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee, is striking.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denouncing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go to the church and that is a fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that" "" "blows have been a normal educational tool" "" "in her youth," "" "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "it would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed." ""</seg>

<seg id="2901">"" "totally unjustified, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who wrote with Ratzinger the reminder" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Heshi," "" "for all that had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the findings of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report presented by Mr. Ulrich Weber who was appointed by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen "were victims of assault, 67 domes of domes sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that Master's master R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotional quality, the punishment for the students was even more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "in contrast to many other accused, many victims" "" "valued" "" "the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even consider positive memories with him in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Ezekier explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violent exercise in the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a clerk and perfectionist, which has become palpable, when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is generally found in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is currently dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exempt from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, it is possible to reproach him, to experience it too late, or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as" "" "redemption" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, portray him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "proficient" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always lagged" by children's grapes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has also led to quarries.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he not only skinned with chairs and threw the keyring on the ground, but also pulled ear-blades and overlooked cheeky guys in the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologised for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It must be said, however, that such educational methods were widespread in the period from the 1960s and 1970s, both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is about in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, these are indeed bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it does not have to do with his acquaintance and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who have never understood him are still working eagerly at the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, much talked about the issue of misuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be exposed in the final report also some involvement or co-knowing with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have committed himself to the master's master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "" "said one of those affected," "" "everything was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the clarification of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you evaluate Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable disciple put it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective offender.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that... Buben have opened up more vividly and clearly or rather than to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report concludes with the clear result:" "" "that students and / or their environment affected them in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Nor can he be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgusting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "excesses" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former mayor Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge range of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"" "because it is cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the" "" "Domspatzen" "", "between sexual abuse and violence and, let's say, other accusations." ""</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the cathedral-sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly slanted and maladjusted, all of them occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domain gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "that was, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the subject" "" "pre-school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape, and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: indeed, there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims" valued the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even consider positive memories with him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported to him by the conditions at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (thus the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989, he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he pointed out that" "" "in the pre-school, the test penalty will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test penalties were also banned in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows still.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might exaggerate or dramatize and where the permitted limit has actually been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just isn't true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "meaning the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that then practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection, for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, to drag ear-blades and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment, it was strictly forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture from his Regensburg times did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject matter of testing also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, because the domes only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all give away that he had a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this too must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-trang institution, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy you alone don't make a big singer out of rebellious boys and stand before every success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you see when Georg Ratzinger lived in the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, groundless, deeply faithful and heart-good people, from which one can't imagine that he could also do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with him, like many former domites, 23 years after his expiration, visit him regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domes are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.</seg>
