28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , shared the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS broad@@ ca@@ ster K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had won his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will pain@@ fully miss him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to combine his family with his family was to make us cook for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of discussion .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that brigh@@ tened every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has the information to the case will be asked to call the reference on the S@@ F@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always stuck in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has clearly made this clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be stuck in drawers or get stuck from the outside label which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have not the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she explains in the latest &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , a television with a relaxed de@@ bris and Mexican food , she says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the White @-@ Flo@@ od , she asks the question of the child &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variation with a ride on the beach with some colleagues .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they gal@@ lo@@ ped back home to the feeding trou@@ ghs .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and this was the end of the riding career .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses .
he had his family run over the AL@@ RV plant , on a horse he did not even bo@@ ar for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
in the context of a small gala , the man from Germany handed over the golden sports pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen .
the li@@ ke@@ able sports@@ man does not lack any distinc@@ tions .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver R@@ lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen had already rebu@@ ked him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting young people for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master champion was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performers are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the former Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ wers Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza rate went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
comparing Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trading agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton under@@ lie a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wanted to control the economy and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will go back to massive regulation , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money for it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in that need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost equal .
the democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be party @-@ internal discussions on tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant .
tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining back in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , it wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both of them don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but just want to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid better then , like Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what tr@@ ump wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to get up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the large discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more in favour of the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , is standing up to boost growth .
his critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
in the Munich North , they live in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for single @-@ leaf women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
recently it was officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ carriers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , court of honour , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany , B@@ ahr is telling .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and at worst ab@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what is experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations just for them , B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their area of competence , some respond with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of the governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fle@@ dged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women easily , is included in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistants argue : demands for new work @-@ fighting measures
assistant physicians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute with regard to a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work in early September .
the J@@ DC said it would have ab@@ used ministers to respond to concerns about the contract .
resident doctors and medical students voted in favour of the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA in July .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have had problems , leading to the refusal of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work campaigns starting in early September .
the dispute led to the fact that this year &apos;s investig@@ ators quar@@ rel@@ ed six times , the first total cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA resident physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms , which had been recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistant physicians and medical students , with the conclusion that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s s@@ miles appeared de@@ vili@@ sh@@ ly and hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly about his &quot; loving friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the firing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was rage .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re@@ build the cous@@ in is difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media made a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all .
the most serious charges were the accus@@ ations from senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but St. Petersburg &apos;s official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire lie clearly on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends that he can get after he has been dismissed by almost his ministry last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated attacks against Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are economic motives as well .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports were allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , as its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power is regarded as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail stamp of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ ped to benefit from the cool sen@@ timent and l@@ essen the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus for ensuring that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he called for support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present , as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that have been rejected and badly treated by the West and are now f@@ ading away .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents of the press conference said that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least once again talk to each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s chief executive , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , trademark strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more national brands on them .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing at Nat@@ West will change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved his 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne with a double at New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori ensured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market .
he set a milestone on pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pigment god , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it has happened at New@@ market because I have landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori be@@ holds the che@@ er when he wins the victory on pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester pigment , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career prospects
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern times and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a fans have been enthusiastic about this sport for many years .
I told Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already won 6,000 prizes if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbelievable jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying disp@@ en@@ ots , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; in 1996 , in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug prohibition .
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character of character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of life .
Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov , Chief of Staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it reads that without stating grounds , Putin ordered the release Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was an Ivan@@ ov@@ s deputy since 2012 , has been appointed as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later became the log boss and chief of staff of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin announced on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysti@@ cal .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ dan@@ te and works as he did for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy , met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - to entr@@ ust the aining post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been President of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy .
when Putin came to power he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most .
Ivan@@ ov once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , President of Russia could become President of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son recru@@ ited after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their dis@@ mis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his notice .
on the set , there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character of Gib@@ sons from the series follows , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , are expected to be released at a later date according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart &apos;s blood into it for the past twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a show .
the scheduled transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could trade to Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were mirr@@ ored by a fountain of fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives 500 meters from the sea , on Per@@ is@@ cope released a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ boat Crossing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 be@@ vel cables .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs , Kei@@ th Brown , visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure is a trend @-@ setting high and low construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the gap to the north or the north .
this was achieved by pulling the northern extension bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate as the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side , they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y hanging without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this was released by the bo@@ unc@@ ing of the boat from the person who was steering the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .

who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors should be taken into duty much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing concept for housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the SPD , Christoph Brat@@ mann , comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in agreement with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments will have to exhibit in the future as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
however , the great controversy in the town hall is , &quot; says Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but build as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new municipal housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement at the moment between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants to impose tough@@ er conditions for investors .
no matter how viol@@ a , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which were to be built anyway .
but how to compensate for the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments whose funding will exp@@ ire over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to prevent this , the planning oli@@ ver Nicole Palm , should now purchase out@@ going bonds from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about returning apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in West@@ stadt there are periods of time at the end of the year .
around 1800 units could be picked up there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : these do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased again , one gets away from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be any movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be in the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been concentr@@ ating on more building sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time watching screens has been be@@ mo@@ aned by many in the last decade .
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture dropped the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something .
market launch in other countries has been shifted by the massive demand that over@@ loads the servers .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , can be &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and j@@ umped for the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person puts back every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who exercise 30 minutes each day , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health which people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit de@@ af ears , because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ estimated .
anyone who is doing sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors to make them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what &apos;s to be done ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity in the past , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will leave with time .
however , because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies &apos; gymn@@ as@@ tics
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant all the way .
and now also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast announced on Thursday for the multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ team Kam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating beam during the individual campaign of women in gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has won over the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected her last examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged after winning gold and silver in the single @-@ campaign in@@ ale of women in gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition competition , a winning series that will continue as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was easy through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
floating beams and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner than the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her ground exercise she threw down kis@@ ses to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the start of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot dead on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ held weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look to see if it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in His@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two more wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard Johnson shared with C@@ BS , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liners , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I did not .
I can &apos;t do that .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one sat down on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund could never recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first response to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor scratch until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund answered for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News told .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t been asked about the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect anyone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it &apos;s getting better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National weather service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that government officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and were already on the move to the municipalities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood cars , boats and sand@@ bags were increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a floo@@ ding warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that an additional 3 to 5 inch rain could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the subur@@ b opposite Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these flows through the tro@@ dden rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still dra@@ ined people from flood waters in the areas of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , greatly hei@@ gh@@ tens overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flo@@ ated in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that the emergency hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the nearest fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation procedures into account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was considerably balanced by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classes in five districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary web @-@ trav@@ eller reported that there were 200 floo@@ ded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which now both were floo@@ ded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had res@@ cu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed because of the flood and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents , hoping to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the disaster manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but there were no reported on Friday .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pun@@ ched by spheres , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the lo@@ ins , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital for his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was en@@ gros@@ sed by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ endu@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot on , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether there could be one of the wounded men of the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ ics for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , were crow@@ ding the crime scene .
it seems that this was clearly a continuing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were seals .
in this way , there seem to have been several armed fighters who were involved very actively , &quot; police min@@ it@@ rac@@ tor Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di told the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ port@@ edly checking the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police is still searching for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present in the gymn@@ as@@ tics event in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls from other skin colours .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ licon is round , makes everybody proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected , yet master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold in an individual campaign for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t look like classes across the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all took the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , it is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are a cost@@ lier sport and gymn@@ asts are first and foremost in private gy@@ ms maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these sports clubs are located in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs , which can support business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts get their whole training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained their athletes since they started their gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to provide a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access exercise training to the communities of n inn@@ um@@ erable young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie .
I founded my Turn@@ sti@@ Foundation of 20 years .
during my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that invites thousands of young girls to get interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gold and thank you for having so many young girls with backgrounds in order to start their way to becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
resident doctors want to organize further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians who voted in favour of a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the Treaty on a forced basis and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistants are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and week @-@ dates in order to improve the care at irregular hours .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the B@@ MA committee for assistance doctors announced last night in a message with : &quot; resident doctors have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current crisis of the workforce and it will be used to address all physicians . &quot;
in only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by discussions clas@@ hed with the government for reluc@@ tance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month that his door would always open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the vibration and address the concerns of the assistant physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistant physicians have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work @-@ fighting measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strip post .
the ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to have a better week@@ day wage for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , called on the assistant physicians to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work Camp@@ aig@@ ns do not reach little , but already load over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing homes and their families only concerns , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the investig@@ ator &apos;s committee and responded positively to concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training ch@@ ests , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training plac@@ ements , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training course and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May were .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after the authorities advised to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ulations Committee recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long exposure to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ulations Committee recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long exposure to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form plaque .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots break , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already have a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the line design of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rec@@ tness culture leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year for the dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a crus@@ hing government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now an antagon@@ ism king , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up barriers outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
he recommends that voters should carry out an identification card in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply distant ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote in order to prevent someone to choose twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric says .
it requires that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but is also meant to protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s Choice V@@ ou@@ cher in the east of London .
last year , a special local court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was to be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man allegedly per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person chooses to vote as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of dec@@ eption throughout the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of postal voting - in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading out clu@@ es to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , especially communities with a Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ anga background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have ignor@@ antly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said fifty recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists process brief@@ ing documents to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires harder registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for migration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use remo@@ ve@@ able ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on proposals for an automatic postal choice .
ban that political activists manipul@@ ate complete letters and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ heads .
the police have the power to set up lock@@ outs around electoral stations .
the amend@@ ment made it easier to prosec@@ ute the prosecution for intim@@ id@@ ation according to the People Act of 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Dec@@ ree 1983 ) .
no photography in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the bal@@ lot stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that employees generally en@@ force that voters go to the bal@@ lot alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election tri@@ bunal has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy un@@ fit for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the electoral departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents , has a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week have won the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T out of the border and the band , which proved to be an impressive doubles predecessor of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic med@@ ina is by far not the only ath@@ lete competing in gold that has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to give faith to the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the moment on our screens , F@@ email has compiled a list of Olymp@@ ians that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet showed how a certain arch@@ ery could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in the Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa , with her big expressive eyes , is supposed to go through the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African Swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the inc@@ eption act@@ ress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va points more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
a Twitter user declared their cont@@ ent@@ ment that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are nearly identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Gymn@@ ast Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds &apos;s analysis about the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year old Ai or Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle @-@ call@@ ous stir@@ red Sp@@ ect@@ ators of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went down like low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds comment@@ ator thought his microphone was off when he was playing his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle J@@ aff@@ el .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was brought into the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited he went away like a pig , and died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ai or Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which made it possible for the Canadian to close the gap to China .
people in Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator have just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai P@@ ond from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cri@@ tique of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , many of whom were talking to him
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets all of us look like ra@@ cists . # stu@@ ffed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the commentary was broad@@ cast@@ ed on a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt about Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they will be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ fortunate chosen wording . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the con@@ sign@@ ment and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympic programme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who tried under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ ly to taste under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at her as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman recru@@ ited the pants before she put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went on and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of pants from the delivery , pulled her own trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she und@@ ressed the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she did not like anything , re@@ treated and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther anyone watching - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how re@@ pul@@ sive to think that someone would take shelter with him who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to withdraw the garments from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate going home with a new pair of under@@ pants and finding out that another woman had her and und@@ ressed and she hadn &apos;t been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were withdrawn from sales .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks using Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the spe@@ ar around for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move out of the gun line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
then strike it with the knee in the l@@ ath and twist while the attack@@ er is cro@@ oked before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight on the weapon and beat the aggres@@ sor on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and turning the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is the saf@@ est way to over@@ ride your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right che@@ ered for a guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller subjected his immune system and dignity to a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his train to a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before sett@@ ling each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought of replacing the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact , more bad bacteria are in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left , what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known for testing the resistance of his gut by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing buttons of toilets , the task posed its immune system definitely to a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test painting showed a lumin@@ ous number of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse , after their lumin@@ ous lumin@@ ance was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here anything here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; validation Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things with which it was easier to get Ian , to check them out and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey carried out by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed prior to Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls had holes perfor@@ ated , wooden boards were torn down , garbage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment could no longer be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be demoli@@ shed under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to be inv@@ oked by the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ zed her and her partner this week violent by the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not ashamed of anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived beside them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have agreed to co @-@ operate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years
on the over@@ grown side of the community house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant promised to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as del@@ o@@ gens are always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and provided the information to us .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that was left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ vation on the ground .
workers of property management will now have to swe@@ ep the garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ on was given a fine after she found guilty of ow@@ ning a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son , Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says they will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row by De@@ von and Corn@@ wall reported that del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who were har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a pep@@ pered jet crashed into a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers woke up when they learned to worry about the noise of the nozzle carri@@ ages without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;

tourists at Av@@ eiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the bad visibility the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility conditions , but the air forces ins@@ ist that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people also died on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke .

Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the US Republi@@ cans &apos; leadership is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ track and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire utter@@ ed such a thing as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , before evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media art .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds remain shaking
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the Clinton advancing : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump has threatened to raise funds for the support of his campaign , he should not be able to present any better surveys .
instead of this , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans for Congress would be stronger than their arms .
Olympics : three Sc@@ am in the Dop@@ ing Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after a fraud trial in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach to Kenya .
the International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had informed that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village , gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as by dop@@ ing controllers .
IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , gave the trial and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan team leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
in the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , Kenya has been under special observation for quite some time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Olympics , it has been noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic commen@@ cement .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is conform to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have always been raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sport fraud .
member of the IO@@ C , Richard Po@@ und , recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it was proved that in this sport , nationwide and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
this is a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she reminds of her boy@@ friend Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first of all , because it is extraordinary musi@@ cally !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with it .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the off@@ ert@@ ories went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same themes , and they are just as expressive today as at the time .
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London &apos;s school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school ma@@ ids who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ sk@@ je@@ e &apos;s lawyer said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died according to her family &apos;s information shortly after she had decided to leave the war @-@ torn country and to return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ sk@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London went aboard a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .

Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , believes that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton expects Gary to &quot; pick up Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about a new candidate .
gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Republi@@ cans blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
tre@@ ath wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine differs from Old@@ school Play@@ boys because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the Calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the representation of timeless and classic nude , where women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the release of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally with open Cast@@ ing Appe@@ al in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is seated on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ ds community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of prot@@ ectors who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh presence of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protection @-@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had already covered millions of Kur@@ ds with pris@@ ons a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey .
according to the s@@ worn put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state which takes refugees itself , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the association accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
Erdo@@ gan is to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal President demanded that the Federal Government position itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany too , there is a witch @-@ hunt against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is seated on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the c@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ Stiftung Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper with reference to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already set up the largest group of asylum @-@ seek@@ ers accepted by political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on the reporting date June 30 , 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all persons who were entitled to obtain asylum had been eligible ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey there are not those who fled from war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum Rights in accordance with the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
the Parliament of Schwer@@ in has already decided at the beginning of the year , which will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays 2021 .
because stupid as so far it does not work : summer holidays , heat and country elections - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the freedom fighters , are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country are on the way to Use@@ dom , Rügen , Hid@@ den@@ see and are not locals .
in addition , there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ating ballo@@ ons , distributing fl@@ yers and counting voices in the end , only lab@@ ori@@ ously .
by September 4 , 2016 , the last day of the election and the last holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign shortly before the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
it will be exciting , how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ alism .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and heads of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , is seen from his major posters .
he travels through the countryside , spreads ro@@ ses and chat@@ ters a little with the people , just as his legendary word predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , counsel@@ ing has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the blo@@ om of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale environments ; Merkel &apos;s Federal Chancellor is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a shame even to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and shopping centres with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , said Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has realised that on the land you will crum@@ ble the base so that it must be very strict again to find a wire to the people .
you find it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U election warri@@ or Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , any birthday celebration must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD won a clear victory at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of their vac@@ ations and mostly lay their election campaign on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; states the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on search for local stimul@@ ants among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being rehabil@@ itated .
there are all praise for those responsible for the construction work , which starts at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and only ends at about 20 o &apos;clock in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything quite exc@@ essively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week as scheduled , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the receipt will also be commen@@ ded to those responsible for the construction works , such as when it comes to setting up residence trips .
since the construction site emig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was revers@@ ed and that the connection to Rot@@ tenburg exists again , the traffic situation within the place has eased .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Vice President Florian King , responsible for the rehabilitation management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ gen@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ ground had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and rather familiar with their navigation device than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks par@@ aded in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have already been fired two to three times per minute .
the quick@@ est was traveling at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg , the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to revenue losses in them makes everyone look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the renovation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also states that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no rum@@ our of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most crowded places are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the restaurants were &quot; hit hard . &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be happy about every euro &apos;s turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he reduced the sales revenues to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ marking has thrown his farm back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his associates .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President @-@ president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more gener@@ ously handled has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business is settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t approach it , it &apos;s also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ client@@ ele comes back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises associated with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly being bol@@ ted to laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package .
but what has a divor@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the con@@ sig@@ ner .
all his proposals were politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package .
they do not challenge anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also treat myself to this .
as Minister of the Interior , however , he was able to achieve results and a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère spent a little time passing before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the un@@ encrypted communication is not new .
nor is the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives on passenger data and ce@@ ase@@ fire .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies does not come as a surprise either .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère embark@@ s on a second attempt on proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still holds this for reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that doesn &apos;t have a chance in the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
some of them have it in themselves : he plans fast methods for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ting people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of divor@@ ces for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some worse than previously - such as those who commit criminal off@@ ences or deliberately reject their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally tri@@ cky .
some of them also have an un@@ mixed effect and leaves open questions .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in the face of the high numbers of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that were deeply engaged by the people could not be wa@@ sted even in times of election .
the focus is on inner security .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election competitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking position in the topic of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few days between the two parties it was high .
it was only a secret dispute over the features of the Federal Police , and then on a security policy collection of some of the interior ministers of the Union , in which the resort leaders also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling to reconci@@ le sounds .
he thinks nothing of a return from a double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ended the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ open it is not sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally objec@@ tion@@ able at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , has to show itself first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it that could take care of stri@@ fe .
but the SPD , too , is currently trying to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet Volkswagen is still running gli@@ mm@@ ingly .
in spite of diesel locomo@@ tives , the delivery numbers increase worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the recall action , there are vor@@ tices around a term .
in the second half of the year , Volkswagen will remain cau@@ tious in deliveries .
despite the diesel engines , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to demonstrate a plus in spite of the diesel engines due to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the VW brand , especially in Western Europe , slow@@ ed down the total sales , as stated by the company listed in the D@@ ax .
at 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe , the second most important market in China alone , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year period .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of sales , drove the weaker figures from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the need for res@@ ignation from the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained .
in the US , where the exhaust gas has initially escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the primarily affected house brand of the Lower Saxony will continue to gli@@ mm@@ et by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent will be charged to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales growth from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software package test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling approximately 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting in the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW confirms that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not cause any deterioration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after ref@@ itting the car , the car manufacturer ordered a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for this is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now grant its German customers a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after ref@@ itting do not take place after the conversion and all type @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; however , as it was said in corporate circles .
for example , with the wide concept of &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen has the possibility that , for example , customers come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage , which has nothing to do with the gas sc@@ andal , a uncertainty about possible warranty rules comes as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich savers in future criminal interest rates - a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; head chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day @-@ to @-@ day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers need to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their austerity demands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties .
this fee will return the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund in September from private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding EUR 100,000 to bank or day accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 euro in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he has be@@ ware of 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the next , and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays the costs he now proceeds .
leaving the cash simply in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank saf@@ es would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the board chairman .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative society Bayern said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible economically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with criminal interest for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , so the competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele which is more luxuri@@ ously endow@@ ed by wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if she would care for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the Co@@ operative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known to any other banks that calculate a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of June , the President of the German National Bank and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition was tough , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .

destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged loving s@@ labs .
before heading to the comment section , in order to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ a Men &apos;s Middle Ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the rec@@ u@@ emergence of sound plates is not attributable to a bo@@ oming in Mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ al@@ gie .
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ de by amateur collectors - it has an emotional significance : older people of the record retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and stu@@ d@@ ded wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something bad about it : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o slowly for@@ fei@@ ts its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such deals and try to estimate their age and mood by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they appeared and bought new items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records tend to be more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the board revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a store like F@@ onica to see record stores offering a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took imp@@ etus to the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , of objects that evo@@ ke happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to get into mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a stack of plates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month had not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smo@@ ther through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a tro@@ phy aspect of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here just recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ class .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly come into it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ opp , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records , has a lower audience than I am going into . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are couples around the 70 , tourists that make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ them@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ming from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but the psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of the plates for sale .
it makes window bum@@ ps rather than a big shopping .
it does not earn much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I appear to give the appearance of pants for pants , I watch a group of young girls group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality , record stores and online forums is un@@ taken into account .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with st@@ rolling through disks of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through boards , while avoiding the star@@ ing view of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who stands above the shoulders of un@@ susp@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on dis@@ arm@@ ament of shops in the jungle of refugees
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops in which people sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be pulled down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and that would have a fire and health risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that temporary businesses and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a L@@ ille court ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional trading operations , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than to feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the fall @-@ down was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly used and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help refugees and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants appreciated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer .
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic calendar , he didn &apos;t want to get back to Tony Martin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I continue to keep the world cup in sight , remain confident and fight ahead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really hard for me to comment on the time @-@ drive of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed over the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the triple Time @-@ Time World Champion , who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the 5@@ 4,5 km Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

watching other people playing video games is a huge thing - Microsoft wants to benefit from that too .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give players up missions and face enemies and provide equipment .
the game giant Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook is said to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ up staff , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to Microsoft &apos;s headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i informed .
the tak@@ eover should therefore not change anything for the customers .
Be@@ am is integrated in the video game department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market of video games is growing rapidly .

T@@ witch was purchased from the online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for nearly one billion dollars .

here comes the reinforcement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ ur@@ er : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are intended to transfer Tem@@ po@@ urs particularly effectively .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , on accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary flash for compliance with speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
reinforcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement mode , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as dri@@ ve@@ ways according to time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state with each car with trailer coupling .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also shot @-@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested and used by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states since 2015 .
also foreign authorities are flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain takes silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji holds Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ year @-@ long rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they hit the De@@ e Stadium in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back @-@ back , line @-@ up and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sevilla under Ry@@ an .
here they only get one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and caused the attacks to boun@@ ce off G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a h@@ ass@@ le @-@ free tackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but Fi@@ ji has only stopped .
in the seventh minute Ath@@ lete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua went down a touch@@ down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ eted by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and rus@@ hed to the line to make a fool .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still gut@@ ted .
that &apos;s the way it is .
GB took fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an void ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant g@@ ame@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the southern se@@ ater , whose fans sang , flags wave and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ ff sounds , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked out crus@@ hing in the law@@ ns .
earlier this day , Fi@@ ji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown got the Bo@@ ks in the first half for@@ wards , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate below the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for a ru@@ dder victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic gold than with those games and that wants what .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , which go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was omni@@ present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic champion in the two @-@ wheel@@ er without a control woman , the first women in the history of British Sports , who laid such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ defeated use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes , gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not completely reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the trainer , who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and this was what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if this was the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ raising morning to talk something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a mission in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something special .
today we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exemplary clarity for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , retired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ expe@@ dient as a model for the big water producers .
so it was said that some time ago , the original sound was made in a contribution from Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia fla@@ iled the con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was a member of the ken@@ nel for 31 years , 28 years of age as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water sport association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the congregations of the church of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water supply contracts are available for other cities and municipalities .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ n mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler set up as a water go@@ ver in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Board of Directors in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , purchase of land in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial innovations of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and I have repeatedly added innovations because water is water and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose @-@ association down@@ right as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for the reduction of nit@@ rate in front of the water forum of Unter@@ fran@@ ken district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler on his part praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water go@@ ver and he was a faithful cra@@ p .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
he described the well @-@ construction and re @-@ structuring of the co@@ er@@ cion @-@ association as highlights from his point of view .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the tu@@ bing in the high container at the church lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work through the whole night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n was also possible only because one filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water pur@@ ge association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well advanced and now I &apos;m learning privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that dates back two years , when I sang at the Teatro alla Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Schrot@@ t .
she is now married to ten@@ or Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship Consul@@ tant in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man sho@@ ots on partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and mort@@ ally wounded them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself inv@@ oked and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I am publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile nationwide because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald head .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon in himself , according to the police .
if you see Sven S. , you should call 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ness or the relationship between the perpetr@@ ator and the victim , but she confirmed that a human had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operation command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of euros .
financial burdens threatened by the sector of green electricity subsidies are from the table .
it remains with the release of the renewable energy situation in the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a draft agreement with the European Commission for talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced are an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but this too will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production .
as a result , the status quo of the present regulation is largely fixed .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions trading trade , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe suffered over@@ capacity and considerable pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China dropped massive steel to the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat eased .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand , economic prospects in China have increased .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again rather .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung Stahl shared on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back the second month after each other .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , spirit , health : singing does good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s study she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing inspir@@ es me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German Re@@ ti@@ rement division .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors may soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because social and family structures often dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as they are in everyday life .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
singing often has a very special effect on older people , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
in the older generations common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people is awakening many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ denied people are de@@ vis@@ ing long past events .
in singing , a special power is required for the head , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time concentr@@ ating on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially the elderly , who live alone , do not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise something for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are plenty of good reasons to start singing .
whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who list@@ ens when a sound goes next to it ?
looking for the right offer , Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , say H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ bly as males to scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover which effect has the reputation of cat babies on adult animals .
to their surprise , the Mi@@ ghty also did not let the males get cold - however they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat babies in the eyes of the little ones .
they react faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens ten percent faster than scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently , the acousti@@ cal differences between the ch@@ ewing of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the cat @-@ cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ment of little ones who were taken from the throw @-@ box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , responded discre@@ et@@ ly to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they rot@@ ated faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women react more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter if they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann said .
Po@@ dol@@ sky acc@@ uses with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former German football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , there will be another important football match in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ ell of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency occurred after the coup attempt in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
at the same time , football is not stopped .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former strong Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
according to this , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kis@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
the first exceptional condition for 90 days is still valid until October , but actually it has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be terminated on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the Labour club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what unites the size of the Turks , but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is especially time to get to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory finish .
after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; will leave early in the Europa League .
in the South of Li@@ g there was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year went better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rem@@ ent@@ ö@@ nig , laid the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was under contract with the AC Florence , had only announced that it would not return to the country after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after its European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club boss Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to do so , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce approximately one @-@ third of his estimated annual salary , estimated at around one @-@ third of his estimated $ 7.5 million . &quot; we cannot pay his Florence salary . &quot;
despite Dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als in Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other superior athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who compl@@ ained about his starting right after a Dop@@ ing lock , was amp@@ ut@@ ated mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) and rested .
there was a bizarre scene : with a s@@ miles she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when she realised that she was not going to get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering storm .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the Dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ line ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked already twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been even faster than before ; it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after having been proven to take the pain@@ killer with Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and Europe champi@@ onships was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied thorough ing@@ es@@ tion and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion about 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , che@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world so far .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ reproach , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete was subsequently recognised as many med@@ als .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give Olympics silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championship due to testosterone abuse .
he was also recognized as the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games based on a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champi@@ onships , references to taking a banned food supplement were found , the ban of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA deterior@@ ated mil@@ dly and was already running on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again .
she planned her home trip at the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , it is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as waste .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives then went up again , another human being killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the bathing beach of Pat@@ ong , popular with vac@@ ation@@ ers , was viol@@ ated by a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , at the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the territory of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast , demanded several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; said Brig@@ adi@@ er Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not associated with the Islam@@ ist insurrection movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
the authorities have received secret references in the past few days on im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - though they were not informed about the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed its officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings in Thailand , but they are usually not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years by Thailand King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian State Department recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary trips to these provinces are being depl@@ eted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , considers itself to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not been able to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
nearly a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become the target of the Federal Office for Constitutional Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several regional offices , the constitutional guar@@ dians in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ arian Movement &apos; we see evidence for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß der Deutschen Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants of Islamic belief or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely aligned with the country &apos;s offices in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts generally try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a pra@@ y@@ er@@ ful advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda is intended to appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ize said he did not know any findings .
possible contacts of this species are only relevant for the protection of the constitutional complaint from a certain point onwards .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - will change its direction by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the clear increase of law@@ less crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ unab@@ o said he would not talk about new righ@@ tist terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be no right @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , there is no indication of a nationwide or European @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
they were worried about the fact that many attacks on the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ rying phenomenon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum accommodation had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been in@@ different politically or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD and lef@@ ti@@ sts , who then radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an interim
the Olympic Games and the World Records not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro summer games .
in the Aqu@@ atics center , the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia mo@@ aned so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his pre @-@ race with a reset of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty character that drew the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more well known in under@@ represented countries .
since most sports@@ men walk in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ names made the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wh@@ ale of wh@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy chamber from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a pre @-@ race over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim in front of Olympia at the age of eight and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then asc@@ ends to the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately , it will either fold or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC .
if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
so he described US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
mail climb@@ s into the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vessel is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the company will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post wants to offer their electric vehicles on the free market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been testing whether it should sell its self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other farms .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always inquiries , such as arti@@ sans .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner company will shortly be entering the mass production of the vehicles .
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ ber announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will take a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;

GF@@ RP leadership dec@@ lines after dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly appeared - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K fores@@ had@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann became even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing results and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the worldwide number five of the industry is ahead of a new beginning .
the GF@@ RP chief executive wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the supervisory body with effect from September 12 .
as of September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board pres@@ ided over the former board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger , and shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who will be conducting the market research company in the future is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in investors &apos; circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders last had been disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the head of the Gf@@ K .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will eventually become un@@ settled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company was unable to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were up 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
relative to the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros contracted by 3.4 percent .
earnings in the second quarter imp@@ acted primarily by the decreased value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company assets amounting to EUR 139 million , which were necessary in the Consumer Experience division , generated a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million to the Group .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K recorded a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in the case of an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , told the police .
according to her specifications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel agency in Eisen@@ ach had to give her particulars to an accommo@@ dating vice , some of whom drove on the opposite track .
the bus departed to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as reported by the spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the scene of the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured traveler was brought back by a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a substitute coach of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the lor@@ ry drivers and witnesses to report to the police .
as of 1 October 2016 , the charges per cubic metre of eff@@ lu@@ ent will be 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget , Kul@@ mb@@ ach district office has established that under@@ cover works for these sewage plants .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to take a deeper look into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Manager Herbert Schmidt explained to the body , a new calculation of fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overl@@ apping or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will also be offset .
in all three se@@ wer@@ age facilities , Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with relatively small facilities with a very low san@@ itation , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair , the previous calculation period of all three plants did not last considerably due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old .
Schmidt referred to the fact that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf due to damage .
in the pump plant Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and at the pond sewage plant L@@ opp , after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation slot had to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low wastewater treatment in the three plants , the expenses for operation and sub@@ sist@@ ence were &quot; fully exploited . &quot;
in the past 20 years , Schmidt , the market town of large entertainment costs , continued to be spar@@ ed .
the situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , as the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal waste water @-@ association could not be extended because it is a deficit disorder .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; Health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education remains unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ on critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it &apos;s not sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be a painting from Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are unver@@ i@@ fied , self @-@ winding tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all absen@@ ces arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of promoting black face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it proposed to some users a filter that gave them s@@ lit @-@ eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow vision . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es showed a greater problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat informed that it had turned the feature off .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was conceived as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely used on the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and bar@@ ren . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very conflic@@ ting Asian carto@@ on and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yel@@ low@@ ness has been drag@@ ged into the out@@ going extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older antagon@@ ists - could be more likely to assume sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult for such things to stay un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes rac@@ ist @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the adjustment practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part of white , just male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has left largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat le@@ aned to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently hired a HR officer , concentr@@ ating on subordin@@ ate population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , on the other hand , said that she will shut down her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS secret service information , set up Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence gathering information to sign an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed on site , a report of the congress was announced in a report on Thursday .
the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report , created by a Republi@@ can Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Army Committee , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Mis@@ sile Com@@ mit@@ es , reported a great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret services analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their appreciation to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically no@@ d@@ ded by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com carto@@ graph@@ ers , regularly drawn a positive image of US efforts against terrorism when the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive than analysis of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , a Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed constant problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications suggest@@ ing that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , opinions and statements submitted to Congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sad could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into their lives after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports about the Islamic State .
the report , which was published on Thursday , will be completed by more detailed findings while investigations are resum@@ ed .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are under way by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for creating post @-@ intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the committee , member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised mor@@ als among analysts and gave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moder@@ ately little room for dis@@ s@@ enting opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; preliminary results of the proceedings of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , which was recorded after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , there was a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also insist@@ ed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful campaign of air under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a written document about how the then government under George W. Bush did not fores@@ ee only a small occupation force in Iraq and left little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current media coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker noted that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com dam@@ al@@ iger Command@@ l@@ sh@@ aber , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
the US is winning fourth match in the women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with Great Britain faces
one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
this is what she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path that the other group will lead .
however , as always the game may start on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 squares during the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey bat in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Champion of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , became the coach of the national team and thus began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ ra@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back hand from close @-@ up .
India had gone into play without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball through the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ aped the ball in the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament &apos;s tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel steadily and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band protecting to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ overl@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there &apos;s Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by Sp@@ ons@@ ors and well @-@ being TV ads , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic style .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade , the sports that are not generally accepted are : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swim and may it reign long .
but if I think I should make arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ ms of the trampoline .
although jumping on the trampoline is an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many of whom I had questioned did not know that it is at all an olymp@@ ic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian ones for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds appropriate for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
asp@@ iring winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , hat@@ s and o@@ int@@ ages ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympic program , they are rated according to the performance , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alists hope to go further , faster , up and down in their pursuit of gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall , but also a further highlight in the TV transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the targeted pursuit is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a viewer into tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing space of this .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she colli@@ des , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant ann@@ ul@@ ment of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympic @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by getting the male ath@@ lete and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police in shooting .
is Ethiopia really going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests erup@@ ted against the government and expanded into more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen were firing and killing dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests that are likely to be from the last or earlier of this year show how security men beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to turn a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now calls for a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led to repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , while dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options other than protest , it breaks off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ j@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
one generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on the power of the governing coalition .
following a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ ade , which were forced more or less in recent years , could use the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness now explo@@ de after years of concei@@ ving it under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians claimed that they were so protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death on an un@@ published disease in 2012 .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process enemies and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively op@@ a@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Africa , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands protest against elections which , according to analysts , were apparently su@@ cked by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but evi@@ dently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal ignorance of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian town , managed by Tig@@ ray , and hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although she recently informed her that she has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin net migration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried on Friday to disper@@ se the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ling that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communications capabilities of the Republi@@ cans &apos; presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gible with the American public .
it also brings its comrades who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to have to explain statements which he could not have meant at all .
after making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump posted back on the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed on interviews that he really did not intend to point out , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement somewhat by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the sake of falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again .
reporting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he had a strong criticism of himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I thought it &apos;s sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to res@@ h@@ ape as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has received an even more corro@@ sive tone , as his surveys have continued to decline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a major lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but as he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent princes , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them Hin@@ du@@ sts , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by setting it aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania last Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump carried on his attacks on the media and accused them of re@@ treating each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ fit for the Pres@@ idency .
once beyond the price of the market , café is returning to Green@@ point
verb Cafe was a nice cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served excellent coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices were crowded out of Bed@@ ford Avenue store .
soap Cher@@ ie shop , replaced by Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people felt it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excep@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also new invention .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing member of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot of things .
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ te onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers have also been displaced by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prizes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer recently on a Sunday .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and regularly visited the verb .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the path .
after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was coffee and culture in the verb that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , although on that day they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new additive instead of their usual iced coffee .
since the beginning of 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ standing and faithful customer .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ wing coffee with coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he planned to exhibit it soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice restaurant would like to fill and sell cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding onto a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the ordering of a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing meal of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Fi@@ fth Avenue delicacies such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small local snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , Turkey ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter ordered dul@@ ent ro@@ ast , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ uts , cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served fresh baked p@@ ies for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the paths with which the country was going to no longer be the land of milk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central , ten@@ se theme in the food for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; argued Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole could re@@ unite as a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ unite food residues &quot; as coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
strange mixtures were tried , because a high @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction was given preced@@ ence over taste or even common sense .
while resear@@ ching the book that includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no popular additive at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the home economics recipes .
like never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - made the country &apos;s eating habits like that .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping politicians &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic delights .
particularly tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ eating attitude .
while publicly lau@@ ded the simple I@@ owa kitchen @-@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke , like the million @-@ million@@ th man of the world , to which he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and took a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was very strange to reality .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt could possibly have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called him to take an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavours by Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt made the White House produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most trou@@ bl@@ est prepared ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the land returned to its legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brick @-@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ shield attack .
after the plates at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s were cleared , they pulled out a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , adding that it was a common trick in giving humble recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved a little bit reluc@@ t@@ antly into the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set up his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even during a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives in the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , showing him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , which was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the painting quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ ra is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually only come to the surface in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks get offspring only with 150 years .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters away .
only when it arrives it acceler@@ ates the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal to a sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle , characterised by lon@@ el@@ iness , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the scientific journal &quot; Science &quot; at least one Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments the life span which represents a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed for a long time that Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks will become st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are hard to watch , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the li@@ fest@@ y@@ les of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
they measured their slow motion when they were presenting six animals with one transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers who tor@@ ment from higher water layers to the bottom .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sh@@ arks which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the deep of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cm was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens originates from the birth of the sh@@ arks and the contained proteins are no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remark@@ ably high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to be after the early 1960s , when nuclear ar@@ re@@ ars carried out larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon tests , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
in their lens nucle@@ us all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to associate the length of an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers was at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is not by chance that such methane em@@ es mainly live in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on stuck at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon acute , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources in a long life .
building ground in double pack
with topics related to construction , the Municipal Council has dealt with the most important issues in the recent session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with ease , the committee adopted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the land , par@@ cel@@ list and settlement questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications could be made on surve@@ ying , the sale of land in the residential building areas &quot; Straß@@ wal@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is no longer available to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au will appeal to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors alike .
as promised , Bau@@ will@@ s can now report to the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to consult the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to also en@@ force en@@ quiries about the establishment of further industrial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already proven there is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main therefore has the best chances of attrac@@ ting displaced people and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether bank@@ ers should continue to operate from London for financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , authorisation is sufficient in the UK so far .
these are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced that they can reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which brings together responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B Risk Committee .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg has managed to punish a large fund industry , it is also getting worse in terms of infrastructure like Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
furthermore , the town is equipped with readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main .
moreover , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is standing on No@@ .@@ 7 , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , the econom@@ ists say .
the balance of power also speaks for this : in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal expenses from hepatitis C patent disputes with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc would be entitled to a refund of legal expenses arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ l &apos;s and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , US magi@@ strate , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , claimed that Gilead is entitled to reli@@ ance on the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize with Gilead that controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained to each other and took possession of laboratory work entitled Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops backed by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ ia from the Islamic State
troops backed by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left in the city , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are now comb@@ ating the city after the exo@@ dus of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city .
they liber@@ ated more than 2,000 civilians , held as ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan shared with the D@@ KS military council Reu@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is under complete control now , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published its 2015 tax return on Friday , which resulted in a USD 10.@@ 75 million income and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton received USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ariums ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the past ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Kaiser continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri noted in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false statements and re@@ treats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , even though they are not obliged by law for this purpose .
Tr@@ ump , a New Yorker business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already om@@ itted that his refusal raises questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business forms and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday to publish his tax return in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump .
on Thursday she spoke the topic also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the past few decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that in the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday who stated that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away developed an industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here , to exchange news for their tax declar@@ ations .
buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump has &quot; sc@@ ared &quot; of the elec@@ torate and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published a tax return to 2007 .
the Clinton population now living in Ch@@ app@@ Aqua , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 Clinton &apos;s tax return showed that these only USD 100 of their income were paid as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and income were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
nature conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements in people - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ds .
the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , has strengthened its funding together with U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the World &apos;s Day devoted to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not sc@@ ared , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ lies cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust at chil@@ i powder into the air .
a breath is usually enough to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last possibility is a ship@@ yard that sho@@ ots a golden fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no Ki@@ osk@@ res@@ bau at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

however , the town council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales room on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine @-@ Bank in the near future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ lic@@ itation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media ru@@ dder after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pres@@ election , since it had called for Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels .
the country , however , was not listed between countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
searching for an explanation , the director contacted the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee stated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even bigger dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yiel@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alleg@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ laimed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not record in the pop @-@ up list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police pus@@ hes tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police rub@@ b@@ ish rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of the State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti v@@ ying against preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in shops in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the turnover rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran went up by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes off from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian delegation included some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran has reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , some of whom the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the old Persian civilization &apos;s monuments in a good state , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : drinking water inf@@ ar@@ ction in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the issuing of cash from the staff of the beverage market and then fled initially on foot and then presumably with a silver coloured VW Golf .
how much money was paid , the police did not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the assault , the perpetr@@ ators must be scanned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking lot situated opposite the car park entrance with the silver colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should report urgently to the police .

eight beautiful and happy days the children and young@@ sters of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the Children &apos;s Protection Association Nag@@ old with their car@@ egi@@ vers spent their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf near Mühl@@ acker .
the life @-@ joyful group was accommod@@ ated during the first week of school holidays in the quiet Lei@@ sure theim Hard@@ ship Show .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ azar with the visit of the string zoo .

the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
during the hot days the group was pleased at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash .
children and car@@ ers were spoiled with their own delicacies such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops was made ati@@ zed , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pilgrims to the gate of mercy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the altar boys from the mar@@ in@@ care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were dealt with together .
in order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the senior government of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage to several days .
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were examined and one finally decided for the Bischof@@ s@@ stadt Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the open gate of mercy at the Freiburg Min@@ ster .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms set themselves in the way .
in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s crosses and distributed the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b he was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster &apos;s Our Lady stands and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s Way was started from the Min@@ ster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way the min@@ is made their way to field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly to sing a song from specially assembled pilgri@@ m @-@ song .
the par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers of the local par@@ ishes were available for the overnight stays .
at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after , the stage was taken to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first some 500 meters of altitude had to be lowered and then again climbed .
the earned reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of Pil@@ gri@@ mage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg on the final stage .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the min@@ is met in the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a small imp@@ etus , God was given thanks .
at the evening mass in Münster the min@@ is hosted by the pilgri@@ m destination were welcomed by the operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were min@@ ted .
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med his home in order to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest 6th place in London , despite the arrival of Ho@@ ys in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in good time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement en@@ gen@@ dered a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner made an olymp@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord in the Quali@@ fication Round , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap he was slightly back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a great deal of the transformation going on in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all to allow Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y watched from his position as BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climbed on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord in the final round and the World Champion was defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the site of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , he admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the train .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no claim of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such a problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined in the last three months as a team .
we have so badly taken away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible that he will repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day were also born Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y next takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had argued with officers before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition that will be continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there were drama in the background , with the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ bing pen@@ alties and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks quite like the now legendary call G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
the future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy consumption
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places by workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to give any further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt uses around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry melt , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land is losing money and ris@@ king a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large Al@@ uminum melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the Tre@@ aties were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ aties have a 12 @-@ month period of notice so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects the contracts in the 17 year to contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential effects on income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecast of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already depreci@@ ated in its annual decline of $ 18@@ 7 million in the &quot; expectation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not affect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have come into force in November this year , even if there is yet another explanation why it has res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , San Antonio is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
San Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and running on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or just keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , a descri@@ p@@ tive reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an family ( except for Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n problems ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest , as they have all planned a surprise party .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed plot of nearly every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ acia brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began with certainty .
Kend@@ ra@@ Wild &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , regarding the Vog@@ ue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertisement ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited to se@@ ep pictures of the magazine before the official announcement in the last two years .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mo@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga &apos;s honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the low chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she finds herself in good society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true for J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mist@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings clas@@ hed up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but to go round on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
San J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell pictures of them on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal Health Centers assign 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary materials are reported annually by the municipal centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mean cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their seeking for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utili@@ sed , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is envis@@ aged that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the community centers of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community centers revealed that thousands of people are already rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without the aboli@@ tion of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families that go through divisions , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal way and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly raise these short@@ cuts so that people can receive the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government promised to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Camp@@ aig@@ n indic@@ ted after Staff allegedly drew weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina sent a gun to a staff while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , submitted to Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have been waiting for months for the issue to be internally regulated before it realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run in Vinc@@ ente &apos;s Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining with the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave up in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed an uph@@ eav@@ al when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - gun @-@ gun owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and appointed judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ur violence .
ordin@@ is Compl@@ aint requests C@@ laim@@ s from the Camp@@ aig@@ n for the violation of due dili@@ gence and by Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ hen@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip failed just as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
on calls from his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has previously led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l against federal elections : lose SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , substantial losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties are drawing off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the poll@@ s in Berlin .
the SPD , however , would be the strongest party in both states and would have a good chance of continuing the head of the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial among the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament .
despite a slight loss of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Green Sc@@ enes again entered the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
according to the pol@@ l of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) would only come to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it is still behind the Green Party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left , 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent before ) .
the Af@@ D was represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would , on the other hand , miss the entrance in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia communic@@ ator launched the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now range for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Office in West pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could receive a lot for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit very slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and wound on Microsoft .
today , vendors still dominate the market , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere is a daily routine for many people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
around 1.4 billion devices were sold , while Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has developed around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was just at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen is easy to use .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al procession started , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry got to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian Provi@@ ders like Samsung .
20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course .
on average , every German meanwhile looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff at the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered to be a curse and a blessing .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we spent a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were before us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expansion he@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ ating on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport as well as in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 that was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking are equal to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post where it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the coding as to its advertisements to make it difficult to identify the indication of what part of the advertisement is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way of dealing with the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o battle between the time @-@ flo@@ cking open source community and the b@@ unk@@ ers has already been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook is soon to come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how high concern indicators have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue from Facebook .
the company adverti@@ sed it on desktop PCs as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue , so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have more control of people over it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ Block &apos;s new filters would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block contents on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have instead concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to give more control into people &apos;s hands .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide transfer to Swiss Highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police told in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , wanted to kill herself , including a truck , including a truck .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them to report to them as well as any witness of the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes court d@@ etter stated to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hof@@ st@@ etter said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was said in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted after leaving a man who had killed a man lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious in the street , taking the dish .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call -- proc@@ eeded in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfectly exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere could have er@@ ased Earth @-@ like conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow turn of Venus is exposed to almost two months of the sun &apos;s day @-@ side , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions of years .
her oceans evapor@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy steps back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a low degree of co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , which it requires and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to those of the organization .
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ah , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick kept me informed today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ah said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the association to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed in each of the last two years the post @-@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference at five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ the@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike a strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes relating to wages for North Sea workers are suspended , while all the parties for a new round of discussion sit at the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the present dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop a few full @-@ day sessions over the coming weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent because of negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell dismissed thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alized its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliamentary committee , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ er understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and in which context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the formation of the planets .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other Stern@@ enh@@ aufen , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ boo@@ ze of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , built about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are turning the fastest now .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars run large amounts of star @-@ winds .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ple@@ j@@ ades &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much to complain about , how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported extensively in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rotary rates , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball star emerges
tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
following his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 , against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ day all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was chosen to become the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he acts as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar figures .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old cannot be included in the fame lobby of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so successful is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted to have taken forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , he was closed for 211 roles by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back to the south . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends once again get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench very often .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , sympathy and encour@@ agement from the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; sang the fans during the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
blur@@ red : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio cannot start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already cri@@ tically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions , these news come to the un@@ time .
in Ch@@ en the ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de had been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the lectures of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; X@@ in@@ hua cited from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , not the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news se@@ eps through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to be involved in the prohibited substance around the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B sample will also have a positive effect .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly spoke with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to take part in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the ing@@ es@@ tion , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association was prohibited from starting the entire Russian squ@@ ad except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous contracts in China also ensured violent confron@@ tations between the athletes .
so Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ lac . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in the Chinese Championships in 2014 , but only had to sit for a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ ress h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently using targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware Defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 per cent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , in part multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims readily pay@@ ed the funds required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in corporate networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they are successful there , the potential to be redeemed is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching an alar@@ ming rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months terri@@ bly fast .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files like e.g. Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als permanently .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users have the personal photo database at stake , companies are sensitive to sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage is higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the German companies reported losses in sales by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will receive their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the offen@@ ders &apos; demand in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the areas of use and contact with black@@ mail users and came to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain to their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t free @-@ of @-@ charge files for free .
and if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the job , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware @-@ kits were created by buying malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ heads are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log in one of the forums underground , buy the set of a criminal and ask another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Survey are committed to protecting Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful black@@ mail , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetr@@ ators could also set new targets on the Internet of things in the future .
at the Def@@ con h@@ acker conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little Coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of room in both the first row and the rear compartment .
the materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant , only the cockpit top drops down there .
the HR @-@ V in the storage compartment is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests available , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like the cinema seat and provide storage space that is height up to 1.@@ 24 m from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the charge height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work a little qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine specification : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision guard sometimes irrit@@ ates because when manoeu@@ v@@ ring , he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed if required .
but full connectivity is available only for top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ range equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car .
airline is not liable : fall on air passenger lift
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger lift .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued for a liability only in the case of haz@@ ards that are typical for aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline didn &apos;t have to pay compensation for the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
after their trip , sick leave only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found without doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family was severely ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of its tur@@ key vacation .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the holi@@ day@@ makers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was so defici@@ ent - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the plain@@ ti@@ ff &apos;s departure .
until then , he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of duty , such as the verdict .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among each other - belongs to the general life risk .
only 38 were left by 6@@ 91 guests .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violent acts committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have taken care of further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and determined at the same time react to acts of terrorism .
one thing is certain : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hate and division .
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when perpetr@@ ators need to leave the country faster , this will increase security and strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals by the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit size over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be under punishment .
CC@@ TV surveillance is designed to improve the distribution of weapons in such a way that , above all , the purchase of weapons on the Internet is ham@@ pered .
the last long @-@ deb@@ ated duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions , how the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear @-@ file for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything that you reject and I lean the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green CEO Sim@@ one Peter repro@@ ached the Minister of being able to simulate action and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorism p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ders said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nav@@ al pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of right to stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this shall change : the legal dispute shall be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic every night in traffic on the ambient road when they cross the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer @-@ Strasse and the Wes@@ er Straße , the road construction will be extended by 700 meters .
mot@@ orists can then cycle straight from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic gains early on , whereby the overall flow of the traffic on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the Administr@@ ative District of Mu@@ enster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return con@@ ges@@ tion goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ an way and sometimes beyond .
the bottom is the needle @-@ cave on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is only lowered by one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be disman@@ tled more than three @-@ quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accomo@@ date heavy duty traffic in two lanes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected half @-@ day traffic jam will last , the responsible state company cannot say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the right @-@ hand bend , the state company consciously chose the traffic weaker time during the school holidays because it had to be reck@@ oned with disabilities .
the traffic is passed on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Offers for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theatre are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome children the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project .
most of the young people of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , according to the press release of the young theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg and the Young Theatre will work together as part of a music theatre project in the coming season .
from October to December , you@@ ths should be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music , with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language distribution are planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ shooting @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany a grain through the bill on Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad due to clouds and rain , to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star schu@@ ppen are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are among the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep well before the alarm bells .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , it is possible to deal with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent perceive their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep disturbances manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Association for Sle@@ eping Rec@@ og@@ nition and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands pro@@ vision@@ ally , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , a dor@@ man@@ t and sleep @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance .
just staying asleep many people perceive as un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
not in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is the expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is especially common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ hid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
for example , if someone has a sli@@ pped disc , every two to three hours w@@ akes up and possibly starts to talk about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , tell We@@ ago .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is tired , tired , not slept , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to allevi@@ ate sleep problems it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is hardly any low @-@ level sleeping medicine in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , when sleeping problems , one should contact the GP at first , at the head of the event .
this can clarify if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the lab , and what happens ?
for examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of sleep@@ iness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare yourself for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the ti@@ ling you go to bed at the normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose frame , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping space .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few screws on which you can apply for a better sleep .
wei@@ ghting counts : regular sleep and standing times , not lying too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to all .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first took gold at the world champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected his former ex @-@ team@@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € premium and a jungle King 15@@ 0,000 € , no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pumping system in swimming sports is bad , whereas the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A for a certain time before World Cup / OS , you must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who now runs an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de det@@ ained by Bag@@ gage
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
the police officers of Düsseldorf &apos;s police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 @-@ 61 on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage .
at 21.@@ 30 hrs civilian officials in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police officers from past theft off@@ ences .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July , and they had worked together in a collaborative , working and professional manner .
the specialists of the crime comm@@ iss@@ ariat of 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves who had entered Germany especially for crimes committed to Germany .
in total , they carried over 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain doesn &apos;t seem like that at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a newly @-@ painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house , someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , is already being built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartment rentals will be built by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , are illustrated in the last few weeks , however , preferably with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police for three weeks , according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , blocked sections of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown owner of the house .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk in front of Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many local residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are mostly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects they share the concern of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
the dig@@ ging of the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between occup@@ iers and their neighbours does not exist so clearly .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today , in comparison to the rest of the city , has a low average income and high poverty risk .
house occup@@ ations and the native housing projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the proximity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was placed under a heavy police command in a real street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and ball@@ ers from all over the world : with them residents from the GDR times and former home@@ owners are now sharing their neighbourhood .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on raised windows or freshly painted facades thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Left @-@ Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes make property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the famous burning cars also don &apos;t give it any longer directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here people help each other , live together on the streets and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has consciously moved into the streets of Riga - and remained .
that &apos;s why it was also so important that the local residents get their streets back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all of them suddenly claimed the oh@@ alit@@ arian sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : with fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building gaps that are displac@@ ing the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are actually con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here people who are not so well beha@@ ved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can we do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who anno@@ y themselves about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene belong to the Kie@@ z .
those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area , can complain badly about noise there .
all persons presented with the first name have asked to not be named with their real name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er of Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working groups of refugees , administration , authorities and who else is still involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group points to the fact that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ghty wo@@ ollen @-@ sow , which has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking but rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , we@@ aving a ru@@ di@@ ous lust @-@ milk @-@ sow .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine concluded that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ our@@ able and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers will be available in Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the installation .
you will have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land parliament to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , administration does not find private apartments .
so far it doesn &apos;t work , so you &apos;re dependent on private homes , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , communal dwell@@ ings need to be intim@@ id@@ ated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be erected in Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with dwell@@ ings it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , training centres , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine Client reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help car@@ et@@ akers perform char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer .
people should develop a sense of belonging .
so there are offers like sport , contact with local people and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
thus , administration and honorary members also jump here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can brid@@ le the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
whoever wants to develop the feeling at some point , can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problems , says the customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins completely dis@@ cour@@ aged them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine Client says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
in other words , the main and honorary posts have to look out for activities locally and in the region .
in the background , they have always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is hes@@ it@@ ant .
it is actually unfair to spot them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine Client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
these are currently about 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
