<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variation with a ride on the beach with some colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>

<seg id="11">He had his family run over the ALRV plant, on a horse he did not even boar for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the context of a small gala, the man from Germany handed over the golden sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likeable sportsman does not lack any distinctions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Rlaurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already rebuked him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Comparing Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trading agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton underlie a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "trump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to control the economy and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will go back to massive regulation, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "on the other hand, Clinton says:" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has to open disadvantaged chances and needs money for it." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In that need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost equal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party-internal discussions on trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining back in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, it wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewables with its investment programme:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them don't want to isolate the US from international trade, but just want to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, like Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to get up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the large discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more in favour of the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, is standing up to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles appeared devilishly and hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly about his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was rage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousin is difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media made a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious charges were the accusations from senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But St. Petersburg's official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends that he can get after he has been dismissed by almost his ministry last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated attacks against Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives as well.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports were allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West, as its response to the attempted takeover of power is regarded as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the persistent resentment on the snail stamp of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is piped to benefit from the cool sentiment and lessen the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus for ensuring that after the attempted coup d "état he called for support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that have been rejected and badly treated by the West and are now fading away.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents of the press conference said that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least once again talk to each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov, Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's closest trust for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it reads that without stating grounds, Putin ordered the release Ivanovs of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was an Ivanovs deputy since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later became the log boss and chief of staff of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "on his appointment he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mystical.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidante and works as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once was touted as a potential president, at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy, met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - to entrust the aining post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been President of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he named Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ivanov once believed that after Putin's second term of office, President of Russia could become President of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "" "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 bevel cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economic Affairs, Keith Brown, visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "That is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure is a trend-setting high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the gap to the north or the north.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern extension bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side, they were only a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time watching screens has been bemoaned by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture dropped the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been shifted by the massive demand that overloads the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person puts back every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health which people want to take" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "being active every day" "" "hit deaf ears, because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who is doing sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors to make them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also crustaceans who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's to be done?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though Smartphone Apps like Fitbit could track our activity in the past, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will leave with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activism in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all the way.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now also Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast announced on Thursday for the multi-campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" -team Kameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the floating beam during the individual campaign of women in gymnastics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has won over the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescue from her said she is "the best gymnast that I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected her last examination in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugged after winning gold and silver in the single-campaign inale of women in gymnastics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted, during their long journey to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, in which Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition competition, a winning series that will continue as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was easy through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and ground floor - in which Biles holds the world title.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and sat on the floor with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her Endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue Eyeliner than the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old team of men, called" "" "Oma" "", "had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise she threw down kisses to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "it is happening in a residential area in front of a house," "" "Howard Johnson shared with CBS, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month." ""</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heavy rainfall, flooding gives rise to bailouts in Louisiana, Mississippi</seg>
<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi River flooded their banks and threatened with large flooding after extreme rainfalls, the National weather service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that government officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and were already on the move to the municipalities concerned.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for flood cars, boats and sandbags were increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sand bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flooding warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service provided that an additional 3 to 5 inch rain could drop in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburb opposite Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as these flows through the trodden rivers only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfav, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still drained people from flood waters in the areas of Amite and Wilkinson south-west of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued by Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, greatly heightens overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed and floated in," "" "Hansford said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife said Hansford had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that the emergency helpers had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flooding had" "" "spread quickly" "" "as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation procedures into account." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer in the vicinity of Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13,75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil was considerably balanced by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and classes in five districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary web-traveller reported that there were 200 flooded houses in Tangipahoa.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches which now both were flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that were rinsed by the flood.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuates.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "as soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," "" "he said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present in the gymnastics event in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls from other skin colours.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicon is round, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, yet masterful Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual campaign for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't look like classes across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same way as Aly and Madison to get into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are a costlier sport and gymnasts are first and foremost in private gyms maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are located in affluent suburbs, which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts get their whole training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained their athletes since they started their gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to provide a more affordable and easy-to-access exercise training to the communities of n innumerable young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my TurnstiFoundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that invites thousands of young girls to get interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team gold and thank you for having so many young girls with backgrounds in order to start their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance physicians who voted in favour of a vote rejected him.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA committee for assistance doctors announced last night in a message with: "resident doctors have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current crisis of the workforce and it will be used to address all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">In only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time runs out.</seg>

<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness culture leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year for the dismissal of a government report due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a crushing government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and communal government, which is now an antagonism king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up barriers outside of elective cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should carry out an identification card in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter has to name only his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply distant ink to a person's finger if they give up their vote in order to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblower should get more protection, Sir Eric says.</seg>
<seg id="10">It requires that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or workgroups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this serves not only against electoral fraud, but is also meant to protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's Choice Voucher in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special local court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman was to be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman allegedly perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have" "" "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which a person chooses to vote as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of deception throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed particularly alarming on the fraudulent letter of postal voting - in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading out clues to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elders, especially communities with a Pakistani or banga background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there have been concerns that... state institutions have ignorantly ignored such behaviour due to" "" "politically correct" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "Sir Eric said fifty recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists process briefing documents to" "" "reap" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The report considered by Theresa May also requires harder registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for migration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removeable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on proposals for an automatic postal choice.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists manipulate complete letters and envelopes of letterheads.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the power to set up lockouts around electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">The amendment made it easier to prosecute the prosecution for intimidation according to the People Act of 1983 (Legislative Decree 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">No photography in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the ballot stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensifying the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters go to the ballot alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "the election tribunal has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "he also criticises the ineffective" "" "checkups" "" "of the electoral departments of the town halls." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "Sir Eric said:" "" "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright cheered for a guide his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller subjected his immune system and dignity to a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his train to a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a draw toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before settling each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of replacing the rinsing button of a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, more bad bacteria are in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known for testing the resistance of his gut by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to rinsing buttons of toilets, the task posed its immune system definitely to a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test painting showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse, after their luminous luminance was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here anything here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "validation Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things with which it was easier to get Ian, to check them out and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out by the year 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Parliament of Schwerin has already decided at the beginning of the year, which will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays 2021.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid as so far it does not work: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the freedom fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country are on the way to Usedom, Rügen, Hiddensee and are not locals.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays helpers, posters hang up, inflating balloons, distributing flyers and counting voices in the end, only laboriously.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the last day of the election and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign shortly before the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will be exciting, how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end coalitionalism.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and heads of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, is seen from his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the countryside, spreads roses and chatters a little with the people, just as his legendary word predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, counseling has got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel the blame for the bloom of AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create that" "" "accelerated the rise of the right wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale environments; Merkel's Federal Chancellor is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is a shame even to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Northeast-CDU largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions on marketplaces and shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, said Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has realised that on the land you will crumble the base so that it must be very strict again to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You find it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU election warrior Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing: "you have to go where it hurts, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, any birthday celebration must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just below the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD won a clear victory at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, the small party with seven percent in polls, are likely to make the leap into parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of their vacations and mostly lay their election campaign on the internet.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being rehabilitated.</seg>

<seg id="8">The receipt will also be commended to those responsible for the construction works, such as when it comes to setting up residence trips.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site emigrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was reversed and that the connection to Rottenburg exists again, the traffic situation within the place has eased.</seg>

<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks paraded in residential areas.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to revenue losses in them makes everyone look through.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants were "hit hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to release half of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President-president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where so much more generously handled has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business is settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't approach it, it's also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family-clientele comes back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises associated with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner sees the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged loving slabs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before heading to the comment section, in order to sow it under the pseudonym non-Allegra Men's Middle Ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the recuemergence of sound plates is not attributable to a booming in Millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife-Nostalgie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by amateur collectors - it has an emotional significance: older people of the record retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and studded wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something bad about it: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho slowly forfeits its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such deals and try to estimate their age and mood by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and bought new items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records tend to be more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "from the conversations I have led, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the board revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a store like Fonica to see record stores offering a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, of objects that evoke happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get into mind.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flutes from a stack of plates." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month had not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smother through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a trophy aspect of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came here just recently and said," "" "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly come into it.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the" "" "Fopp," "" "which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a lower audience than I am going into." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists that make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizer- and sexthemed pop instead of experimental jazz drumming from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but the psychic traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of the plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes window bumps rather than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not earn much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I appear to give the appearance of pants for pants, I watch a group of young girls grouping around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and online forums is untaken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with strolling through disks of Berwick Street and the sheets through boards, while avoiding the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who stands above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 makeshift shops in which people sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be pulled down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, and that would have a fire and health risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary businesses and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Lille court ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional trading operations, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than to feed people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the fall-down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is commonly used and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids Café.</seg>

<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, on accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary flash for compliance with speed limit.</seg>

<seg id="6">Reinforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement mode, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as driveways according to time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-year-long rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they hit the Dee Stadium in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line-up and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost each game at the Adelaide Sevilla under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only get one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks to bounce off GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hassle-free tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but Fiji has only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Athlete Jasa Veremalua went down a touchdown in the right corner and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa has added a new one since the reunion and there was still more than one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou competed by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and rushed to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still gutted.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB took fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian void... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua went through Tuisova after a brilliant gameplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the southern seater, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whiff sounds, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked out crushing in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier this day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown got the Boks in the first half forwards, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate below the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was omnipresent when they rowed to the second Olympic champion in the two-wheeler without a control woman, the first women in the history of British Sports, who laid such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter undefeated use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes, gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not completely reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the trainer, who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>

<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if this was the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Helen called" "" "stay in the process, stay in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something special.</seg>
<seg id="33">Today we didn't want fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to conceive that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was a member of the kennel for 31 years, 28 years of age as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water sport association of the Veitensteingruppe with its headquarters in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the congregations of the church of Kirchberg, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are available for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current president, Breitbrunn mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller set up as a water gover in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Board of Directors in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergencies on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), purchase of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high container (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial innovations of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no standstill and I have repeatedly added innovations because water is water and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatio, she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose-association downright as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for the reduction of nitrate in front of the water forum of Unterfranken district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller on his part praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water gover and he was a faithful crap.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">He described the well-construction and re-structuring of the coercion-association as highlights from his point of view.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the tubing in the high container at the church louder on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work through the whole night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">The supply of Neubrunn was also possible only because one filled the high container from Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water purge association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the sector of green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the renewable energy situation in the existing systems for the so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday issue).</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a draft agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissar Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced are an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on self-electricity production.</seg>

<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat eased.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand, economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's study she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing inspires me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German Retirement division.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors may socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">In doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as they are in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people is awakening many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-denied people are devising long past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special power is required for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrating on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially the elderly, who live alone, do not only concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who listens when a sound goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, Senior Citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, say Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="4">Other superior athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of doping is still the headlines at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who complained about his starting right after a Doping lock, was amputated mercilessly at her start (100 meters of chest) and rested.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was a bizarre scene: with a smiles she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When she realised that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a cheering storm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are many other sportsmen who go to the start despite the Doping past at the Rio Olympics in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatline (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel / USA): the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was locked already twice for doping (2001 and 2006 until 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">The Olympic champion of 2004 and ex-world champion has been even faster than before; it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m-season / Jamaika): the two-time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six-month lock in 2010 after having been proven to take the painkiller with Oxycodon.</seg>

<seg id="22">Ivan Tichon (Hammerreproach, Belarus): hardly any athlete was subsequently recognised as many medals.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus, Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later, after having found testosterone doping.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the 40-year-old had to give Olympics silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship due to testosterone abuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was also recognized as the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games based on a verdict of the International Sports Court CAS.</seg>

<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">The detonation in the vicinity of the bathing beach of Patong, popular with vacationers, was violated by a taxi driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani, at the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>

<seg id="18">It is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not associated with the Islamist insurrection movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities have received secret references in the past few days on imminent attacks in the south of the country - though they were not informed about the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed its officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement of economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, considers itself to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not been able to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Rio de Janeiro summer games.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia moaned so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte became viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his pre-race with a reset of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty character that drew the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24 year old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more well known in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen walk in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something else.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of 1 October 2016, the charges per cubic metre of effluent will be 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3,44; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget, Kulmbach district office has established that undercover works for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Manager Herbert Schmidt explained to the body, a new calculation of fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overlapping or undercover from the previous calculation period will also be offset.</seg>
<seg id="10">In all three sewerage facilities, Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with relatively small facilities with a very low sanitation, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age of refurbishment and repair, the previous calculation period of all three plants did not last considerably due to their age of refurbishment and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt referred to the fact that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewage plant Azendorf due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pump plant Welschahl, the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the pond sewage plant Lopp, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation slot had to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low wastewater treatment in the three plants, the expenses for operation and subsistence were "fully exploited."</seg>
<seg id="20">In the past 20 years, Schmidt, the market town of large entertainment costs, continued to be spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the long run, as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water-association could not be extended because it is a deficit disorder.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian cartoon criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's not sensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be a painting from Roy Lichtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unverified, self-winding tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All absences arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of promoting black face or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it proposed to some users a filter that gave them slit-eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow vision."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies showed a greater problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat informed that it had turned the feature off.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was conceived as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely used on the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and barren."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very conflicting Asian cartoon and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellowness has been dragged into the outgoing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older antagonists - could be more likely to assume sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting to a user, "so it is much more difficult for such things to stay unnoticed than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes racist-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the adjustment practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the big part of white, just male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat leaned to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company has recently hired a HR officer, concentrating on subordinate population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, on the other hand, said that she will shut down her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence gathering information to sign an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed on site, a report of the congress was announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Preliminary Report, created by a Republican Task Force of Republican members of the Army Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Missile Commites, reported a great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret services analysts who reported how superiors changed their appreciation to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically nodded by high-ranking Centcom cartographers, regularly drawn a positive image of US efforts against terrorism when the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive than analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, noted." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the Centcom range up to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed constant problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications suggesting that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, opinions and statements submitted to Congress were clearly more positive than the facts" "" "reported the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossad could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into their lives after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report, which was published on Thursday, will be completed by more detailed findings while investigations are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly restricted process for creating post-intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest-level democrat in the committee, member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "praised morals among analysts and gave" "" "moderately little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts regarding a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "preliminary results of the proceedings of the congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's General Inspector, which was recorded after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, there was a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also insisted that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful campaign of air under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "however, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a written document about how the then government under George W. Bush did not foresee only a small occupation force in Iraq and left little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current media coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker noted that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom damaliger Commandlshaber, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of its overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American Feldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is what she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, as always the game may start on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed on the last of 12 squares during the last London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey bat in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became National Champion of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torragen in the first half of the game with a back hand from close-up.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into play without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro's events feel steadily and inescapable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is passed from the wristband protecting to the gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leoverly or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by Sponsors and well-being TV ads, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic style.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade, the sports that are not generally accepted are: air pistol, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swim and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I think I should make arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charms of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on the trampoline is an olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it was so sparse the last 16 years that many of whom I had questioned did not know that it is at all an olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian ones for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hats and ointages) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic program, they are rated according to the performance, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medalists hope to go further, faster, up and down in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall, but also a further highlight in the TV transmission: the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted pursuit is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a viewer into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatiguing when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space of this.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she collides, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant annulment of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by getting the male athlete and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US-Turner recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia really going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests erupted against the government and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen were firing and killing dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests that are likely to be from the last or earlier of this year show how security men beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to turn a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now calls for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led to repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, while dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options other than protest, it breaks off," "" "said Sejm Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold on the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea rise; a struggle for this jagged, disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogade, which were forced more or less in recent years, could use the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of conceiving it under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death on an unpublished disease in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Africa, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protest against elections which, according to analysts, were apparently sucked by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal ignorance of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked Gondar, an amharian town, managed by Tigray, and hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although she recently informed her that she has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr. Abdi," "" "is a very thin net migration." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign by angling that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communications capabilities of the Republicans' presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligible with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its comrades who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to have to explain statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump posted back on the claim on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to point out, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump to weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prasselt down to Mr. Trump while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the sake of falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had a strong criticism of himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I thought it's sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to reshape as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction falls out." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has received an even more corrosive tone, as his surveys have continued to decline." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a major lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he emphasises the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocatively his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent princes, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them Hindusts, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by setting it aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania last Friday, Mr. Trump carried on his attacks on the media and accused them of retreating each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trumps's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the Presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once beyond the price of the market, café is returning to Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a nice cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served excellent coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were crowded out of Bedford Avenue store.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie shop, replaced by Verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people felt it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excepted and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalised Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing member of the old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started to work at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same bulbs from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnisings like capers and saute onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers have also been displaced by Williamsburg prizes," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Rebecca Oliveira has been such a customer recently on a Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in the past and regularly visited the verb.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drinking for a while, she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebra is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually only come to the surface in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks get offspring only with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters away.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives it accelerates the five-metre-long animal to a satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, characterised by loneliness, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the scientific journal "Science" at least one Grönlandshark, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness" "", "Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments the life span which represents a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist assumed for a long time that Greenland-sharks will become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are hard to watch, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyles of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion when they were presenting six animals with one transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadavers who torment from higher water layers to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sharks which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the deep of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 cm was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens originates from the birth of the sharks and the contained proteins are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkably high carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to be after the early 1960s, when nuclear arrears carried out larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens nucleus all larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to associate the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not by chance that such methane emes mainly live in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon stuck at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon acute, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "so, a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," "" "explains the evolutionist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all the registrants in two years, the senior government of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage to several days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages were examined and one finally decided for the Bischofsstadt Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the open gate of mercy at the Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruene, and Haigerloch, and holy rooms set themselves in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim's crosses and distributed the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb he was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster's Our Lady stands and so the Pilgrim's Way was started from the Minster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>

<seg id="15">The earned reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the Jumping and made the legend proud when he stormed his home in order to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest 6th place in London, despite the arrival of Hoys in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in good time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement engendered a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner made an olymparecord in the Qualification Round, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap he was slightly back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a great deal of the transformation going on in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all to allow Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," "" "It's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olymparecord in the final round and the World Champion was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the site of Kennys and Hoys, he admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no claim of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such a problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have so badly taken away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is possible that he will repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sports; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny next takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had argued with officers before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition that will be continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record period in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There were drama in the background, with the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing penalties and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks quite like the now legendary call GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium meltdown from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces by workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to give any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt uses around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry melt, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large Aluminum melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the Treaties were so-called" "" "collateral transactions" "" "that should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The Treaties have a 12-month period of notice so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL expects the contracts in the 17 year to contribute to revenues," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on income on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecast of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that the value of the contracts had already depreciated in its annual decline of $187 million in the "expectation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "ability Alcoas... to operate the melt" "" "or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "did not affect." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have come into force in November this year, even if there is yet another explanation why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts of electricity per year to consume around 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the stereotyped plot of nearly every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacacia brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashian began with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">KendraWild's big sister Kim likes her, regarding the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were 615 pages of advertisement).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is eagerly awaited to seep pictures of the magazine before the official announcement in the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>

<seg id="15">"" "but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "" "breakthrough model" "" "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she finds herself in good society." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who are in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>

<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings clashed up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to go round on the Missmut seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">San Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere could have erased Earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation the slow turn of Venus is exposed to almost two months of the sun's day-side," "" "explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen withdrew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other Sternenhaufen, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, built about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are turning the fastest now.</seg>

<seg id="2">Blurred: due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio cannot start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle course in Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions, these news come to the untime.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen the uretic hydrochlorothiazide had been proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sport Court (CAS) confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterflies, just about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the lectures of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigation" "", "Xinhua cited from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sport Tribunal CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, not the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news seeps through the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be food supplements," "" "said the athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said to be involved in the prohibited substance around the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B sample will also have a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov promptly spoke with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation are not allowed to take part in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="23">Both deny the ingestion, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, the Danekova case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association was prohibited from starting the entire Russian squad except for systematic doping, even the Läufernation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the previous contracts in China also ensured violent confrontations between the athletes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide compress hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently using targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware Defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 per cent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, in part multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily payed the funds required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "the perpetrators specialize in their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate networks." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be redeemed is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching an alarming rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months terribly fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on the victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files like e.g. Word-, Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database at stake, companies are sensitive to sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the German companies reported losses in sales by ransomware, 13 percent had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will receive their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the offenders' demand in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the areas of use and contact with blackmail users and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up accessible support websites or decrypt free-of-charge files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the job, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus supplier Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware-kits were created by buying malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackheads are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums underground, buy the set of a criminal and ask another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes Survey are committed to protecting Ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful blackmail, the perpetrators are threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "declares Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also set new targets on the Internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the 1,60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of room in both the first row and the rear compartment.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top drops down there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V in the storage compartment is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like the cinema seat and provide storage space that is height up to 1.24 m from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the charge height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine specification: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort." ""</seg>

<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision guard sometimes irritates because when manoeuvring, he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is available only for top-of-the-range equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep well before the alarm bells.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, it is possible to deal with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent perceive their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disturbances manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Association for Sleeping Recognition and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands provisionally, however, is the insomnia, that is, a dormant and sleep-disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just staying asleep many people perceive as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disorder is the expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is especially common in case of depression," "" "says Wehid." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if someone has a slipped disc, every two to three hours wakes up and possibly starts to talk about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, tell Weago.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is tired, tired, not slept, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep problems it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any low-level sleeping medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, when sleeping problems, one should contact the GP at first, at the head of the event.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of sleepiness, sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare yourself for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the tiling you go to bed at the normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose frame, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping space.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few screws on which you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weighting counts: regular sleep and standing times, not lying too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive to all.</seg>

<seg id="1">What the jungle camp has with missing medals in swimming</seg>
<seg id="2">The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he first took gold at the world championships in Doha and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former DSV-Athlete Markus Deibler has now protected his former ex-teammates via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 €premium and a jungle King 150,000 €, no one should be surprised about missing medals," "" "the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The pumping system in swimming sports is bad, whereas the doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the topic of doping or even operate it." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't say that the controls should be stopped here," "" "he explained." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how you should keep it with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "if you cannot control WADA / FINA for a certain time before World Cup / OS, you must not take part," "" "says the election-hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlor." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">The police officers of Düsseldorf's police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50-61 on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and baggage.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 hrs civilian officials in the area of the Dusseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police officers from past theft offences.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July, and they had worked together in a collaborative, working and professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the crime commissariat of 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thieves who had entered Germany especially for crimes committed to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they carried over 15,000 Euros in total.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like that at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one goes along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a newly-painted kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "on the facade of a grey house, someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartment rentals will be built by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are illustrated in the last few weeks, however, preferably with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22 the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling the police for three weeks, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked sections of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown owner of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew from the rejoicing of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mostly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects they share the concern of increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from vandalism on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The digging of the Berlin inner senator and the police between occupiers and their neighbours does not exist so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today, in comparison to the rest of the city, has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">House occupations and the native housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the proximity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was placed under a heavy police command in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and ballers from all over the world: with them residents from the GDR times and former homeowners are now sharing their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on raised windows or freshly painted facades thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words" "" "Left-Autonomous Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes make property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "as for violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars also don't give it any longer directly in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here people help each other, live together on the streets and get more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has consciously moved into the streets of Riga - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was also so important that the local residents get their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all of them suddenly claimed the ohalitarian sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: with faceless newbuildings in former building gaps that are displacing the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are actually condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here people who are not so well behaved," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can we do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who annoy themselves about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belong to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub area, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with the first name have asked to not be named with their real name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner of Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working groups of refugees, administration, authorities and who else is still involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer of the working group points to the fact that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eighty woollen-sow, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking but rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, weaving a rudious lust-milk-sow.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "Regine concluded that Annika Deuschle supports honourable and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers will be available in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the installation.</seg>
<seg id="19">You will have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Land parliament to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it doesn't work, so you're dependent on private homes, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communal dwellings need to be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be erected in Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with dwellings it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm residence, there are internships, training centres, training centres, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "Regine Client reports." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help caretakers perform charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sport, contact with local people and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus, administration and honorary members also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridle the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever wants to develop the feeling at some point, can't help in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems, says the customer honestly, "people with whom nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine client says quite clearly," "" "what some naïve might call." "" "a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins completely discouraged them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "Regine Client says." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">In other words, the main and honorary posts have to look out for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they have always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is hesitant.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to spot them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Client also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
