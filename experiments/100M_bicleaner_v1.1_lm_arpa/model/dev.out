Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
in the meeting , however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critic@@ ising Israel &apos;s continuing housing construction and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal promoted by Obama , the Iranian nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship of the two .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not agreed with Obama , a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel was rejected .
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told him with a somewhat irrit@@ ated voice from the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I am sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who lec@@ tured in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office , according to the police .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff listened to the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had done the fatal emergency call at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police had en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time some tendencies were too problematic .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to so@@ lic@@ it for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trace when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long@@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up both on a summer @-@ year market three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he held Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss night in the night 5 September for the last time , after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and j@@ oked each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the watch , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that Lamb had made an emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb had claimed Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give a chance to work for more hours at his employees and seasonal workers .
the company said it plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . during Christmas 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is drawing closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to furnis@@ h shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated crow@@ ning and an arm length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had a premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of Ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they proved in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and start to let their dollar flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the Immobilien @-@ Mog@@ ul positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa announced last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they &apos;d be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their swe@@ eping hat@@ s , Republi@@ can voters hold tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb &apos;s Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters visit Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l from C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half the voters who support tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their voices .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say to never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse led to 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the new orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , there will seem to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new levels .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are mad at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; fer@@ o@@ cious . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view of the North Sea resort .
in the street , a square meter of a house roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows where specific layers cost one square meter the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter .
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is definitely not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double Tor@@ cher in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e presented a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in FC Bayern in the witch @-@ chair of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol matches ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
Müller won the Champions League for his 28 matches in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership . Roberto , who was a flan@@ k remembered by the World Champion , won the Champions League to lead the Bavarian leadership .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m ahead of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea , not to shine .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the King &apos;s class , including some famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often in@@ ventive with their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by shifting to the left on the left hand Douglas Costa , which seldom came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper part of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best occasions in half one .
first of all , as Olympic Stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pole of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set up the needle .
but he was reli@@ eved of Manuel Neu@@ er .
so about when he ste@@ ered a shot from Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ chain link with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an to the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
in front of the game there was a crash in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ bled Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study .
the good news : in the event of ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this eman@@ ates from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ ders higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes for tooth failure include tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Dr. Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , said director H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and leads to good dental health up to the age of old according to our findings .
in Germany more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking lowers the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study reveals the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter rem@@ n@@ ants from the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings , said Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the start of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as a specialist department for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found five .
from text documents it was already known that in the place of the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves , which belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the train station in the gh@@ ost lanes , the Federal Police asked the people for assistance .
on the early morning of Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm , the woman from the railway station at the end of the platform crossed the track and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , it has borne he@@ avi@@ est injuries according to the Federal Police .
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by rescue forces .
over the reason of the noc@@ tur@@ nal Equ@@ al crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the investig@@ ative officials .
the incident might have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
residents or p@@ asser@@ s by Lin@@ der@@ ner train , brick bakery , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question .

EU Commission adop@@ ts new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the resolution of the dispute over the TT@@ IP planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings show con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgments .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators , a possibility of obj@@ ection to their judgments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there could then also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) required mainly by major corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , on which companies can impose damages on tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act referred to the Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Federal State Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the legal possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , called it .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart that the frigh@@ tened folk singer recorded the picturesque US State Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of different places he always records on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and delicate arranged songs .
where they emerged and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative ma@@ d@@ man .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs , harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can drift into great opul@@ ent drift at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in succession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens can be reduced here .

one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece appeared in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to highly productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively of electronic sales . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited since his election .
the new Labour president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n aims to make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ ture and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some meetings to let her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour president &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several Tit@@ els@@ grund stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported it as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour , namely Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour MPs set out to remove all the idea of a constra@@ int overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is T@@ ory boss , across the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy approach says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ ture is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subjected to both &quot; perc@@ ussions &quot; and the quar@@ rels with resistance and instead concentr@@ ates on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers will be represented when he doesn &apos;t take part , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also talked to the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the issue .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch Theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted he failed .
as it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated growth in wages in the United Kingdom
the pound so@@ ared up according to data , which indicate an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and ear@@ marked estimates at the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 compared to the euro .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index has increased by 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over of the Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were up to 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ through a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his assessment for the company rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchasing power in the bags of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin

the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .

like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
but since 7 am the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Ben@@ ding Construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster hangs in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs the day exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in half a year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a should sit in the tenth class in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot;
obligation to school ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
even Bie@@ ber do not .
he has already taken care of it anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the supermarket he cas@@ c@@ aded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company , flus@@ hing many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the window pane .
he is supposed to have captured more than 100 million .
some say that hyp@@ e g@@ inge is too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the USA and Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; on No@@ .1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he is doing so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Leban@@ ese to potato twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
both - namely in the potato twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ isi owners have developed Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes rather than D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen accidentally on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop , a barbecue is spinning , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leban@@ ese has now submitted the idea to the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Camp@@ aig@@ n Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di parade in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a Camp@@ aig@@ n Camp@@ aig@@ n to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump aboard , with brands such as ice manufacturers S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store owners who sell dis@@ approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investment strategy day .
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia constitute almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will snap around five percent of the food market in these two states after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ employed retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million in revenue per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase sales in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests over $ 150 million to equ@@ alize sale prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programmes are to be increased to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ gio and ear@@ ns praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the not@@ orious exploration of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualification round in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ted : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have had Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kr@@ amp@@ f s@@ worn out a potential US Open @-@ win of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m rather en@@ vious about is the fact that after my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little stri@@ pped in the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too tightly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick was very quick to climb up to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency situation and adopted the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to illeg@@ ally get into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ul@@ ating in a n@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ visi@@ oning police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a Special Summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a cour@@ a@@ geous action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to under@@ lined that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison funds were deployed during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia for a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days long .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that the authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are bl@@ amed for off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to go into it .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connecting Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s edge hal@@ ved before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he can@@ did@@ ly candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the election .
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders generated some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and women , but these projections have decreased .
their support in the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton , however , has a big lead in the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the local elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled above all by her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement on how to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate will also be cited .
as the Vice President sheds a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the pre @-@ elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
if Bi@@ den doesn &apos;t decide to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s edge increases from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped out of 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the last month , no single Democ@@ rat candidate or potential candidate for this election will be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demo@@ cra@@ cies or potential candidates provide good results with some important features of voters in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic constitu@@ ents has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continue to be placed as Minister for Foreign Affairs during the term of office , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion was wor@@ sen@@ ing her .
there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views from Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters throughout the country also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks in leadership .
the six tested candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in hon@@ esty .
a majority see S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many do not have an opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the first @-@ term elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near Donald Tr@@ ump on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is eliminated by the two candidates , and others lose a dramatic stop .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell in the lowest , with 10 % support last month at now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son increases in surveys - with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
swimming temperatures , on the other hand , still offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood stressed with the death of a Bar@@ uch college new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died in a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people are filed .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , informed the police .
officials said that he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood on the basis of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sh@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning on his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been inflic@@ ted with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for schi@@ ed@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned it , we will also be accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local community .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase in interest comes , and the house is going to sink , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement might have been exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that net income returns 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , in the past 35 years , the market is usually on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to an increase in interest , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increases cycle and the return on it begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate increases since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP to 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question as to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants agreed to raise the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week ending on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increases cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put forward after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for shares if they change their strategic course .
loans seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase @-@ cycle , the bond@@ men drop immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has expanded and the volati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet achieved an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity among their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars .
savers could see gains due to higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the station because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I think it &apos;s really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that hard work had to be made to engage the public when it did this in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports for this purpose under fire to kick off commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; produced in a special BBC mode &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time a series of entertainment starts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the issues
for over a decade virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth will decrease .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for post @-@ las@@ ci@@ ating revenues .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a bit more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are supported by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial of Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia sub@@ mits the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group to the load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee collap@@ sed .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to get their respect , when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession proc@@ eeded at the Holy Place , where only a few days ago a crane craw@@ led through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured a sanc@@ tion .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great central mos@@ que Mek@@ kas were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have left the crane of the crane when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not tell this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was prohibited foreign travel .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which took place later this month , assembled .
the bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ opped the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the wre@@ ck of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ vals ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe have risen
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that target professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European craftsmen who perform works in their homes
if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully dealing with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you are now apparently a minority .
because the British are increasingly occup@@ ying skilled workers to conduct DIY jobs in their homes , such as the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
as a result , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which will focus on craftsmen and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the store are hit by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate in men .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that carry more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group owed the costs of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up to 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball @-@ Viz@@ c@@ eist@@ ers A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ab@@ dic@@ ation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been indic@@ ted for official abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted in May by this alleg@@ ation .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ end@@ ants used funds of association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
he dealt with around 400@@ ,000 euros for the damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also charged with financial difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was divided by the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
in the event of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence showed that at no time the association had ar@@ isen an asset .
the sports officials had calculated only expense compensation and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( about 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we continue or close the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants in the B@@ read @-@ based Audi@@ tor of the Financial Office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with : you can freely manage the money , it must not be made any debts .
in the case of appropriate financial success , the withdrawal of the expense allowance has been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
that is why I paid a portion of the allowance for years later , namely , since 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed bookings appeared , the ex @-@ chairman explained the events .
the accounts and spar@@ es managed the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial statements , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account against the official abuse of official abuse .
these were appropri@@ ations , declared the def@@ end@@ ants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor called into the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this bank transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims for claims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge and At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With whom are you all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal counsel ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged 1,000 euros per month on di@@ ets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants could not present accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer preserved after an operation , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all the hang@@ ings were made in cash , and he said in his statement from his place of residence , the international market for the Bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard stands for more than 30.000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , the Compu@@ ter@@ ese will disman@@ tle further jobs in the spl@@ itting up of the company .
the actuators at the US Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs should be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall down from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disman@@ tling of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP still had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Share declined 2.3 percent .
the company , grown with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data stores for companies and other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of July at the end of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds go back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded with a split and massive sub@@ missions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man later re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more business online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ mans restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly encounter rejection : 54 percent were against it , 35 per cent agreed .
61 percent will find that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad reject 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 per cent would be responsible for this .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electric mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday .
like two years ago , the organizers of the V@@ DA Association expect around 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ laun@@ chers for several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water@@ shed .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
at first the officials stopped ring@@ ing pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drew somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees came together and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world ob@@ serves when the US staff is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and that interest rates will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate was NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ det , Managing Director of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to focus on increasing , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8.@@ 00 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have shot and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to reverse it .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb sailed 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives on Monday at a certain point in order to tell them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrived on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , such as his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
the Group restructuring will cost 150 out of around 1,000 executives around the world .
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
the Lufthansa sets up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline shared on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the Board of Directors for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap plane Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , representing three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ff with the cockpit association Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ stopped strike on this Thursday .
this shared the union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of the talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cockpit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to come to viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept is background . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this resulted in the left foreign defence and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bul@@ let and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a Red Card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ ration was wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a we@@ et to Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

with the European Championship in France , the UK @-@ Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost in@@ war@@ dly .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided to publish his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the action of the book , instead re@@ stores a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel listened and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly reading the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the action of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment through the gre@@ edy , trees f@@ row@@ ning , Th@@ need kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , slu@@ gg@@ ish being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ fall .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th precip@@ it@@ ates from the England Test K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , it would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully , if he hopefully kno@@ cks out any other shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good achievements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and abroad .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first set up Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must receive at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ eds immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me very much as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the training .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy gets into a f@@ lau@@ ght by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ developed new negotiation strategy to hold the UK in the EU is getting deeper every day even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y . &quot; is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour or TU@@ C leaders who viol@@ ently viol@@ ated Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und recently said that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contract changes , which they usually do not want , are sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance races like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may also intentionally not plan helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ one , as they did not have been during the referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed knew Mili@@ band who was his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but found that when one sits in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a backdoor .
the press has never denied him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cla@@ p on the back on Monday - I told him that he no longer need time for me - seems at risk of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC &apos;s sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ish @-@ dy@@ e tendency and the wild gra@@ dient of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs in him did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and members after all reports at their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to hold lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ al campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious elec@@ torate - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to demonstrate their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that obtaining funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports of the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of members of the committee are not supplied , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , also the tobacco leadership of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ is@@ cated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ a year .
by suggest@@ ing current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ern@@ ers , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ern@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in a hard @-@ disputed time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without any success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , which I do not consider to be a good idea medi@@ um@@ - or long @-@ term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs that could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ern@@ ers is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must see how this public television should be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for ratings &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows include what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how to sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they do not measure their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the radio fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think we all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate , train and maintain its ethics mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take a look at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , in &quot; inform@@ ing , explaining and entertaining . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial channels alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which for the human ear have too high frequencies to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics to be used by ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the desired position in the brain on an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the ar@@ mis@@ tice - through a legend of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blu@@ stering with bright colours and animation remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ baths year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people are often transformed into beverage recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meetings , but they are also the places where people attract themselves and pick up their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a university with a relationship
intro@@ vert gives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy I &apos;ve consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant is exhausted by soci@@ ability - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the peak of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighbourhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with that more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that prevents people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if they make a little qui@@ eter , because three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
when she stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she left their own music , closed their door and went to their three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ed if you consider a room@@ mate for her future spouse to go to her , to separate herself and then see her every day and maybe experience how she treats all common friends to her ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never di@@ gest someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
lock your door and place its keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ern off your possessions at the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single people , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dic@@ er
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the mother and the servant @-@ ear@@ ners alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how rapidly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here to a large extent .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough living space over the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of living .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three accommodation units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the specific needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have applied my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the set @-@ up regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still subordin@@ ate who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees but also the sing@@ ular mother or the poor servant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today .
that &apos;s what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message telling the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this impro@@ b@@ able by linking the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process has been completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch to half way and could result in a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full Att@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup runner @-@ second emphasized before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve season races so far , taking the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club , &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation received by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an expression of its connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ markt Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
from now on , directly next to the purchasing market , sen@@ iors and coun@@ sell@@ ors will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of the health and care insurance companies .
for years , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that often caring people are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many benefits are not claimed , because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new hous@@ eholder J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders in the demographic change see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre .
this makes a good de@@ centralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg essential in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the qu@@ arti@@ s office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ alizing gathering . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution , that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar surroundings .
the Qu@@ arti@@ s office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .

parking penalty : Tim Wiese gives polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was un@@ noticed in Bremen .
foot@@ b@@ aller was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , former @-@ nation@@ alt@@ or@@ keeper in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not admit intellec@@ tually .
meadow just cut the hair@@ s in the center of Bremen , when he saw out how outside a park atten@@ dant set out a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , Wiese rus@@ hed out of the business , insul@@ ted the officials and accused her of fine fine @-@ penalty in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
at the city of Bremen , one confirms the alleg@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it from the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether meadow will appear or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a sev@@ ent@@ een year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
one of these men now cried out to the young people and hit the face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ breaking and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he was initially dismissed by his sacrifice .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car to their home and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you saw the vehicle no more , the injured went before the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male figure .
with the help of a stroke you beat on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now only a vag@@ ue description of the perpetr@@ ator lies .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and investig@@ ators to sign up under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field breaks and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ hausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has good luck : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of field breaks on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ hausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at a half @-@ point in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he invested € 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their specialist training in the hospital and wants to get into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as I was , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of the couple Müller was to practise their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so you agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised there , his medical studies in Hanover followed by several stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a leading emergency doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ sen@@ hausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a family doctor .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a consultation room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of 50,000 Euros will be donated to the land@@ fill in the framework of a funding programme of the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that practice is being continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses joint mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks , in the North German average practice it is approximately 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ hausen .
if no successor had found himself , it would have gone too .
anyone who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation , by the way , continues to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Field breaks re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly they already feel after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also hau@@ led up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the supply and safety of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach didn &apos;t look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to restrict its borders to refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had already tried to travel by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would conver@@ ge Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade deb@@ ated , however , that it is the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were travelling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has arrived , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary can now come to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have passed a good witness to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbia &apos;s interior minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos , stopping the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee hel@@ pers have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is , however , not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminal who is accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
inside the financial markets , in@@ sider deals should be made with the collected information .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .

ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people complete their worries , sometimes quick walks , partly sn@@ ug@@ ly .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ on at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life with a wonderful autumn sun light and in the midst of it four big plates each with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe drew attention to its 20 year anniversary with this action and is perfectly confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some people spontaneously acc@@ use the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again , little discussions develop on the edge of the action , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end comes to this world , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the director of the Mannheim plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still cl@@ inging to tab@@ oos , according to the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of the people .

the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the funeral and funeral accompan@@ ists .
every two years , trainings for new employees are offered .

at that time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in fiscal year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
according to a pol@@ l of fac@@ t@@ kit , analysts expected 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the increase in price increases , the lower prospect will be 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , despite higher aggregates for heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November onwards .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid income when one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour power , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in his unit Express delivery for stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the soil transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
in the market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awa@@ ited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at one end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ story seat hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double assignment from the Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented interest rates by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal bonds - and is it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which un@@ sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average was 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress , an increase in the sentence .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month after China de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value fell in May by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , although the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authorities have become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of the leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of re@@ pris@@ als on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , pays for an increase in interest , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its control centre by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as the market quar@@ ry 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest on interest .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability and until this is changed , I do not believe that it should hur@@ ry the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the involvement of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she also teaches with her 74 differences .
every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , it is different lessons than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good food is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar panels .
plans for long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ welt are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council meeting the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee had previously decided on an application for a statutory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid building plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permit for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ central first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the inclin@@ ation of the roof , which was prescribed for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; regarding the roof inclin@@ ation , whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally tends to be more restric@@ tive in the case of deliver@@ ance orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a recurring project for gymn@@ as@@ tics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from school and width sports .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now submitted to the District Office of the Insp@@ ection Authority .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who do not have to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed about the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play at the question of who was to follow him , who agreed to take over the leadership from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
over the next two years , Fischer and his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has 35 beds , will be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , contra@@ ven@@ ed rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , should be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I exclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi removal to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in the past decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the palms of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) with the Berg@@ ische HC .
although the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal , there is no reason to be arro@@ gant .

Jag@@ oration with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in action , as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crime
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young@@ sters killed and threw their cor@@ ks into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has been missing a victim of violence since Saturday .
the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police ha@@ st@@ ened on Wednesday .
as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old prisoner was also arrested on Tuesday evening , who , in fact , admitted the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they did not come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially found personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the event of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally found .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities admitted that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ p@@ se into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a total charge on him .
disc@@ laim@@ er about the immediate circumstances should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing units , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany this year .
thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of the past few years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit , which will grow t@@ aller from year to year .
currently around 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains , author of the study .
many professionals therefore stayed in large cities in emergency rooms in shared flat areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the f@@ lau@@ ts on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has decreased for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction .
the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could not be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be suspended .
furthermore , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the alliance .
the funding programme for refugee accommodation of the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well underway in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the currently available around 300 million euros had been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia align corridor
there is practically no passage to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
new laws that came into force on the same day , moreover , make decent asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia .
according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and taxis into the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach a border fence .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , almost no more refugees are coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before the closing date on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws not@@ withstanding the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed there were therefore 35 criminal proceedings in@@ stituted .
the condemned thre@@ aten prison sentences up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it .
they collected waste that had left tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks at the road@@ side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; barriers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on instructions German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Passa@@ u by train .
because Germany had un@@ expect@@ edly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday but because of the influ@@ x of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and crossed the border with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before we left the un@@ fi@@ gured guests first once , with snack and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
but the regional train was de@@ posed in front of the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest joined together with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , day before a two brid@@ ging cycle sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke at the establishment of structures to ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees also need to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to produce decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
Konrad has to do with the refugee provision all hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place qu@@ arti@@ s for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad at the initial tak@@ eover centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Con@@ rad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without major vor@@ tices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
overall , Konrad comp@@ utes with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ish year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 lod@@ g@@ ings have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the cent@@ uri@@ ons .
they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also sets great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that quarters enco@@ ders have to maintain a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the harmon@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , is based on the fact that he is more successful in placing the interior ministry in placing accommodation .
I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth .
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur any costs of the Republic as they themselves declared .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
so far , your own quest for qu@@ arti@@ s has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz is calling for a better division
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design centre for housing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned are currently unable to submit these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of an emergency , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the head of the city is critic@@ ising the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limits are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has recorded the further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er ass@@ ures me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the protective seek@@ ers would , however , be brought to Germany by regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans , is that Austria is now taking control again at its borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the industrial line of Linz is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new ship@@ yard and later to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in its location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of rest area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wonder@@ ed if I should open a shop for a long time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz Europe that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been raised from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
at most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can also not answer the professional woman with last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s up to the fact that a beautiful bag of each outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a village called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for upright .
whether he expresses alien@@ ation or alien@@ ates journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presidential office hur@@ ts the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billion originate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant village are related to him over ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , to which besides Tr@@ ump is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for hum@@ ility , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also in the opinion that tr@@ ump is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the circum@@ ference , was &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the first real estate company was the corner@@ stone of the real estate company in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed to fail at the Bavarian State , which belonged to the Pal@@ at@@ inate at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was cut off without permission , had declared the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s Dog@@ s , Roland Paul , for the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ alt@@ z retired rather dis@@ soci@@ ates the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so infl@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 child @-@ singers , even in the USA the interest aw@@ akes .
the Upper Bavarian commun@@ e of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the Vice President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden national park on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighboring country , the local Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have no more than 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there were no big shifts in the ratings for today .
the N@@ ine Breakfast Show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull succeeded in throwing Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side seemed to have no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise .
in August Today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September Sunrise with an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 PM ) of the new quiz show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , resulted in 44@@ ,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
average Hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ lap the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly unknow@@ ingly revealed who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , when Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last Rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows the day before coming out of three , you might accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods latest rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her answers could become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condi@@ tionally set on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a smart decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t Return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn school in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not correspon@@ dingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag faction of the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue will over@@ lap the issue of asylum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the former Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need national uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in the city of Wielkopol@@ ska is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Kul@@ tus@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; secondary level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools , where an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um intermediate level was tested from three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all grammar schools wanting to do so .
free travel to G@@ 9 wherever desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
the German stock market is closed with profits after a long @-@ spann@@ ing and nervous trade history .
only in the afternoon , a fir@@ mer ki@@ ck@@ off of the US stock markets provided a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards .

the discussion about the loads from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and left deep marks even at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but in the end they were getting 3.@@ 31 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district officer said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber liners .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber com@@ rade , known from which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal ruled over centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
building area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post shall be rebuilt again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mix of trade , trade and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market approximately 4000 square meters of land in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the site for a mix of trade , trade and housing .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
the investor &apos;s question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded accordingly .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Corner of Big Street , already a few months ago and the building can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for a holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
for the first time , the investor made public plans for the project .
several tra@@ ilers are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure office
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , gri@@ eved , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; system construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went from the system building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details to the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , mer@@ cil@@ man and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ utter over@@ looked by everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus charges so that this pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable .

Google launches debt @-@ raising campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc . ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to bring $ 11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but because the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / sub@@ du@@ ed to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year war in Syria , which has driven over 4 million people this year .
many fled from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial for the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity operations have proved efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out in people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have collected data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c lau@@ re@@ ation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes disorder was completely dissolved at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes only partially dissolved at one percent and , in some cases , only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic which is currently being observed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and found out that the violent reaction of the United States attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put an end to violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 times increase in intake of dis@@ infection agents by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in children under 12 years of age that swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenues of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age reported the toxic control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ant in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents allegedly mixed up disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mouth water in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent which are very appealing for children .
dis@@ infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , especially in small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergency call centre at the K@@ ans@@ as University Hospital , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of straw@@ berry @-@ du@@ t@@ ch hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah all@@ u@@ ded her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed the head , &quot; Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ infection clo@@ ths and store suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ infection agents containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ infection agents and ex@@ iles them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the s@@ worn plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bul@@ lying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been slightly injured in a vehicle accident on the cross@@ bar between the northern and on herr@@ ing .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ roads towards the round@@ about industrial area and was too late that at the round@@ about had stopped two preceding vehicles .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his lor@@ ry into the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed this vehicle to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
the accident involving accidents involving accidents of about 10 000 Euros is reported by the police .

there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare themselves for confrontation with the Dutch championship leader .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show any highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of R@@ angers .
they speak about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m @-@ games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ am to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following retirement from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now has five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent over the U@@ K@@ s , as the figures of the Bureau of National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I will be witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available as places to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better to form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve done .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday for a house peace break in pel@@ vic area .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ins .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman negotiated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ in drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Integration Unit of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ take in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; see as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk around , and I want my owners to think I try my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , M@@ oo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart stayed in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L conduct a cow@@ ard@@ ly behaviour and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the coach have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff mistakenly assumed mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been so yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals because of claims about ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm Team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good .
Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ad of his team and said that they were only concentr@@ ating on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team is confident that they were worried they were worried about being beaten by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques all year round . but in the last six weeks we have made contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this appears again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a cra@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and which we consider exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like them .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks , or are there any points ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team is free at this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the final final in A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and landed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its declar@@ ations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a safety of $ 200,000 represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against damage , under conditions that he passes his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian pass to the police daily and stops at an exit barrier between 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in the direction of Basel before a permanent construction site .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident origin@@ ator tore completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage occurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately alar@@ ming her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January of this year and did not appear before the court for a hearing on March 24 of this year .
defense lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his understanding .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ es judgement until October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case but was held in custody for hearing from other cases still pending .
it was added before the date of the judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany for small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many hau@@ lers made fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreise Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal Inn since Tuesday .
they had come to the German side on foot through bridges and dam@@ s .
there they are received by Bundes@@ polic@@ emen and forwarded to the registration .
compared to the beginning of the week , more refugees once again met at the Munich Central Station in comparison with the start of the weekend .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital until 8 : 00 am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ners of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong deep is the foo@@ th@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who had gone over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D it is still possible to reck@@ on until Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ seek@@ er circle with bu@@ ds of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
the sun will look back on Friday again on Friday .
the crowd makes it : every two years the cars show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is particularly noticeable in the compact cars , which are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of the new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Meri@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan investor wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adapts perfectly to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DS 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers put a hand on the front end : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and is first integrated into Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an Ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel Justice prison , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on his free foot , was moved to a larger cell .
his position of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dge raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re@@ trial .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for the compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a shame to fear the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they spoke only in April to a prisoner of compensation because he was naked in a cell .
according to a human un@@ worthy decision of 2011 , the multi @-@ assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated every day between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
over the last few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been in the head@@ lines due to lack of staff .
for this reason , det@@ ain@@ ees are imprisoned again and again for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to bats it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied for young people , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the State ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built up until now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental objects : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and in order to attract these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments per year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the estimates of the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises the project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise labour .
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residen@@ cy obligation that restric@@ ts asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - mostly the perspective has been made that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that work@@ stations are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the Königs@@ weg path to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the rooted parents , it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ eln , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nonetheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for instance by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception has hitherto been Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now quit his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees may be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or de@@ for@@ estation do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law more if they begin studying .
the latter generally do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g because they do not fall under the circle of authorized persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees have had to live four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g to be eligible for 15 months on 1 January 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually swe@@ ep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ church law will further develop into a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also involves the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , breaking down discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination and universal equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention of Germany commit , must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected to date , according to Professor Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards right away .
services rendered could be deduc@@ ted later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors are above all making language barriers .
until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more poor@@ ly informed about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would need to be taken over , it calls for them .
many refugees have also helped with more general medical points of contact in emergency out@@ patients .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the youth it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
however , with the partially other diseases , German physicians come from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in regards to the shortage of doctors , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syrians would have developed a highly developed education system , some refugees even were doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates of the Federal Cham@@ bers of Psycho@@ therapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study at TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sc@@ and@@ ability and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices can make an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the welfare offices of mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to incorrect estimates , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst takes up the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract any age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the arena on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , teacher and junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current Man@@ e@@ gen@@ otyp@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift to the fan@@ sage is therefore the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to pick up people from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ lunch@@ with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus convinces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to easily absorb the Cu@@ ban duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with sensitivity and artic@@ ulation .
balancing with the wheel on a ball ?
there is no problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ ak@@ y people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read from the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to get into the arena .
so the highest commandment : good for the animals .
specially on their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
from 17th to 20th of sep@@ t@@ ember , the Circus Pro@@ bst takes you to his performances every day from 17 to 20 .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
it is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , desc@@ ended from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition by the opposition members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ung .
last month , they had rested it and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the members of Parliament that the immunity will end in the Parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers of the politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year , HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars in the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and will be focused on providing previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the place of birth of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and when his rehabilitation progres@@ ses according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four matches for England and in the face of its history his participation in the European Championship will surely be uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognizes , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture of ar@@ senal is that they have been in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last for the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career that he deserves .
Ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a little snow@@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal are clear favour@@ ites to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that ar@@ senal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ rates among young men prove at a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even though the isolation domin@@ ates reality .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on my head .
each character was defined not by his work but by his personality , which was shining through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case even if they often with@@ hold to explore their feelings fully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of phone pastoral care , it explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel depres@@ sive and self @-@ murder has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , if one speaks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ lasting cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the backdrop of a completely re@@ designed setting , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League , di Maria will meet on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani stopped course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League de@@ but@@ s as a PS@@ G player who brought the French master on their way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani earned a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since it does not only asp@@ ire to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c &apos;s missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , to create our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was exp@@ elled in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined with nine national players in the field and was ag@@ itated with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field , a heavy enemy .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ si@@ sts and bad deals , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who at no less than five attempts bl@@ amed in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill , if he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria converted into a shot that was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second door finally fell short after the hour @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season op@@ ener after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and out of the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized by a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December .
since then we played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification rounds are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers 2.5 billion $ through stock sales

the Gl@@ en@@ core business registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares amounting to about 1.6 billion pounds in order to pay off its own debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating impact on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of London &apos;s stock exchange on the early Wednesday morning .
the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to rep@@ ay about a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
the company sold its new equity hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , representing a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House Con@@ fir@@ med X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings Visit to Washington
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and said President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host the hosts of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state dinner after the two leaders have bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President &apos;s visit will offer the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i have the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , will probably meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for the FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league , four times champion league winner , two times champion world champion , twice world champion , a time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advis@@ es that he stood before the departure from Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also the registered FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time would have run with X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , turned out the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king &apos;s victory at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a succession of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the necessity of alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it in the occupation of the film and not in the line @-@ up of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ t un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian committed themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a ut@@ te beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People chose Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that her direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter had a national impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against farmers .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quietly matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life albums still have their meaning .
recently , the leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , never had a competition participant who could finish all levels of its obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge in full three seconds , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac had felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for an eighth relay , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ab@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings for 6 times and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ pen any game , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has curved the pl@@ ywood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he put it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the rear of the seventh ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second assistant Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the lef@@ th@@ anded Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who was torn by the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run in the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after adding an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game of an even un@@ moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game of the vulner@@ ability list after he had missed more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started to get rid of some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter in the first place , Hus@@ hes delivered a single to Second B@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third player Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right hand side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t strike very well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found herself in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the relief @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the worm school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP says Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start up against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has been missing since 20 August because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen , responsible for the initial up@@ take , had been arriving in H@@ esse alone .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive thinking about military options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective disposable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was very glad that the cup of military participation in Germany had passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the spot for the refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , in Hungary no one will be returned to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Manager for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees during a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee policy in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who needed protection would receive it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was clearly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometer border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania was sealed with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to told Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of people in Turkey went on their way to the Greek border .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the moon is easily tra@@ vers@@ ed on its orbit around the ring planets .
this exchange movement is small , but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing in Munich for several weeks
the 1860 Munich needs to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for a month on offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an examination revealed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared .
R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich &apos;s lions , the diagnosis &quot; is estimated to be four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a heart loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .

Tor@@ jäger Ru@@ bin O@@ ko@@ tie can return to the team training after his bra@@ ins shock next week .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training .
O@@ ko@@ tie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at the head .
contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .
no Di@@ et Fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits therefore support visual strength , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone does not tell anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or sweet foods .
a man@@ go gives also hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service UPS again represents up to 9@@ 5000 aids for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , UPS distributed on Tuesday .
especially drivers are sought .
as early as last year , UPS has increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service .
first fo@@ eh@@ n@@ ado , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ side of the F@@ öhn winds through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland , on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with the stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness through the F@@ eb@@ re@@ eler .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning , we cross a distinctive cold front that brings heavy rain , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest stre@@ ak .
on the north side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the valleys with bu@@ ds of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can penetrate up to the adjoining Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north of the Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the slope of the Alps .
here the rain begins , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , over 100 liters of rain per square meter have to be reck@@ oned to the south of the Alps .
on Thursday morning , the hair dri@@ fts out the air , in which a cold front rolls with a powerful , partially swe@@ at@@ y rain from West to East over Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind dev@@ ours sharply to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably .
the following days , in the north , autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the South , on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of town president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ator on Wednesday .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in secret their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries .
with this place , in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a mis@@ erable sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church with his theses against the deport@@ ation .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gil@@ ded crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now been published with magnificent pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can quite be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked for around three years on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has taken a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books .
there have been cycles that focus on themes such as cru@@ sts , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he was immediately fascinated by several partners : this applies to Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current context .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation in question .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to carry me back with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help the art more important in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and sense what strength they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday to present the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not pay attention to fully grasp the Bible , but chosen the most important and mysterious topics for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
plans made , place found , companies were instructed to model earth moun@@ ds for a circular course : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration made for dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railway .
thus hills moved up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be received in October , the first public company Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the child and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will be even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its engagement for refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is setting a clear mark on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in tackl@@ ing the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle nobody can say that &apos;s nothing about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and should help .
but the decisive course must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) , they will be able to carry the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sport boss Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can li@@ gi@@ ze football , no , we must use our bla@@ sting power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B @-@ Sel@@ ection and the German Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up all the sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : the Chief Executive Officer loses an eye in the event of an accident
according to the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , the left eye has been lost due to a fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he almost ble@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then drag@@ ged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was constantly in contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Central Station in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of skir@@ mis@@ h ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a reserve for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button as a spare @-@ driver for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we can &apos;t resort to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his master eleven on the Re@@ us position .
in this way , he announced a change in the position of the door@@ keeper .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of family keepers Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all European league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ esi@@ ght statement by Mit@@ player Re@@ us that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal is understandable by mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l : &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be technological pione@@ ers in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke at the IAA in Frankfurt on Wednesday at the IAA of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic jams , said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communication .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver .
with automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be expected only far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to more security and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent only reck@@ on in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents are reck@@ oned by 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are still not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 per cent .
well each fourth would not leave the control to the car under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current status at the title fight between September 25 and October 4 , Düsseldorf , the Düsseldorf wants to hit only in sing@@ les .
the final decision should be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight for a long @-@ term sponsored walk in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the se@@ ed@@ ings list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the world @-@ ranked fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has drawn a serious injury on his right leg .
at the Champions League match at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was hit by a tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits became the great star of fashion scene - and that he was wearing men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which can be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initially rej@@ ecting attitude towards a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was used : to make the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
according to the cur@@ ator , 14 tons of material have bar@@ red according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the October festival there was still a special gift : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , che@@ ap@@ ly fashionable Geh@@ attempts by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , he said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught himself the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion @-@ niche
in the past it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in a large quantity for customers who , for example , worked on blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ ving Head@@ quarters .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic epo@@ chs , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
in association with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there are almost no private dealers and wholesale dealers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass production is much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed through chains .
in addition , export is weak@@ ening , currently to Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points from environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ pearl in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been introducing a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine ch@@ okes small spheres at some points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I could not start with traditional p@@ lau@@ dry tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also returns to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney nevertheless dar@@ es to get a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie , but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director already stands firmly : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to foster growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group entrusted with the steering of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should stand up to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the Leadership Group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , private capital support , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list will be created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legally state business environment and open the market open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to run their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right to guarantee lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended prime minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to stimulate the consumers with a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding work paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , big pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold based on the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which accum@@ ulates strongly over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low volumes can cause particularly serious damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment declares on his homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants reported more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount of mercury em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequent reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
