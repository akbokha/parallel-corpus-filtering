Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal promoted by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship of the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech , partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not agreed with Obama , a meeting with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel was rejected .
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb said with a slightly s@@ itt@@ y voice from the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos;s body and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white sheet : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb did the fatal accident at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers compelled to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what motivated Lamb .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , describing the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both of them were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time some tendencies became problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb blessed , said he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trace , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be captured , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a home about a mile south of his par@@ ental home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in education in the spring .
one of the long@@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ tone said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years trying to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ tone , now 40 and live in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up both on a summer market three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had a Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth sounds before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , pres@@ ided over the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening around 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community participated in a candle light memorial ceremony at the Cle@@ vel@@ and Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l watch , while the university choir sang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss designated as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox swe@@ ats over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it is becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated crow@@ ning and an arm length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie the@@ aters in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the Council of Ministers this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in poll@@ s , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the ascending Her@@ man Cain , of which no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s stamina and start to drop their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative mind .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa announced last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about pumping ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb &apos;s Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first voting state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think he does not have the personality to execute his office effectively , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they put up their scholarship @-@ hat@@ s , Republi@@ can voters hold tr@@ ump for real . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Y@@ eb .
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination as opposed to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it appears that a variety of GO@@ P voters visit Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is gathering the majority support .
he got 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have imagined their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half the voters support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their voices .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse led to 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is critical His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the new orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey on Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do .
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son there is now around half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are mad at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fer@@ nal . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea resort .
in the street , a square meter of a th@@ et@@ ched roof costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which specific layers a square meter will cost the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places of residence , however , one of the price rises like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well marked .
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top without exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ Dream launch thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double goal scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a master@@ ful pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e brought a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the boiling pot of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her first performance in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ s. + 2 ) and i@@ dol &apos;s hit ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
in his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership Mu@@ eller received a boun@@ tiful support from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused a f@@ oul play of the World Champion to pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 promises of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held the word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated image without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus has won his latest six home games in the Royal category , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offen@@ se efforts they were often too resour@@ ceful to works .
the attacks were often initiated by the shift of the game to the left on the left , Douglas Costa , who rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first of all , as Olympic leader , Dr@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown , hit Poland &apos;s head@@ ball on the line ( 26 . ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; direct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; removal , the keeper Roberto was par@@ sing with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though Bavaria moved its usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set up need@@ les .
but he was reli@@ eved on keeper Manuel Neu@@ er .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New he let Guardi@@ ola defend a four @-@ chain bus with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the gradu@@ ation training , said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Matthias Sam@@ pler on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , it &apos;s vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an to the failed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
before the game , there was a crash in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly floo@@ ded Bavaria fans in their viewer block apparently provoked the followers of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only damage the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
the good news : when doing this , the risk rapidly decreases .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ eces .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time but write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , explained tut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; explained Director of a Boeing von DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the age of life . &quot;
smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good oral health up to the age of old .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness hit the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter rem@@ n@@ ants of the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the ump@@ teenth time .
near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the start of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the Cologne city district , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Monum@@ ents .
in the third part of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists have now found five .
from text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , described Trier .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves , probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman is picked up at the station in the gh@@ ost@@ s of the gh@@ ost@@ s , the Federal Police asks the people for help .
at the end of the railway platform the woman crossed the track at the end of the platform at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
as a result of the acquisition of the train , it has carried the he@@ avi@@ est injuries according to the Federal Police .
she was treated on the spot by emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by rescue workers .
about the reason of the ni@@ gh@@ tly track crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the investigating official .
the incident might have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

European Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to ev@@ acu@@ ate the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its mode of operation clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de plan to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TT@@ IP is intended to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings show con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should be equal to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
up to now , the parties agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators , a possibility of obj@@ ection to their judgments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there could then also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , particularly requested by large corporations , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judicial system , which allows companies to le@@ verage tax pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national legislation , or en@@ force a decrease in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act have described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism has been critic@@ ised above all for not having to apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , elabor@@ ated in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the legal possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) could be concluded , continued on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic Invest@@ ors Protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer valid .
delicacies of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ looking folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative ma@@ ze .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs appear , which harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in succession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ se@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a nationwide elaborate masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styli@@ stic sophistic@@ ation .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and no one @-@ year list of influential music media is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to highly productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sales pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth regular studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but played by programmable sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller clubs have desc@@ ended , the stage shows are here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the wide @-@ enriched album .
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; plate in the essence . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally tunes up with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s survey was eag@@ erly anticipated
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is expected to make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s question and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as she comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several front pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour , namely Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour has proposed changes to remove the whole idea of a constra@@ int overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory chief over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament last decade .
the Labour leader who promised another policy approach says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; impact and stri@@ fe &quot; and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela manages to represent the Sh@@ adows of the Chamber of Commerce if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the Lower House to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
as it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the prime minister was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his ent@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires extensive reforms .

pound increases by accelerated salary growth in the UK
the pound so@@ ared according to data showing an increase in the UK wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the net target of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and quick@@ est estimate since 2009 , at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction will combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods judges .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his app@@ rais@@ al for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the Sports Tour@@ ing Company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

obligation to school ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
even Bie@@ ber himself not .
he looked after him anyway .
for the advertising break of the supermarket he cas@@ c@@ aded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company washed many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and when each doll looks like he or she goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects .
if Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you will be amazed at the window pane .
it is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber finally be in the United States and Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest the many N@@ ul@@ len first .
at least he does .
Pe@@ gi@@ da @-@ Poster brings a Leban@@ ese idea to the idea of a potato hill@@ side idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
it is both - in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger ste@@ ak owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato@@ e instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop he has a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the Leban@@ ese has now submitted the idea to the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
that is why Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes are in the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also comes well with its customers .
Met@@ a@@ cash launches campaign for comb@@ ating algae inf@@ estation
Met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch before an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail trade in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and sell shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ approved tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual investment strategy day .
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets , and that all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers , will take away sales .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail traders could lose 360 $ million in revenue per year and Met@@ a@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA over the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ o &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash gains market share in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumed that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ o &apos;s sales and food business grew by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ a will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that Mr Dou@@ glass has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to match sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ o &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refur@@ bish@@ ment programmes are to be started at El@@ an and hopes that the big dealer will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ gios , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight by the not@@ orious examination of Kyr@@ gy@@ ms with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification round in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly after , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , with Har@@ rison crying out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to build Kyr@@ gy@@ ros , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kr@@ amp@@ f s@@ war@@ med a potential U.S. Open @-@ win of Richard Ga@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I encountered quite a bit is the fact that , after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too tightly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ ros at the important preliminary decision which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the control circles &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ ros &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick has quickly made the ascent , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . I think it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , with@@ drew refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the efforts to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants settled in a no man &apos;s land , and Serbian officials re@@ acted with ou@@ trage .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some with@@ drew from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border had not been able to reconci@@ le a common immigration policy for a day after the 28 @-@ nation blo@@ c at a disputed meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in over@@ crow@@ ned Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would pick up another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not put its hopes on an early action of Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation in two southern regions triggered on Tuesday gave authorities greater powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed at the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly contradic@@ ts other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia became a crime . these laws also set higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament still needs to appro@@ ve the military action expected next week , but Associated Press repor@@ ters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had caught 45 people attempting to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence ; they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
the authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and pressed a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to immig@@ rate to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead hal@@ ved before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her on the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion defines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profit .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support in males has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under the age of 50 has dissi@@ p@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a big lead in the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nationwide say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if it were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would support it only because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled above all by her .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about one quarter would enthusias@@ tically support it .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s support is also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also quoted .
as the Vice @-@ President sheds new potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who for the party were their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s supporters say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead to S@@ anders will increase , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped out of 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about their eligi@@ bility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month , not a single democratic candidate or any potential candidate for these sel@@ ections of prim@@ aries stands out to be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demo@@ cra@@ cies or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters in their party &apos;s prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities include Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den performs best in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server remain as Foreign Minister during the ten@@ ure , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in total .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion was wor@@ sen@@ ed by her .
there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters throughout the country also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks for leadership .
the six tested candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the primary elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump on nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is eliminated , and others lose their support dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sw@@ elled from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell from the bottom , with 10 % support last month now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor of Florida J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are located at 6 % in the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son increases in poll@@ s - with 19 % support in Republi@@ cans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the latest pol@@ l from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising over the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ guards for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son accused himself of ques@@ tioning Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea any more : the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
swimming temperatures , on the other hand , still offer the Mediterranean : in the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five Brotherhood members charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College Neul@@ ing
almost two years after a student passed away during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an@@ suits are filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a ceremony in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police informed .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about headache , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically put the benefit of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be resur@@ rec@@ ted , and he died in his injuries the next morning .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries on the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the ski slopes every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the third rank of murder for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of false attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organisation that - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned it , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College prohi@@ bits the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the place of residence .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase in interest comes , and the house will fall into conten@@ tion , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guide to the procedure .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so severely that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a view based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can be volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency for net assets to be deduc@@ ted from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the del@@ aying in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after adver@@ ts of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is mostly upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rise , fairly flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ding to occur later in the raising cycle and the return on it begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that it did not exist before and could accelerate the recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the case of a raise of interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank 118 interest rate increases since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP to 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rises in such a fragile economic backdrop might be ris@@ ky and raise the question as to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants prepared interest in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put in the shade after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been a total of 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , yields appear to change direction once the initial increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the raising cycle , the bond@@ men endi@@ ds immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and entire sectors , companies that wind up the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts become worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high @-@ capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts differ in how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of Parliament critic@@ ised the sender for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ b@@ bing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they were only im@@ it@@ ating The Br@@ its
Parliament co @-@ worker Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham said also to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards launched last year seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and public education .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that hard work had to be made to engage the public when it did so in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s production , which , during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , came under fire to push the commercial rival on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he would like the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time a series of entertainment starts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down its spending
for over a decade virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost@@ s .
however , experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their cell phone purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday where buyers fought for bar@@ gains could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that a bit more than £ 1 was spent online at £ 5 .
in some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion labels in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during crane mis@@ carri@@ ages - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia in part den@@ oun@@ ces the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mother .
bear@@ ers filled , largely dressed in white , the circuit to pay their respect when the first of the dead began their last journey to the al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed on at the holy site , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for bur@@ ial when the Saudi king sent a sanc@@ tion to Bin Laden &apos;s construction company for the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the large central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the p@@ addle to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
king Sal@@ man said today that the Bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the crane , when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the Cran@@ e falling into a courtyard of the Greater mos@@ que where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ an , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ruled the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , which is managed by the Bin Laden Group .
bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European crafts@@ man is over
British employ more and more craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has risen behind
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that target tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out their work in their home
if you can handle sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to painting walls , nowadays you seem to belong to a minority today .
the British employ increasingly professional tra@@ des@@ people to conduct DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open up to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to professional tra@@ des@@ men and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to hire more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate at the staff .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to move this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our women consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in semi @-@ annual profit and sales after the Group was training the cost of closing the shops .
as a result of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will be opening 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball Vice @-@ Minister A@@ ich / D@@ ob acted as responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and aband@@ on@@ ment .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted from this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the accused decided that in the years 2006 to 2011 the def@@ end@@ ants used mon@@ ies of association accounts that they could disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also charged with financial years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact separated from the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that there was no asset in the association at any time .
the sports officials had only calculated changes of expenditure and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we faced the situation : do we continue the club or lock we ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the B@@ read @-@ based Audi@@ tor of the Financial Office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in cash on delivery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debts .
furthermore , in the case of appropriate financial success , the compensation of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed bookings appeared , the former ob@@ servers explained the processes .
the accounts and savings accounts shared the two def@@ end@@ ants , the second def@@ end@@ ant said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the payments were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial support , but it was important that only the freedom of debt was important , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the bank account for official abuse in 2011 .
these were the def@@ end@@ ants , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know how to answer it for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about that money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this bank transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims repar@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With whom you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he merely calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not demonstrate the def@@ end@@ ants .
these were not kept in place after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
he explained in his statement that all of the Beh@@ avi@@ our had to be made in cash , for which he had to go to the Bank from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the interview of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard lives another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , the company will continue to develop further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
there is no end to the positions at the US computer terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) were saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall on from the fourth quarter .
the disman@@ tling of 55@@ ,000 jobs , which has been ongoing for three years , has not yet been concluded .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP still had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share yields 2.3 percent on the market .
the company , grown with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , California , now spl@@ its up into a new company - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data stores for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be recorded on the stock exchange .
recently , a dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers in accordance with its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the management of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late for customers to buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more business online .
the overall restructuring plan shows the disman@@ tling of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
the direct participation of German soldiers in fighting operations in Iraq would , however , predominantly encounter rejection : 54 percent opposed it , 35 per cent agreed .

24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian governor , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed say that 20 percent would be responsible for this .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wers against several hundred refugees housed in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s Serbian border .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the departure of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed , and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water@@ bed .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers initially set aside per@@ tin@@ ent pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
in this way the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees packed together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and that interest rates will last from 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate was NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero area and start a normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ dding , Senior Consul@@ tant at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8@@ pm CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University left ap@@ ology
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he felt sorry for the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said that he shot on someone and killed anyone .
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency department that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb sailed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb re@@ port@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrived on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb fled his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a PhD degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life of life on the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
the Group restructuring will cost 150 of the 1,000 executives worldwide .
there are , however , new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
the Lufthansa strengthens its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate a contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline shared on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a board member for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap plane Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the board team headed by chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
to date , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 staff was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Pass@@ enger Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ff with the cockpit association Cockpit ( VC ) negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the judi@@ ci@@ ally stopped strike on this Thursday .
this shared the union .
the theme of the talks is intended to be the retirement regulations for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cockpit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be able to produce viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots the background is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa is stock@@ pil@@ ing Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors routes to the company &apos;s own cheap line .

hat@@ ch Sha@@ w of Manchester United won &apos;t be able to play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brings the left external def@@ enders to weeping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double refra@@ ction and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be published tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ court .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ ration was mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack on both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery now begins , I come back more strongly . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno had a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost in@@ war@@ dly .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental disaster of Dr. Se@@ uss , published in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to always be a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything is nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the action of the book , instead re@@ stores a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of T@@ ed @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partially read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees , Th@@ ought stri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ lers , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , stub@@ born creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR function was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably from Cameron &apos;s Choice V@@ oting Office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th clearly threatened the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
b@@ umping into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali emerged as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th res@@ ig@@ ns from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own destiny .
hopefully , if he kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his stance , even if he did not get such good achievements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven odds - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ play .
the only accus@@ ation we can raise was that England first set up Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer that I highly recommend .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season early when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and got four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and he has already shown that he is a Cri@@ cket @-@ player &apos;s vi@@ cious circle .
mos@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ eds immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me very much as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever add @-@ ons to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , isn &apos;t used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem with that .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Ex@@ it Great Britain out of the EU ) could attract Zul@@ u if the economy gets into a sl@@ ur@@ ry by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s non @-@ fer@@ mented new negotiation strategy to hold the UK in the EU is getting deeper every day even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who has viol@@ ently fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU , and not always on their own debt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contract amendments that they often do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
German conserv@@ ation@@ ist Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened with the exagger@@ ating out@@ patient such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will pull themselves off a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won no value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ one , as they were not in 1975 during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones and pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als , most of our large newspapers .
actually , Tony Bla@@ ir thought like her , but found out that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved EU constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly tap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer need to waste time for me - seems at risk of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s , an error back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ colour@@ ette tendency and the wild yel@@ low@@ ish of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their session on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to hold his support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ett Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left @-@ stri@@ cken dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign for leaving - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors in all .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious elec@@ tors - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of when it was launched on Monday that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alleg@@ ations of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking began from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded that Lanc@@ et critici@@ zed the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month reached the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely win@@ dy base &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the asser@@ tions &quot; on stone or sand were built . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a decision analysis model ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to demonstrate their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained how to get funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports by Philip Mor@@ ris International &apos;s tobacco company , they added .
the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting aren &apos;t known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the Tob@@ acco administration of P@@ he took part .
the Group &apos;s research work says that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; damage in most of the criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health System 2 billion pounds per year .
due to the clear presentation of recent evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ re , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ er@@ time and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in harsh cont@@ ested time frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get into contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are ordered or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is non@@ sense , of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programs show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ er@@ ism .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify a £ 4 billion radio fee , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
of course you all think , we all think you get a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for people who are for the £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Eth@@ ics mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform , form and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ casts enter alli@@ ances in order to make everything available online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; son@@ o@@ genetic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can control brain cells through sound waves &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which for the human ear have too high frequencies to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on of mo@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms normally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the modified mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the desired position in the brain on an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass freely and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons fair - by a stor@@ ef@@ ront of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic t@@ wit@@ ty corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those I have anno@@ yed - and on the numerous , long @-@ handed complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from easily irrit@@ ating to absolute sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to w@@ addle : people tell whence you are , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ches , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like as opposed to those you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , film @-@ night venues and municipal meetings , but they are also the places where people dress and pick up their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a university with a relationship
intro@@ vert obtained a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the peak of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with them more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the saying .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if there was something to give them a bit sof@@ ter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep for two hours before making her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be ab@@ ys@@ mal embarrass@@ ing if you are a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , going to her , separating herself and seeing her every day , and perhaps taking part in the way she draws together all common friends .
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never mind someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
lock your door and place its key in a glass of water that you put into the freezer - but don &apos;t stap@@ le your bel@@ ong@@ ings at the ceiling no more than twice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the single mother and the needy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass placing of containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a large part .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough living space over the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs very little space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of flats .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : legally , I did my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the setting regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still subject , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is there a lack of space .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true is it : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the alone nur@@ turing mother or the needy .
I show you how to build even today cheap and well .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App , tap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , because they get an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean clearing apps to make room - but Apple has made it more prob@@ able by linking the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is charged while updating or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may turn off on a half way and lead to break@@ age of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg has only one motto in his fight for World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full Att@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the start in the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup runner pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points race the runner @-@ up champion before the race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ time champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve races so far and is also starting the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
for days a bell @-@ bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neigh@@ b@@ oured island Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded three months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen at K@@ ur .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation received by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and Anton@@ ín &apos;s senior centre have collabor@@ ated under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new qu@@ arti@@ s office has recently been opened .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice for advice receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health care and nursing services .
for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient nursing staff to be left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many insurance benefits are not seldom used because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant for the elderly and for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new qu@@ arti@@ s office also offers prevention , health care and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training , or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , preventive and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center in particular in the demographic change .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good de@@ centralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration ceremonies , the qu@@ arti@@ s office also dedic@@ ates itself to the lon@@ el@@ iness in the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
in this way , the Social Fund makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and good as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

parking penalty : Tim Wiese order polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was un@@ noticed in Bremen .
foot@@ b@@ aller was once , now Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim are engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellec@@ tually , he did not agree with it .
in the inner city of Bremen , a meadow just cut the hair when he saw outside a parking atten@@ dant set out a leaf@@ let for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , the court hur@@ ried out of the business , insul@@ ted the officer , and repro@@ ached her for a fine @-@ headed penalty , as reported by the Bild &quot; newspaper .
at the city of Bremen , one confirms the alleg@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only afterwards I will decide whether the meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating about 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a sev@@ ent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed , according to the police , his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point , the group was at the level of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the petrol station .
and one of these men cried out to the young man , and struck him in his face with his f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg@@ ged @-@ break and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ ased to the ra@@ cket , he first dismissed from his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their apartment and demonstr@@ atively drove over there .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured person went before the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a stroke you beat on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator description lies ahead .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ hausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Business Pro@@ mot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has good luck : on October 1st Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ sen@@ hausen .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ hausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing aside for his successor in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested € 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ u@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ sen@@ aus@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their specialist training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Corn@@ stand@@ ausen and laugh@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea to run their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so we agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with practice .
meanwhile , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was raised , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in the Di@@ ep@@ holz District and volunteer in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Tests hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September onwards , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ sen@@ hausen works as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle as general practitioners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the reconstruction the rooms look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaker room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of 50,000 euros is given to the land@@ fill in the framework of a funding programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that practice is being continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses joint Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients enter the practice of Fel@@ sen@@ hausen in every quarter , in the average in North German average there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no follow@@ er found himself , it would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultations , by the way , continue to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their f@@ arewell , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the medi@@ cs practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel ri@@ p@@ auses re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly they feel after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also being driven up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provision and safety of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave the refugees arriving in Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach didn &apos;t look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already severely controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to negl@@ ect its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must complete his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to go back in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police managed to pick them up in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving at the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , would meet Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had travelled all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary turned over , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route , Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , to a somewhat further west distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently testified to the country regarding the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side , there are still approximately 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning with a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high numbers of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise immigrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute land maps to the refugees on which alternative routes have been drawn up by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatia war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been repro@@ ached since 2010 to gain insight into even un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire .
inside the financial markets , in@@ sider deals are said to have been made with the exploited information .
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , more than $ 100 million were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states it in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are to have acted in the United States as well as from Eastern Europe .

again and again there are small discussions about the action in itself , about life , the handling of death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 year old .
however , it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , according to the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to opening up the people .
an assessment that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the funeral and funeral accompan@@ ist is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid was looking for volunteers by calling , she immediately announced that she was part of the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives are accompanied by private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from a different point of view , consider it precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Services is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ation@@ ist .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as continuing education and supervision of the death and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants .
every two years , trainings for new employees are offered .
the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes can also be recorded on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Mi@@ xing Fi@@ xed , Financial Cris@@ is Re@@ duc@@ ed for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant lowered his profit prospects for an entire year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his land transport service .
the company also said that she plans to recru@@ it about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in the previous forecast .
according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts were expecting $ 10,@@ 84 .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will take effect on January 4th , despite higher sur@@ charges for land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nevertheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid yields if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex spent 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts at Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts surv@@ eyed six of Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipping , which generated sales in his unit Express delivery to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales of land transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher operating costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awa@@ ited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the cor@@ p@@ se for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is lo@@ oming over them at one end of the decorated two @-@ story cour@@ t@@ room .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mission from the Congress : maxim@@ izing US occupation and prices keeping stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unprecedented third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives fear@@ ful to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and even just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which un@@ sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts can sof@@ ten the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage R@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a raise of interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress to raise the sentence .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world sent together at the end of last month , after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage R@@ ally dropped by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , although the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the May high .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il influence the complex calculation when interest should be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authorities have become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere reference of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates an increase in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited perc@@ ussions for growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with her body and soul .
she also likes to teach with her 74 differences .
every Thursday , she does it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , it is quite different lessons than at a proper school .
Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good food is during breast @-@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited sports hall construction on the Bern@@ ese Sports site progres@@ ses step by step : in the recent municipal council meeting , the prepared construction application has been unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
the committee had previously decided on an application to a statutory exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; and &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected with a non @-@ central first and a roof over@@ hang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar systems : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderfully large southern roof together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the roof incline , which was prescribed for energetic reasons , was supposed to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the pitch of the roof - whereby the Bern@@ ese Municip@@ ality generally tends to be restric@@ tive in the case of liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a recurring project for gymn@@ as@@ tics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some EUR 2.3 million are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and mass sports promotion .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter @-@ large hall is now presented to the District Office for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is shown by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the administrative district , confirmed by the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with fis@@ her and the still existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed about the plans .
the change has spark@@ ed the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should follow him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means , in any case , a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
over the next two years , if the supervisory board agrees to agree on both houses until next year , the former prison hospital , which still has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 if the currently running renov@@ ations at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital are completed .
land@@ tra@@ it@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , contra@@ sted rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m closing off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was received positively and very understanding by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened in recent decades by closure , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

hunting trip with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in action , as the police announced .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were put into hospitals .
how exactly the accident could come about was unclear at first .
the det@@ ective police were identified .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who had been missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 year old admitted that the youth killed and threw their cor@@ p@@ se into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violence .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as attorney general and police ha@@ st@@ ened on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , captured on Tuesday evening , was considered to be active and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning , after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially launched personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of surveys among friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 year old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ se in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented on Wednesday to the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put a death blow to him .
information about the circumstances of the act should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against mosquito bit@@ es
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened by many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Verb@@ än@@ verbal verbal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany .
thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first accommodation facility .
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the ten@@ ants .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the residential building policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting down a housing deficit , which is increasing from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 residential units have been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Weber compl@@ ains , author of the study .
for this reason many professionals lived in large cities in a not@@ orious apartment in shared flat @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults were reluc@@ tant to stay in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Finn@@ s on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita had fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing construction .
in this way , the basic income tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could be suspended .
moreover , according to the alliance , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are needed .
the funding programme for refugee camps at the Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been retri@@ eved at € 184 million on Monday evening .
now the project could be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia strai@@ gh@@ ten the corridor
there is practically no more transit to Hungary since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announc@@ ing that the transit over Slovenia to the north remains without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia is planning to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the death of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been forced to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , virtually eliminate the need for ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police seized the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived with the bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across border guards .
this is why the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
just before closing on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damaging of the border zone as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned were sentenced to five years imprisonment and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; , of which nearly all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a chance to receive asylum in Hungary anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; barrier &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees .
moreover , the country has reinforced its border controls .
the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government figures .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instructions from German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday , we were busy with the clean @-@ up , when ten people suddenly stood with travel @-@ off@@ ers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Passa@@ u by train .
but because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday but because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drove the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before we first heard the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
one man did not let himself take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from one ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u . after the short notice , the train traffic to Germany was stopped , but to try to cross the border .
the regional train was turned off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross border is generally high on the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbors was soci@@ able on Sunday , on the day before a two brid@@ le run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures that ensure humanity , our German Chancellor has publicly and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge , given the ongoing floods and the coming winter to make decent conditions for people seeking protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
Konrad has all hands full to do with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place districts for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ rad has already taken a grip on the chaos in the initial reception centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we no longer have hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees arriving in Austria on Monday was without a great deal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quar@@ ts in the previous year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees to create districts .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , in order to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator will also expect great expectations in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that squ@@ ir@@ ers have to maintain a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the sky@@ light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful in placing his accommodation , he founded Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman who is not going to say the truth without further into the face .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t cause the republic any cost as they explained themselves .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
up to now , my own quest for neighbour@@ hoods has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz challenges a better division
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design centre for refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the person concerned can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of emergency , however , further sites should be checked for their suitability .
the head of the city is critici@@ zed by the parti@@ tioning of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the national leader , Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , records further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
however , the protection @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now introducing controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for ag@@ it@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the industrial line in Linz is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T has moved in , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new ship@@ yard and later on to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin open second store in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade in a nut@@ shell : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop versus the business in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks had been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have wonder@@ ed for a long time , if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own location , in which only their hand@@ bags are sold , were done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has been raised from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman is in rap@@ ture with the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the woman also cannot answer with last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag will enhance every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose habit@@ ants are named investors .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for upright .
whether it is alien@@ ating or alien@@ ating journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office bu@@ ys the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fresh@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant village is related over -@@ nin@@ ety corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a movie about tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it quite exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native of K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , to whom apart from Tr@@ ump including the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a bit of a big mouth says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name that K@@ all@@ stadt got around , &quot; Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
therefore , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the history of Tr@@ ump began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not pick up Tr@@ ump , because he was once h@@ ew@@ n off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , had declared the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , at the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked testim@@ onies of descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born baby , the grand@@ pa was born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Win@@ emaker &quot; retired rather dis@@ soci@@ ates the American , &quot; he is always so explosive . &quot;
does he believe that tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm insi@@ sts like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the don@@ ald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t get the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wn at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have come there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ t@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 child @-@ singers , even in the USA the interest aw@@ akes .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have no more than 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protective area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to assume the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there were no big changes in today &apos;s ratings .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival of Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ Days , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five main cities compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) was achieved , but its number remains behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
in the past few months today , Today , the gap to Sunrise has closed .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 Sunrise periods .
at the beginning of the year , there was a gap between 40,000 and 50,000 .
as of now , sunrise on average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 pm ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e revealed an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour there was a full 7@@ 20,000 .
average of 6@@ 20,000 Hot @-@ Se@@ at .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for one million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ lap the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets un@@ veiled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally ends in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last Rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before coming out of three , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues to seal his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have in a ly@@ rical way om@@ itted why Wood is the perfect man and thereby named his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you who should get W@@ oods last Rose &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers might become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and observed ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought it all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ anne &apos;s Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now pre@@ ten@@ ding to set it up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests following his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the match to the Bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity for a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ek at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian descent had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the austr@@ ali@@ an Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a po@@ orer start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees .
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn school in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get uph@@ eav@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag fraction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the free voters conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually quite different main topics were envis@@ aged .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue will over@@ camp asylum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Security Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as existed during the ninet@@ een @-@ n@@ ine@@ ties during the Yugosla@@ v Wars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the independent voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national policy in the city of Wielkopol@@ ska is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing favourite remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; secondary plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um secondary stage was tested from three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all high schools wanting to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel to the G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber com@@ rade , which is known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ arus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled over hundreds of years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but legis@@ lators have speed@@ ed up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post shall be till@@ ed again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are still no concrete proposals .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den intends to market approximately 4000 square meters of land in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the area for a mix of trade , commercial and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor will come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had purchased a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Corner Great Street , already a few months ago and the building demoli@@ shed to it .
P@@ ieve project : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday houses at the Little Sea in Em@@ den is taking shape .
for the first time , the investor made public plans for the project .
several tra@@ ilers are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , slan@@ ted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday house at the little sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective customer , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction were called out by fierce reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , mer@@ cil@@ man and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ utter overlooking every other building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , like several other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus charges must come to be balanced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the good one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we must have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches campaign of dou@@ bling donations to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / sub@@ du@@ ed to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity and type 2 diabetes have proved efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan took data from Taiwan &apos;s Min Sh@@ eng General Hospital , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ c@@ ers - on medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was completely dis@@ b@@ anded and 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved at only one percent and partly at only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved bigger BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are references from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer lives , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was among obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attempted more conventional methods .
although the new study did not show any benefits for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is often observed in the literature : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the shame of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story the novel should be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama was praised by Germany and Austria in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put on violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of intake of dis@@ infection agents by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years that swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , cases of recei@@ pts from hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age reporting the toxic control centres rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them end up in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how adolescents drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange fragrance , which are very appealing for children .
hand dis@@ infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially in small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergency emergency center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in H@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer in reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry and hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice above the threshold that was legally prescribed by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah le@@ aned her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had kno@@ cked her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly to my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store suspended disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to deaths via alcohol pois@@ oning .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York State were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to the disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the stra@@ ined plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and dis@@ semin@@ ated disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
following the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat prevailed against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now standing at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly this way - but we need to go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because it makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously at January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , pointing out that he made a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing up new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad &apos;s unity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic target person Mich@@ u with reference note
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and has not made the finish from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts on S@@ FA battle suspended because of N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the Hear@@ ts took 2 : 1 when pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; I have not questioned any integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ks
the incredible Hi@@ bee was re@@ proved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stri@@ ker , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I will not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ks when it is not for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ häuser Governing Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team is still confident in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
we will bring the guys back on track , &quot; Don@@ nel@@ ly said .
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; win over against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ tives to see a seventh consecutive league win giving them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which have not won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as indicated by the figures of the Bureau of National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year since Scotland had taken the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see a man being brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch them emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he &apos;d do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peace @-@ break @-@ incident in pel@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ hand@@ ell S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned out to be a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ins .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy states that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ ff sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat down for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk around and I want my owners to think I &apos;m trying my best for them .
if you start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ist that the integrity section tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , veter@@ an president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L conduct a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fru@@ stration levels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the trainer have been built up with the long @-@ term cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching meant that he said he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license above the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the beaten Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees wrong@@ ly applied mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it had it on the race day too .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals because of claims about ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critici@@ zed his player &apos;s tac@@ kl@@ ing as an &quot; agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm Team , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing they were only focused on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team is confident that she was worried that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or the techniques all year round . but in the past six weeks we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es a real centre of gravity and that has provided us with a turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to lose , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny , as this always appears again and again at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds her ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons has won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like them .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks done and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the storm team is free at this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the Pre @-@ Final at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ ans with 200,000 dollar security deposit after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a lifetime penalty due to his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and landed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long punishment for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : leader &apos;s cab ri@@ ps apart
a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel .
the third driver did not notice it too late and tried in vain to turn to the left in the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident causing rup@@ ture broke completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage occurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep , logged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and he then said to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searches on the computer were performed by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to have taken up in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year on 25 January this year and did not appear before the Court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ es judgment to October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on other cases still pending .
it was added before the date of the judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ gs switch to small border cross@@ ings from Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
out of fear of discovery and arrest , many floo@@ d@@ ders spread the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they had reached the German side by foot via bridges and bar@@ ges .
there they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded for registration .
compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station again met much more refugees .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man in the morning said .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : extension of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south @-@ west expected &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against pet@@ rels in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe flows warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong point is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Alps and in the Lake District with bends of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun is shining again longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA every two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is mainly movement among the compact cars , which are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the show .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel offers a glimpse of the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16,@@ 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is available in five @-@ door versions .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact cars ?

at the beginning of next year he comes to the trade , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan ji@@ b wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully adapts to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .

the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to the manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger presented his hand at the front end : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ painted and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
the inf@@ otainment system was especially modernis@@ ed in the interior , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , there will be a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court was entitled to a former prisoner of the Te@@ gel Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally have the right to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the suffer@@ ers can even hope for money if they were locked up in narrow spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in this way an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin Te@@ gel Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Station between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on his free foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his official position due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dge raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Justice and rejected the case for re@@ trial .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the level of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of custody were decisive for compensation , a compensation claim was given , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of the protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of criminal law .
so they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
moreover , on Wednesday in Karlsruhe , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had issued an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated for three months between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the case of Karlsruhe .
in recent weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons have been hit by the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
therefore prisoners are always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to th@@ u@@ gs it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information provided by the press office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied for lack of young talent , 19 are to be canc@@ eled in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the testimony of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do that , and we are creating that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different predic@@ tions between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , apartments are annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also promote refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 80 000 social apartments per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a common agreement between scientists and federal mini@@ stries in the fact that there is also more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , &quot; says Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich enth@@ ann .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the ban on work for refugees to recognise jobs .
whereas previously there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the residence duty that asylum seek@@ ers limited to a residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - there has been a majority in the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market sooner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of German knowledge is a big barrier to access to the labour market .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ inking , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nonetheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for instance by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared for classes with no knowledge of German at will .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ones of the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state granting asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
admission to the university could be facilit@@ ated by willing students .
because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement of residence or debt do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law more if they begin a course of study .
the latter basically do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the authorized persons .
tolerated refugees have had to live four years in Germany to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ eligible , from 1 January 2016 , this range will be shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap needs to be closed , however , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get rid of b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively assign to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ church law will further develop into a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic charity organization that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also belong to duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant them certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to su@@ e such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , pushing down discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stak@@ eholder groups are demanding for a long time , and what international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens want to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected to date , as reported by the doctor @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery claims to hand out health cards to all newcom@@ ers alike .
the services rendered could later be invo@@ iced with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to plan so many people with the restricted service catalogue , which the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors are above all making language barriers .
previously , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more poor@@ ly informed about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpretation costs have to be taken over , they demand .
many refugees also helped with more general medical points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are much more un@@ attended disability , and the young people are talking about HIV .
however , with some of the other disease pictures , German doctors know about their education , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the shortage of physicians is concerned , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have developed a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to practise , however , they must prove their qualification and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates of the Federal College of Psycho@@ therapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and terr@@ ors .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , usually experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ interpretations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst takes on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to attract any age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus festival invites you to dream in the arena on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior boss .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e@@ gen@@ esis .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst .
thus , the gift for lovers lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to bring people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
the Cu@@ ban duo wants to take up the Cu@@ ban duo easily with the heroes of the silent movies .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is intended to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous sal@@ v@@ ings , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst looks fascinating with intuition and ag@@ ility .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
there is no problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ ak@@ e@@ men are fascinating and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little other and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst took his position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called ection@@ ately , is read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to get into the arena .
so the top@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing has happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with it whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly . &quot;
the cir@@ cus promot@@ er invites you from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm to his performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
it is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
last month , they had rested on him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the Members of Parliament that immunity will end in Parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts will result in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars as of the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual turnover and will be focused on providing previously un@@ riv@@ alled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to handle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the wounded Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four matches for England , and in the face of its history , his participation in the European Championship will surely be uncertain in the next summer .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten your career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a big issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd. has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture of ar@@ senal is that they have been in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League clubs which recorded most of the vulner@@ ability days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement will pers@@ ist in the injury rates during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body will stabili@@ ze , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to take a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sh@@ attered by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the hope of leading the association to its first European Cup triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more doub@@ t@@ ful than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men between 20 and 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece in the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication related to social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that is far more profound in our mental health .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ ed through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to it , even though they often hold back completely to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone support explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ destruc@@ ted has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit at this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop of a completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
during his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani continued his course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ haus@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League de@@ but@@ s as a PS@@ G player who brought the French master on their way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani gained a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Chess@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they do not only strive for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c &apos;s missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t score one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was bla@@ sted by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he passed in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined the field with nine national players and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field , a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps Center in the 3@@ 4th minute , they didn &apos;t attack anything .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes arose , with some mis@@ si@@ les and bad deals , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only in the first half at no less than five attempts , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot that was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second goal finally fell shortly after the hour @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . so the Urugu@@ ay@@ an obtained his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back in the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result down before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi demonstrated a gate in the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game from them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , accumulated $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt redemption plan .
the Gl@@ en@@ core business registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to rep@@ ay its own debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling commodity prices because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought gl@@ en@@ cores &apos;s stock price to the top of the London stock exchange on the early Wednesday morning .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the broader plans to rep@@ ay about a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
the company sold the new equity hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , representing a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and said President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosts of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner this evening after the two leaders have bilateral discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President &apos;s visit will provide an opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of differences of opinion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola did not switch to FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion league , twice a World Champion , the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was already from Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered version of the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann acquired the Bayern Munich .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record @-@ master : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , turned out the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on faced the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen scenario .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ t un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian confirmed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of the harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a ut@@ te beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
the producer of Dear White People picked up the film directing rights for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio . Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement threatened national impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against col@@ oni@@ alism .
in February , the singer Prince introduced a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album sil@@ ently matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned First Champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge in three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or lived more than 10,000 US $ , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the grand gratu@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had revers@@ ed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , al@@ beit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scores three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside for 6 times and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and so I want to go into the game quite focused .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has curved the pl@@ ywood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ pen and he put it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh interior , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton concluded the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the lef@@ th@@ anded Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run away from the right @-@ h@@ ander Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen made the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after adding a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inside , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ done and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed ski@@ pper , however , made S@@ ano out of three pitches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited from a non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es at the start of the game .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two sessions against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had missed more than a month for a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after they got the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ hes delivered a single to Second B@@ aman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the middle of the game with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third friend , Nick Castell@@ an@@ os , followed a single on the right hand side , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not strike very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es three hits came to six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an infrin@@ gement of the litter school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder tie , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP will das@@ h Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to compete against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has been missing on the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to come down in Wiesbaden

his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived here should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city Wiesbaden airing on Tuesday evening .
it counted on refugees arriving from 450 to 750 .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse had arrived in Hessen according to the government pres@@ idency of the government .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also furnished emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive reflections on military options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he designed the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective directions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict has ended up at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the former German ambassador in Washington called for a massive increase of international aid on the spot for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in ORF , Austria . no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement on which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann jointly requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee mission in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Federal Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would get it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided into the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be brid@@ ged with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is unlike Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent traffi@@ ckers from seeking ev@@ asive routes across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants reported in Turkey on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds an ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us

&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon is therefore easily tra@@ vers@@ ed on its orbit around the ring planets .
this pi@@ geon motion is only small , but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) , Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .

R@@ ama lam@@ ented pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis means &quot; probably four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a heart loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ settled expert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the 1960s first presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no Di@@ et Fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often rather dep@@ rec@@ ated by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - above all su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them , B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
the person who eats the fruits therefore supports visual strength , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone doesn &apos;t tell you how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet dishes .
a man@@ go gives also sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads , such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first fo@@ eh@@ il@@ storm , then prominent cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with strength through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after fo@@ eh@@ ing on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south@@ western stream .
on the north side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night .
in the wake of the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bu@@ ds of 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adic@@ ally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can penetrate up to the adjoining Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday storms stor@@ my hair for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine clo@@ ak .
here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , over the next 48 hours , in total , over 100 liters of rain per square meter have to be expected in the south of the Alps , this after heavy rainf@@ all has already fallen during the last few days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn winds its way , in which a cold front pul@@ ls with a powerful , partially thunder@@ ing rain from west to east across Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind will fres@@ hen up strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days in the north come autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Platz in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es over the centuries could often only live in secret their faith .
with this place , it is symbo@@ lically visible that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
at that time , he felt the city as a rotten label .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on the trade of aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gil@@ ded crown of thorns is one of the master@@ pieces that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked for approximately three years on his bi@@ ble @-@ project , for which he has taken a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
cycles have emerged that focus on topics such as dead@@ lines , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
he immediately fascin@@ ates several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of his painting .
he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and translated into current context .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between Martin Luther &apos;s original Bible quotation and one sentence of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 year old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the cataly@@ st for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant rule of rule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education took place already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up that in order to be able to forgive me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to help art again in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt seeks to &quot; let the viewers come &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was present on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old have not taken care to fully grasp the Bible , but rather have chosen the mysterious themes that are important to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result was a picture Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for M@@ öh@@ ler , Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s pictures speak both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X train is approaching
plans made , place was found , companies charged , ear@@ ing for a round course model@@ ed : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was finally over again .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration made for dr@@ unk@@ enness , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the train .
so hill pushed up , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
permission will be received in October , the first public tender Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to report to the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees by 2019 and the Bundes@@ liga represents a clear mark on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in tackl@@ ing the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been holding this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle that nothing matters to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and should help .
but the decisive turn@@ around must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal mini@@ stries also support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ sports chief , Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obvi@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we football feder@@ ates , no , we must use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships against Hungary this Friday .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ enc@@ ers had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 euros in cooperation with the DF@@ B and the German Federal Government for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of SAP loses sight in case of accident
according to several reports , Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a down@@ fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , then drag@@ ged himself out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , however , can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday Edition ) Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP head office in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of combat ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes into question as a reserve keeper for the two Stam@@ b@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button during the weekend in Singapore , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : meadows at the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load on its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem eleven to the Re@@ us position .
he thus announced a change in the position of the go@@ al@@ keeper .
for this reason Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of family hei@@ rs Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soccer teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be deployed in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ebo@@ ding statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final match for the BV@@ B in the Europa League needs to be the goal is understandable by mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany is to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investing in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the Auto Show IAA in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 States , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the Department of Transport of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and an increase in digital radio communication .
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not impose additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make sure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government is also committed to am@@ ending the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads cannot be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD &apos;s transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the drivers &quot; personal data must be clearly defined .
however , the German auto @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the audit organization Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will become en@@ forced in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect that in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed expect to use autonomous driving cars by 20@@ 25 , 33 percent in the US .
in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after surve@@ ying the digital network of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire ride on all roads .
on the motorway , there could be a 15 percent reduction in traffic in flowing traffic , at a traffic jam of 45 percent .
well each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis championship
according to current status at the title fight from September 25 to October 4 , Düsseldorf only wants to hit in sing@@ les .
the final decision shall be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight for a long @-@ term arranged sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained MEP Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the se@@ ed@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Timo added , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Fi@@ fth Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , amongst others , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ached in the past , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the designer has changed his initially rej@@ ecting posture to a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was done : to dev@@ ote the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have moved 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the October festival there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion experiments of the designer .
as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a doll his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught himself the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion @-@ niche
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery @-@ machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , elabor@@ ated on blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone is no longer working today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en company .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , fashion played a major role , and was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt lists some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
the so @-@ called Vintage Mode , borrow@@ ed from past styli@@ stic epo@@ chs , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who doesn &apos;t use niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut off .
there are almost no more private dealers and wholesale dealers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , export , currently to Russia and to the USA , weak@@ ens .
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office at the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension gap between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine sticks little balls at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ dry lace - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney nevertheless dar@@ es to get a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el playing 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny .
it &apos;s about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already certain : ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider out@@ wards to foster growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should invest in attrac@@ ting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new spin @-@ offs and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines including a negative list for regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is drawn up , sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role to the market in allocation of resources , guarantees a legally @-@ state business environment and open the market open , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attor@@ neys &apos; right to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ or fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch critic@@ ised the EU &apos;s work paper : &quot; risks and side effects failed industry and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and infants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , however , are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches must not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ eable .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram mercury per kilogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are generally so low that they are already resp@@ ecting the maximum levels planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in g@@ ossi@@ p is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which strongly accum@@ ulates over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government warns against the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts can potentially cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on his homepage with regard to the maximum values in force but that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury enters the environment mainly through the inc@@ iner@@ ation of coal .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants report more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide sur@@ passed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequent reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
