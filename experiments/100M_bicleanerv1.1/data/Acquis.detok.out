"" "the term" "" "Convention" "" "used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol." ""
The purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I concerning securing measures.
The objective of the procedure laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear targets for unknown purposes as well as the deterrence of such a junction by the risk of early detection.
To enrich the target defined in Article 28, material accounting is used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance, fading with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures.
The technical conclusion of the audit by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material which is not proven for a certain period of time is specified with the accuracy limits for the specified megen.
In carrying out their inspections, the organization makes full use of the Community's security system in accordance with Article 3.
The accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones.
In the application of their preventive measures, the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following types of use and, as far as necessary, foresee how they are determined in the supplementary agreements and are useful:
A) a measurement system to determine the amounts of residual, lost, lost, lost or otherwise removed nuclear material and inventory;
B) Review of the reproducibility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of the uncertainty of the measurement;
C) Procedure for determination, testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and recipient;
E) procedures for assessing the accumulation of non-measured holdings and not measured losses;
F) a protocol and report system, which displays the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory including inputs and outputs of the material balance zone;
G) precautions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly;
H) Procedure for reimbursement of reports to the organization in line with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.
The security measures under this agreement do not cover material in mining or ore preparation.
B) if uranium or thorium-containing material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c), is introduced into the states, the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material, provided that it is not implemented for specific non-nuclear purposes;
C) leaves nuclear material suitable for the composition and purity for the production of fuel or isotope enrichment, the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention.
A) The preventive measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not applicable, the Community believes that the recovery of nuclear material, which is subject to security measures according to this Convention, is temporarily not possible or desirable, the organisation and community shall consult each other about the application of appropriate securing measures.
B) The preventive measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, provided that the organization and the Community are perceptibly aware that this core material is practically non-recoverable.
At the request of the Community, the organisation frees the following core material from the security measures according to this Convention:
A) Special splittable material when used in gram or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments;
B) Nuclear material when it is used in non-nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and
C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of plutonium-238, which is over 80%.
At the request of the Community, the organization resolves core material, which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention, from these preventive measures, provided that the total amount of core material liberated in the states due to this Article in the states is at no time more than
A) a total of one kilogram of particulary material that can consist of one or more of the following materials:
II) Uran with an enrichment of 0,2 (20%) and above, calculated by multiplying his weight with enrichment,
III) uranium with an enrichment that lies below 0.2 (20%) and above the natural uranium, calculated by multiplying its weight with the fivefold square of fortification;
B) altogether ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with an enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);
C) twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;
If delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with nuclear material that is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention, precautions for re-application of the securing measures are taken on that material.
The community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements which are necessary to determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied to the extent that is required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention.
The supplemental agreements can be extended or amended without changing the agreement between the organization and the community.
The supplemental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the Organization, the Community and the States undertake every effort to make these agreements come into effect within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.
The organisation, based on the initial report cited in Article 62, provides a summarised inventory of the entire core material in the States, irrespective of its origin, and carries out this inventory on the basis of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.
Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other
The GRÜNDE - a) The EWG decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income whose development is impeded by general resource management problems.
C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.
D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.
To this end, the Organisation of the EEC put forward a table from which it is purposely intended to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -
The Organization sets out a special account under the name "special action account" which consists of the funds that member states contribute to the special interaction account in accordance with this Agreement; this account is referred to by the organization as Administrator-Repository and used (in this property the organization is referred to as "caretaker"), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
The special interaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.
The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes issued by the member state, which are payable on demand in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.
B) Payment is carried out in two installments, and the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker agreed upon;
II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.
C) Each Member State may make payments in advance of the above-mentioned dates.
According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportional pulling on the cash or the Notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special interaction account in an appropriate manner.
Under the conditions of the EEC, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in the granting of these loans:
III) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;
VI) of the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discounted; and
VII) The extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources.
Each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly discernible development program or project (including sectoral forecasting) regardless of whether it is part of the organization's loan program or not, according to the procedures and practices applied to the organization of fund-funded development loans, which is to be considered as the preamble for this agreement.
The funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinal means by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are subject to a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.
Apart from section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms which apply to the development loan granted by the organization; they are thus repayable in ten years each in 50 years.
Special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.
Amounts for the payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it.
Each special transaction loan is to be rejected by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the caretaker, in which the origin of the funds is specifically stated.
The proceeds from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or rendered (i) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator determined at the time of loan granted, could be recipients of a special transaction loan.
Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are made to the special interaction account, and the amount refunded in the currency of a member state is to be remitted as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned.
The bailiff will instruct the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the complete awarding of all the special transaction loans to the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors.
During the period of payment of the special transaction loan, the Managing Director teaches the EWG quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditures made for this purpose.
The Administrator obliges the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization for this statement of accounts.
After full payment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker of the EEC shall submit a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special interaction account as soon as possible.
The administrator creates and performs suitable records and accounts, from which the contributions to the special interaction account, the amounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the withdrawals made to the Member States are visible.
The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to reach the goals of this agreement.
To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the Administrator up to the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the state of the special interaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions, and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement.
If this agreement is not in force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date which the EEC and the Organisation may agree, the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it shall be due immediately.
If the total capital amount of all of the special transaction loans taken by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is repaid and transferred to the Member States, the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect.
This agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC under the procedural provisions of each party.
The governments of the Member States shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities to terminate the proceedings in question.
The Secretariat initiates these notifications along with a Notification on the regular approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organisation.
This agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notifications at the organization.
This agreement is written in two headings in Danish, German, English, French, Italian and Dutch, and each wording is equally binding.

The BIS could conclude standby loan agreements with the central banks of the creditor countries when banks make a corresponding application.
The agreements may be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the creditor country to the mechanism paid by the creditor, within a total limit of 2.725 billion accounting units; this corresponds to 50% of all future delivery funds of the member states.
"" "however, some conditions have already been called" "" "BIS" "" "below." ""
With each Standby loan, the BIS would initially assume an obligation for two years, with the possibility of renewals, but without a total of five years.
At the opening of the loans as well as in their possible extension the BIS would charge a credit opening commission.
In addition, it is agreed that the first draws will not be made before the end of one month after the Standby agreement is concluded so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity.
The drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BIS at the conclusion of the agreement, most likely in US dollars; they would extend to periods of time that would be taken into account the means of the Bank, presumably three or six months.
The conditions would correspond to those applied by the BIS at the respective point in under similar conditions, i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates.
However, if the BIS has to acquire the necessary funds on the market, then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the corresponding margin of increased Libor.
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities.

Any contracting party may terminate this Convention, subject to a period of one year, by showing to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
A reagent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples containing antigen that is homologous to the antibody or any other substance on the label.
If a reagent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer, the following factors or phenomena may not appear: a) hämolytic properties;
The titer is measured twice in a suitable medium by dilution of the reagent to be tested.
The titer is the reciprocal value of the number of the strongest serum dilution, in which a reaction occurs; the dilution is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood circulation in the total volume.
Anti-A, Anti-B or other reagents used on object carriers, the activity is expressed by the time required for agglutination on an object beam.
The World Health Organization has established international standards for anti-A and Anti-B as well as incomplete anti-D reagents for blood group determination, and for reagents of other specificity, standards are elaborated at the time.
According to the definition, an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml, and this definition is independent of the titers observed in individual preparations red blood cells (1).
(1) The effectiveness of the reagents for blood group determination of most specificties is expressed as agglutinationist, which is observed in a series of dilutions in erythrocytic floods.
The titer gives dilution of the reagent in the last mixture within a series, in which a microscopically visible agglutination occurs.
The effectiveness of the reagents for blood group determination, for the international standard preparations (currently Anti-A and Anti-B as well as incomplete Anti-D), can be expressed on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units (See Bulletin of OMS 1954, 10, 937, 941 - 1950, 3, 301.).
If you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml, the Anti-A and Anti-B Shear, according to definition, contain 256 international units per ml.
The preparations are available free of charge from the International laboratory for biological standards of the World Health Organization, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen.
The following table shows an example of comparing the international standard serum Anti-A (S) and an "unknown" Anti-A Reagent (U) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A2B. > PIC FILE = "T0045083" >
If a reagent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer, its required properties shall remain for at least one year.
The expiry date of a reagent in liquid form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test.
The expiry date for dry reagents on the label is based on the results of the tests by the government; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities.
Dry reagents are kept in an atmosphere of inert gas or vacuum, in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter.
A dry reagent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosphorus oxyd at a pressure of no more than 0.02 mm Hg within 24 hours.
In order to avoid bacterial growth, the competent governmental authority can determine that an antiseptic and / or antibiotic are added to the reagent (or the solvents supplied with the dry reagents), provided that the reagent has the conditions of specificity and effectiveness.
Sera human origin for the determination of blood groups must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or resolved serum.
The reagents, whether in fluid form or after re-dissolution, must be transparent and must not contain sediments, gels or visible particles.
The reagents for the determination of blood groups for the international exchange should not be artificially colored, at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system.
Reagents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such quantities and in such quantities that the reagent located in a vessel is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells, but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells.
The quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol.
The manufacturer's laboratory has written written records of all stages of production and checks of reagents for blood group identification.
Adequate samples of all the reagents are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used.
Reagents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human, animal, plant (or mineral) origin; some of them represent the effective part, the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the reagent.
For technical reasons these reagents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective interest.
This does not mean that the reagents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reagents can contain no substances of human origin.
On each individual container a black on white printed label is to be attached in English and French, which contains the following information: 1. name and address of the manufacturer,
4. the quantity or, in dried reagents, the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for reactivation,
In addition, this label or label has the following information on the box in which the individual containers are located, or the use instructions attached to the containers: 1. full name and address of the manufacturer,
3. the quantity or, in dried reagents, the quantity and composition of the liquid needed to recover,
Each shipment shall be accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention pursuant to the Annex to this Protocol.
Anti-A serum is extracted from the blood of selected individuals from the B group, which can be immunised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A.
Anti-A serum agglutines human red blood cells containing A-antigen, i.e. those of group A and AB, including the subgroup A1, A2, A1B and A2B. there are no human red blood cells that do not contain A-antigen, i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B.

An Anti-B serum is parallel to the re-dissolved, but undiluted international standard preparation of the anti-B blood group serum or equivalent comparination against an infusion of B-blood cells.
If Anti-B serum is mixed on an object bearer with a similar amount of 5- to 10% infusion of B-blood cells, the agglutination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the re-dissolved, but undiluted, standard preparation of the anti-B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of same avidity.
Anti-A + Anti-B (group 0) Serum is extracted from the blood of selected individuals of the group 0, which can be immunised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B.
Anti-A + Anti-B (Group 0) Serum agglutinates human red blood cells that contain agglutinus Clay A and B, i.e. those of group A including subgroups A1 and A2 of group B and group AB, including subgroups A1B and A2B; agglutination does not contain any human red blood cells that do not contain Agglutinus A or B, i.e. those of group 0.
Agglutinates human red blood cells that contain the Ax (AY or Ao) antigen (which are generally not agglutinated by the anti-A serum of group B blood donors).
An Anti-A + Anti-B (Group 0) serum is parallel to the re-dissolved, but undiluted standard of the standard anti-A blood group serum or equivalent comparision to titrate against infusion of A1 and A2 blood cells.
In addition, it is parallel to the re-dissolved, but undiluted standard preparatory of the Anti-B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison apparatus against an infusion of B-blood cells.
The effectiveness of the serum should in no case be less than 64 international units per ml.
Anti-A + Anti-B (group 0) blood serum must also cause an easy detectable agglutination of the blood cells of the Ax group (AY or Ao).
If an Anti-A + Anti-B (Group 0) serum is mixed on an object bearer with equal amounts of 5- to 10% flooding of A1 and A2 blood cells, the agglutination must be performed within the double time required if the same tests are performed with the re-dissolved, but undiluted, standard preparation of the anti-A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal activity.

If an Anti-A + Anti-B (group 0) serum is mixed on an object bearer with the same amount of 5 to 10% infusion of Ax (AY or Ao) blood cells, the agglutination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C.
Anti-Rh blood groups sera each specificity can belong to one of two types, which differ by the conditions under which agglutination of homologous blood cells is reached.
"" "with others referred to as" "" "incompletely" "", "agglutination can only be achieved if certain colloids such as beef calf or other special methods are used." ""
"" "some" "" "incomplete" "" "serums agglutinate homologous red blood cells in their own serum or plasma." ""
The following requirements for the effectiveness of Sera for determining the Rh group are possibly to change if international standard preparations are available. i) Anti-D (Anti-Rho) blood group serum (human)
Anti-D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals immune to the antigen D of the Rh system.
It reacts with human red blood cells that contain antigen D but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the antigen D.
"complete" Anti-D Sera must have a titer of at least 1: 32 compared to CcDee blood cells in a 0.9percent saline solution.
"" "an" "" "incomplete" "" "Anti-D serum is parallel to the re-dissolved, but undiluted standard preparation of the incomplete Anti-D (Anti-Rho) serum or equivalent comparision to CcDee blood cells." ""
In addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the antigen D, the serum should react with blood cells that contain do-antigen.
Anti-D Sera, which is intended for use of slides in accordance with the Diamond and Abelson test, must have visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination must be complete within 120 seconds.
Anti-C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immune to the agglutinogenic C of the Rh system.
It reacts with flooding of human red blood cells containing the antigen C, but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C-antigen.
These Sera are therefore only specific for the C-antigen only if the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.9percent saline solution.
The titer of the Anti-C Sera ("complete" or "incomplete") must be at least 1: 8 versus ccddee blood cells.
Anti-C Sera, which are intended for use on object carriers according to Diamond and Abelson (and no form of anti-D), must have visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination must be complete within 120 seconds.
Anti-E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals immune to the antigen E of the Rh system.
"" "anti-E Sera (" "" "complete" "" "or" "" "incomplete" "" ") should have a titer of at least 1: 8 against ccddEe blood cells." ""
Anti-E Sera, which are intended for use on object carriers according to Diamond and Abelson (and must in no form contain anti-D), must have visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination must be completed within 120 seconds.
Sera of the specificity Anti-D + -C and the specificity Anti-D + -E can be obtained directly from the blood of immunised individuals or can be produced by mixing of anti-D with anti-C or anti-E serum.
In a given serum, both antibodies have to be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer.
If a serum for use on object carriers is determined in accordance with the Diamond and Abelson test, the agglutination time in all types of red blood cells, which show a reaction, should not be lower than with the pro-haired antibodies.
Anti-A serum is extracted from the blood of animals which can be immunised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A.

An anti-human globulin serum must cause a strong agglutination of the red blood cells in the delivered form or on the label indicated on the label if it is loaded with a titre of 1: 4 (or less) when the titration with D-positive blood cells is performed after the "albumin-replacement" method.
In the same dilution it must agglutinate the K-positive human red blood cells, sensitized with selected weak Anti-K antibodies and the Fya-positive red blood cells with selected weak anti-Fya antibodies.
In the same or other dilution described on the label it must also agglutinate human red blood cells, which are sensitized in the presence of fresh human serum with weak complete binding incomplete anti-Lea antibodies.
For clinical use, the loading should be detectable with all types of the above-mentioned incomplete antibodies with a single thinning of the anti-human-globulin serum.
Anti-A Reagent is obtained by extracting from seeds or other parts of a suitable plant and, if necessary, subsequent cleansing.
The anti-A reagent agglutinated human red blood cells, which contain A-antigens, i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB, including the subgroups A1, A2, A1B and A2B; it agglutinates no human red blood cells that do not contain A-antigen, i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B.
An Anti-A Reagent is parallel to the re-dissolved, but undiluted standard of the standard anti-A blood group serum or equivalent comparision to titrate against infusion of A1-, A2- and A2B-blood cells (1).
The effectiveness of the reagent should in no case be less than 64 international units per ml.

Anti-B reagent is obtained by extraction from the appropriate part of a suitable plant and, if necessary, subsequent purification.
The anti-B reagent agglutinated human red blood cells, which contain agglutinogenic B, i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB; it agglutinates no human red blood cells that do not contain agglutinogenic B, i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and A.
If Anti-B reagent is mixed on an object bearer with a similar amount of 5- to 10% Flooding of B-blood cells, the agglutination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the re-dissolved, but undiluted international standard preparation of the anti-B blood group serum or a standard preparation of same avidity.
