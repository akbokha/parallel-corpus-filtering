( 2 ) If the laws and other provisions of a contracting party do not envis@@ age the settlement of the input or output lev@@ y in the cases referred to in paragraph 1 , then the Tran@@ sylvania has to obli@@ ge , under the same conditions , to pay a payment in the amount of the input or output lev@@ y to possible default interest .
( 3 ) Every contracting party shall determine the amount of the Ho@@ ech@@ st , which may be required for each Car@@ net TI@@ R according to paragra@@ phs 1 and 2 .

( 2 ) The request for the expul@@ sion of the amounts stated in Article 8 paragra@@ phs 1 and 2 is to be addressed to the guarantee association at the earliest three months and at the latest two years after the notification to the association that the Car@@ net is not settled or has been frau@@ dul@@ ently or frau@@ dul@@ ently en@@ acted .

( 1 ) No special customs document is required for the temporary import of road vehicles , trucks or containers used for goods transport in the TI@@ R process .
( 2 ) Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 does not prevent a contracting party to demand that the destination agency is taking precau@@ tionary measures envis@@ aged by national law to ensure that the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or the container is re@@ port@@ edly carried out after the termination of the TI@@ R transport .
road vehicles or load trains carrying out a TI@@ R transport must have a right @-@ cla@@ d table with the inscription &quot; TI@@ R &quot; in front and at the back .
these panels must be installed in such a way that they are well visible ; they must be det@@ achable .

the customs authorities , however , can also create their own customs declar@@ ations if this is required for the inspection .
( 2 ) The customs declar@@ ations recognised by a contracting party shall enjoy the same legal protection as the national customs declar@@ ations in their field .
customs authorities may only be accompanied by road vehicles , trucks or containers in their country at the expense of the transport contractor ,

customs authorities inspect the goods loading of a road vehicle , a lor@@ ry or a container at a passage @-@ passage or on the way , so they must note on the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections which are used in their country , on the corresponding pedi@@ gre@@ es and on the sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , and the type of checks executed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R .
if customs declar@@ ations are viol@@ ated or damaged in other cases as indicated in articles 24 and 35 , or damaged or damaged in violation of customs regulations , Annex 1 includes instructions for use of the Car@@ net TI@@ R method and the protocol contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R ; the domestic legal provisions remain unaffected .
( 1 ) In the case of a transport with Car@@ net TI@@ R on a partial distance , the territory of a state which is not the contracting party of the present Convention , the TI@@ R Transport will be suspended during the passage through this area .
in such a case , the customs authorities of the contracting party , through whose territory the goods are transported , will recognize the Car@@ net TI@@ R for the sequ@@ el of the TI@@ R transport , provided that the customs declar@@ ations and / or the identity signs have remained intact .
( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route on which the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R does not use the Car@@ net in the territory of a contracting party because simpler methods are offered for customs declar@@ ations or the use of such a procedure is not necessary .
( 3 ) In such cases , the customs authorities in which the TI@@ R transport is suspended or resum@@ ed shall be considered as the passage of passage at the exit or through customs clearance at the entrance .
subject to the provisions of this Convention , in particular of Article 18 , the intended destination clearance can be replaced by another destination .

the passage of departure may require that charge lists , photographs , plans , etc . , which are necessary for the protection of the goods transported , must be added to the Car@@ net TI@@ R .
in this case , it ob@@ serves these papers with its stamp , stap@@ les a copy on the back of the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R wrapping paper and re@@ members this in all forms of commodities .
the customs clearance of each contracting party recognizes the customs declar@@ ations and / or disclosure notes attached by the competent authorities of the other contracting parties .
however , you can also attach customs declar@@ ations and / or n@@ em@@ ency marks , but must note the net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in their country , on the corresponding root sheets and on the remaining sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , and / or reference marks .

the Community and States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appoint a fifth who will pres@@ ide .
if the Community and States or the Organization have not appointed two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration request , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint that arbitr@@ ator .
the same procedure shall apply if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are eligible , and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding on the organisation , the Community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapon states , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Association , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
II . if the community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other at the request of one of the contracting parties about a change in this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director shall promptly notify all Member States of the Organization of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day the organization of the Community and States receive the written notification that their procedures for entry into force are completed .
B ) This Convention shall remain in force for so long as the states are the contracting party of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I concerning securing measures .
the objective of the procedure laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear targets for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ r@@ ence of such a junction by the risk of early detection .
to enrich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the audit by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material which is not proven for a certain period of time is specified with the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their inspections , the organization makes full use of the Community &apos;s security system in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
in the application of their preventive measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following types of use and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined in the supplementary agreements and are useful :
a ) a measurement system to determine the amounts of residual , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed nuclear material and inventory ;
B ) Review of the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of the uncertainty of the measurement ;
C ) Procedure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system , which displays the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory including inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Procedure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in line with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures under this agreement do not cover material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) if ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material suitable for the composition and purity for the production of fuel or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not applicable , the Community believes that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to security measures according to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , the organisation and community shall consult each other about the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community are percep@@ ti@@ bly aware that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures according to this Convention :
a ) Special spl@@ itt@@ able material when used in gram or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material when it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization resol@@ ves core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these preventive measures , provided that the total amount of core material liber@@ ated in the states due to this Article in the states is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kilogram of partic@@ ul@@ ary material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of forti@@ fication ;
B ) altogether ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with nuclear material that is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions for re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material .
the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements which are necessary to determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied to the extent that is required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention .
the suppl@@ em@@ ental agreements can be extended or amended without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
the suppl@@ em@@ ental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake every effort to make these agreements come into effect within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organisation , based on the initial report cited in Article 62 , provides a summar@@ ised inventory of the entire core material in the States , irrespective of its origin , and carries out this inventory on the basis of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EW@@ G decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income whose development is imped@@ ed by general resource management problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the Organisation of the EEC put forward a table from which it is pur@@ pos@@ ely intended to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -
the Organization sets out a special account under the name &quot; special action account &quot; which consists of the funds that member states contribute to the special interaction account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is referred to by the organization as Administrator @-@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special interaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes issued by the member state , which are payable on demand in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) Payment is carried out in two install@@ ments , and the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional pulling on the cash or the Notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special interaction account in an appropriate manner .
under the conditions of the EEC , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in the granting of these loans :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ counted ; and
VII ) The extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble development program or project ( including sec@@ toral forec@@ asting ) regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices applied to the organization of fund @-@ funded development loans , which is to be considered as the pre@@ am@@ ble for this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ord@@ inal means by the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are subject to a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms which apply to the development loan granted by the organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in ten years each in 50 years .
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
each special transaction loan is to be rejected by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the funds is specifically stated .
the proceeds from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or rendered ( i ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator determined at the time of loan granted , could be recipients of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are made to the special interaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the bai@@ li@@ ff will instruc@@ t the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the complete awar@@ ding of all the special transaction loans to the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
during the period of payment of the special transaction loan , the Managing Director teaches the EW@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this purpose .
the Administrator obli@@ ges the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization for this statement of accounts .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the EEC shall submit a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special interaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs suitable records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special interaction account , the amounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the withdraw@@ als made to the Member States are visible .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to reach the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Administrator up to the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the state of the special interaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not in force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date which the EEC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it shall be due immediately .
if the total capital amount of all of the special transaction loans taken by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States , the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC under the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States shall notify the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the proceedings in question .
the Sec@@ retariat initi@@ ates these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the regular approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is written in two head@@ ings in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and each wording is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T has issued the following statement :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and the Plasma Physics
the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , called Eur@@ atom , is represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called the &quot; Commission . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a Joint Venture according to chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Venture J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area in question .
since even extensive work is to be carried out until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summar@@ ise their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research , which have acquired a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement should enable each contracting party to take advantage of unnecessary overl@@ aps by mer@@ ging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both research work , i.@@ e . the cost @-@ wise competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction to achieve faster .
to reach the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this Agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme assumes long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or changed after examination by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the contracting parties adop@@ ts a new program , this will take place at the place of the programmes listed in Annex I and II to the present agreement .
the association provided in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom is concerned with the same objective that Switzerland particip@@ ates with the time of entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the time of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Common Company J@@ ET whose articles are accepted .
Eur@@ atom is also concerned with the fact that Switzerland contracting parties may become contractual partners of any contract , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the organs engaged in the implementation of the association provided in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Association Agreement , in particular , advis@@ es the establishment of a steering committee , which is composed of representatives of the Commission and the Council of the Federation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities related to this agreement .
it particularly encourages co @-@ operation and coordination between the associated organs and establishes their T * activities in the interest of both parties to the common objective specified in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme , as well as to the common objective specified in Article 1 of the present agreement , which shall be taken into account in the world of scientific and technological developments .
in accordance with its Rules of Procedure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek it .

in the form of a letter to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in addition to simpli@@ fying the procedure for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the event of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it also appears to be shown in the agreement an article 12 .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community for these changes , and propose you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s consent to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements
the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when banks make a corresponding application .
the agreements may be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , some conditions have already been called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BI@@ S &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with each Stand@@ by loan , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as in their possible extension the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it is agreed that the first draws will not be made before the end of one month after the Stand@@ by agreement is concluded so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time that would be taken into account the means of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applied by the BI@@ S at the respective point in under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to acquire the necessary funds on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand @-@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks make an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracting parties shall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meet all the necessary measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to free the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion falls under the jurisdiction of the Community , which is based on the Treaty by which it has been established , which possesses the necessary powers ;
whereas it is necessary to carry out the article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , that the European Economic Community could become the contracting party of the Convention -
the Convention enters into force on the first day of the month following the signature .
on the first day of the month it comes into force following the day the last of the contracting parties has deposited its acceptance certificate with the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) This Additional Protocol , however , occurs after the exp@@ iry of two years from the date on which it was issued for acceptance unless one of the contracting parties has notified an obj@@ ection to its entry into force .
from that moment on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming the contracting party of the Additional Protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community any acceptance or obj@@ ection within the meaning of Article 2 and the time of entry into force of this Additional Protocol pursuant to Article 2 .
the Secretary @-@ General also noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any act , notification or notification in connection with this Convention .
consider that it is highly desirable if the member states support each other if necessary in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood group determination ,
whereas this mutual support is only possible if the constitution and use of these re@@ agents for blood group determination are submitted jointly by the Member States and the necessary facilities and exemp@@ tions for their import are granted -
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this agreement , the expression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group determination and to determine blood in@@ compatibility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to the determination of blood groups by signing this Agreement or when depos@@ iting its rati@@ fication , approval or accession notice by a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the declaration may be withdrawn at any time by a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the contracting parties undertake to leave re@@ agents for blood group determination against reimbur@@ sement of the costs of their extraction , preparation and carriage , as well as the purchase price of other contractual parties , which they urgently require , provided that they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are provided by other contracting parties only under the condition that no profit is associated with it that they are only used for medical purposes and are only supplied to designated bodies designated by the governments involved .
each shipment of re@@ agents for blood group identification must be accompanied by a certificate that they have been manufactured in accordance with the protocol regulations .
the Protocol and its system constitute an administrative arrangement that may be amended or amended by the governments of the contracting parties of this Convention .
the parties shall take all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents made available to them from other contracting parties for the determination of blood groups from all entrance fees .
they also take all necessary measures to ensure that these substances reach the shortest route indicated in Article 3 .
the parties shall submit a list of the places designated for the issu@@ ance of the certificate issued in Article 4 of the Council of Europe .
these bodies should be identical with the places designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
this Convention shall be signed for the members of the Council of Europe for signature ; they may become the contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ; or
this Convention enters into force one month after the date on which three members of the Council have rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it according to Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval .
for each member that is signed or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied by this Convention later without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , it enters into force one month after its signature or the deposit of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate .
pursuant to the entry into force of this Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the accompanying states a ) the time of entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this Convention , subject to a period of one year , by showing to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples containing an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not appear : a ) hä@@ mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be tested .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood circulation in the total volume .
anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object beam .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated at the time .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic floods .
the ti@@ ter gives di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , for the international standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( See Bulletin of O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ hear , according to definition , contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International laboratory for biological standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparing the international standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; Anti @-@ A Re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the tests by the government ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ us oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority can determine that an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic are added to the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) , provided that the re@@ agent has the conditions of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for the determination of blood groups must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ solved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments , gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups for the international exchange should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such quantities and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a vessel is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
adequate samples of all the re@@ agents are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective interest .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin .
on each individual container a black on white printed label is to be attached in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ activation ,
in addition , this label or label has the following information on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the use instructions attached to the containers : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed to recover ,
each shipment shall be accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention pursuant to the Annex to this Protocol .

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for determining the R@@ h group are possibly to change if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain an@@ tigen D but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .

sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies have to be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object carriers is determined in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than with the pro @-@ ha@@ ired antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .

the Parties to the European Convention of 14 May 1962 on the replacement of re@@ agents for blood group determination ( referred to as &quot; Con@@ ventions &quot; ) -
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracting parties shall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meet all the necessary measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to free the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion falls under the jurisdiction of the Community , which is based on the Treaty by which it has been established , which possesses the necessary powers ;
from this time on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming a contracting party of the Additional Protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community any acceptance or obj@@ ection within the meaning of Article 2 and the time of entry into force of this Additional Protocol pursuant to Article 2 .
the Secretary @-@ General also noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any act , notification or notification in connection with this Convention .

based on the Joint Declaration adopted by the ministers of the EF@@ TA countries and the Member States of the Community as well as from the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 , which contains a call for the creation of a European Economic Area , in particular in terms of simpli@@ fication of the border and country of origin ,
in the event that the Community decided to strengthen the internal market within the programme of action to strengthen the internal market , effective January 1 , 1988 , a uniform administration paper was introduced .
in the weighing that it is appropriate to simplify the promotion of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a single administrative paper ,
in the weighing that this Convention shall not be interpreted in passing , that it un@@ locks the contracting parties from their obligations under other international agreements ;
in this Convention Meas@@ ures are set to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; this includes , in particular , a unified management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a single paper ) , which is to be used irrespective of the nature and origin of the goods for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) between the contracting parties .
the in@@ convenience connected with the goods transport between the contracting parties shall be carried out by means of a single paper , for which pre @-@ print@@ ings according to the patterns in Annex I to this Convention are to be used .
the single paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping or import .
- to be expressly requested to carry out the legal provisions applicable in a contracting party whose application would not be guaranteed in the sole use of the unity paper ;
- requested by the parties , so that they may be able to come to the enjoyment of a part or a certain facil@@ itation .
( 1 ) The agreement does not prevent the contracting parties from applying simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further simpli@@ fication for the parties involved .
( 2 ) simplified procedures can in particular fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not subject to a customs office and that the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be admitted .
in these cases , an application must subsequently be filed , with the consent of the competent authorities in order to act as a peri@@ odic collective application within the deadline established by these authorities .
in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use trading papers instead of a single paper .
