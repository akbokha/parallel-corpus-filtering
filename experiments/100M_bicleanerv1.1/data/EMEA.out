the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations on the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ r thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where the patients have alternating periods of abnormal mood alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to inhal@@ e or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines same as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the transmission of signals between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to one another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as a &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less measure than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
because dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their re@@ occurring .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recurring symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent re@@ occurrence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb ( as@@ simil@@ ates ) .
in the two trials with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15@@ mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than those who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
for up to 74 weeks , A@@ bili@@ fy ret@@ ali@@ ated more effectively than plac@@ ebo to restore man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy @-@ inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness more effectively than plac@@ ebo and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common A@@ bili@@ fy side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ checked bite ) , ac@@ ath@@ isie ( constant motion ) , nausea , nausea , s@@ ali@@ va hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with mainly man@@ ic episodes , out@@ weighing the man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
moreover , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the launch of A@@ bili@@ fy in the whole European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mostly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes were referred to in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages exceeding a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dosage .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the replacement of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ac and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate an M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ phen@@ ol , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central active drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of absorption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism can result in a combined application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l than C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose level before the beginning of the companion therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
due to the insufficient data position for the safety of humans and the concerns arising in the reproduction studies of the animal , this drug may not be used during pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of more than 52 weeks , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , occurred in patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and 13.@@ 1 % for patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was seen in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with lanz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23@@ ,5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients undergoing treatment of hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study , over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study period more than 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were observed , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
elev@@ ations of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or intentionally acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is of benefit in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ ors and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor lig@@ and , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ name .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a semi @-@ operation dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents &apos; response was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ A@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the response rate was found for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ kl@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy comparable to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy comparable to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features that were not associated with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was thinking about the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al age is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in extensive metabolism of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours with &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre @-@ clinical data could not detect any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning to clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in women with the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - arith@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys are well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses that led to positions of 3 and 11 times of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should continue with the same dose .

hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ kl@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l as a solution to take 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l into tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max level of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses that led to positions of 3 and 11 times of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and begin with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine regarding A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy fusion tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed regarding extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ac and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and indication of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ phen@@ ol , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that after all@@ otted application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15@@ mg dose ) was used in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly as a single @-@ pa@@ it@@ or and who were at the same time receiving Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of absorption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism can result in a combined application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose level before the beginning of the companion therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that after all@@ otted application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solutions ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % for patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another study , over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term study period more than 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were observed , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
elev@@ ations of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ oral distur@@ b@@ ance was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution combined with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of toxic@@ ity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as obesity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms in relation to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased patient number .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a semi @-@ operation dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents &apos; response was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the response rate was significantly higher for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ kl@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which were not associated with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was thinking about the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger in the first 2 hours after injection of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular to 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application no safety @-@ related concern after mat@@ ernal exposure was found , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre @-@ clinical data could not detect any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning to clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits following dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which three quarters previously had received anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatment of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in addition , it may not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before or before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited Company for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent runs .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dosage must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there have been no studies conducted with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no sufficient data to suggest dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ artic@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
patients should not be dischar@@ ged again , until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils are increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated car@@ dio toxic@@ ity was not proven in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in the event of nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea in patients following the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ co@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ pation .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or for women in child@@ bearing age that do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ tion method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to make no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised to have sperm con@@ served before treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect transport efficiency and ability to operate machinery .
listed below are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , adverse events are reported which have occurred in combination with Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ ine hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the thor@@ ax wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , her@@ nia pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , back pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection with a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the concentration of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ as and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ ei@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( cream protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two random@@ ised un@@ banned studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III trial .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metastatic breast cells .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic breast cancer and 19 % for metastatic breast cancer and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to termin@@ ate at bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
exposure to drugs ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After an intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dose ( 43 % ) than a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose , with less than 1 % of the Met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
however , only a few data are available to patients aged over 75 years of age , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances , caution should be taken when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , it is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid into a sterili@@ sed water bottle .
after complete addition of the solution , the defl@@ ector should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the pi@@ cker should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete reset of the powder is done .

member states must ensure that the owner of the marketing department supplies the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials before the market launch :
• Training instruction • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging . • With clear visual representation of the correct application of the product provided cold boxes for the transport by patients .
this means that ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal drugs &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications may arise in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion if a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is not possible prior to the procedure .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders indicated by the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
when administered as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference medicinal product .
all participating patients had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before they were either renamed to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between the weeks 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed inj@@ ected under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients treated to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as in those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients still receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the European Union regulations , it has been proved that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the transport of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirement in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general state ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , with planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml should not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ mpt@@ omas and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose that is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous administration if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , sex , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose needed to control the an@@ emia symptoms .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ inal number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the incidence of re@@ tic@@ u@@ cy@@ tes &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l are increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ ular zy@@ me is increased by ≥ 000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the incidence of re@@ tic@@ u@@ cy@@ tes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value is an all@@ usion to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be stopped .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , should be maintained twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or programme , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
on this occasion , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively given 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients who suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) under the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin should not receive a se@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in patients with greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous don@@ or program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pro@@ s , accompanying or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial hyper@@ tension , vascular disease of the oti@@ oti@@ d or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently received heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the presence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the residual value should be determined and the usual causes for a failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ um@@ xi@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the residual value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ litre or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration recommended in section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical trials , an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed if er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ogen@@ ous active substances ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the application of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the an@@ emia symptoms and avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded with maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumor patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response should be taken into account in the evaluation of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ missible ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment for patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient , who should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients with greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly before the start of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis because they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl there is an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events .
in several controlled studies epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
on th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events like m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , re@@ ins thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ c events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
independent of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ u@@ ine patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ is and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ og@@ lob@@ es ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 m@@ amma @-@ carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) .

survival and progression of tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to controls due to various common malign@@ omas .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa conditions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved by intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years ago , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) .
14 In animal @-@ experimental studies with approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose recommended in humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced feder@@ ated body weight , a delay in the oscill@@ ation and a rise in fet@@ al mortality .

prior to the launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the owner of the marketing authorization must provide medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training instruction • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging .
the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application has been set up and functioning before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine is administered in the transport .
the owner of the risk management agreement is oblig@@ ated to carry out the trials and additional measures concerning the pharmac@@ eu@@ vig@@ il@@ ance indicated in the Pharmaceuticals Li@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan pursuant to version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. in accordance with each subsequent risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use &quot; at the same time as the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • on receiving new information that may have an impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , pharmac@@ eu@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • mil@@ estones within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction )
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or reinforced chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in the veins ( deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) , for example , if such an atro@@ phy has occurred earlier .
you suffer from serious circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial hyper@@ tension ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which will recover after further treatment .
your doctor may , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dissolution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be taken into account and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before the start of therapy .
very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia following months to many years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will break your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising levels of potassium , your doctor may take into account an interruption of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values lie back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion sign by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of the an@@ amed blood with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the efficacy of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your levels of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly in order to keep the risk of blood cl@@ umping ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patients , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed can act like a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances may have a negative impact on the tumour .
if larger or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic surgery is available to you , pre @-@ treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed should be the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ oning after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have used / used other medicines or used it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedy for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , stro@@ kes , transi@@ ent circulation disturbances of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , lung em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm , vascular extensions ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ e@@ dem@@ a ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when using ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood @-@ drop formation ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ) .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ) when your initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or if you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
if a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must either be used within 3 days or be dis@@ car@@ ded .
ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like the ho@@ of ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , Ac@@ ton@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ ton@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate ac@@ last@@ a .
the first study involved almost 8@@ ,000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was studied for a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was studied for a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , in two studies , ac@@ last@@ a was tested in 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood returned norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ed@@ dy frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years in patients suffering from ac@@ last@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients suffering from ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ ton@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ ton@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ last@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney complaints , reactions at the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ se ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ ton@@ a provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited Company a permit for the placing of ac@@ last@@ a across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ation in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy eating • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of acet@@ one in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for treating the disease Pa@@ get , ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease patho@@ gen Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the disease patho@@ gen Pa@@ get with ac@@ last@@ a a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ up@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring in the first three days after the administration of acet@@ one may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of acet@@ one .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as this patient population has limited clinical experience .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with ac@@ last@@ a prior to treatment with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be examined before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
for patients need@@ ing dental intervention , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring in the first three days after the administration of acet@@ one may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of acet@@ one ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of suspected cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving ac@@ last@@ a ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which manifested itself as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ state and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo , compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were up to 2.3 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials .
in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of acet@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions at the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been studied , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which have been treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area with an ac@@ last@@ a and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the case of over@@ dose leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be compensated by adding oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( Sty@@ ria ) once a year for 3 consecutive years was observed in post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density T @-@ T ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the cock@@ le dog ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric body frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ rates frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ last@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures by 60 % compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a lasting effect over three years , resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) ac@@ last@@ a significantly increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip by 6.0 % , of the cervi@@ cal area by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic region .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular mes@@ hing volume and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone structure compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of study .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of Ac@@ up@@ a reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ gage was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the treatment of ac@@ last@@ a compared to plac@@ ebo treatment increased the BM@@ D at the overall pen@@ al and the she@@ ar neck at all points of time .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment , the ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total frac@@ tures and 4.3 % in the cervi@@ cal area compared to plac@@ ebo treatment .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to reduce clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , an annual dose of ac@@ last@@ a compared to once weekly of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not subject to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with the disease patho@@ gen Pa@@ get of the bone is studied in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all mild to moderate severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
in combination with combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influ@@ encing was observed after 6 months compared to bas@@ eline for ac@@ last@@ a and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ ders at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a compared to 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting , very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ phase dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elim@@ bation period with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of separation ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total @-@ body clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clearance of the metaboli@@ zed substances by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no more direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 studied patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
there are no statements available for severe kidney dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only .
acute toxic@@ ity The maximum non let@@ ally acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in mice .
for studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was determined in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated exc@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common finding in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ phi@@ c effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages starting from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum @-@ calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is constructed in an un@@ ordered manner , which weak@@ ens the bone material than normal .
ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , ensuring normal bone formation and thus re@@ taining strength to the bone .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with ac@@ last@@ a .
when using ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have used / used other medicines or used it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using ac@@ last@@ a together with foods and drinks , you may be concerned that you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with acet@@ a according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster the dose of ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
as ac@@ last@@ a is working for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood does not become too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , ac@@ last@@ a can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ pay@@ a is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before finishing the treatment with Ac@@ ton@@ a Falls , please consider your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion very often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days of the administration of ac@@ last@@ a .
at the moment , it is unclear whether Ac@@ ton@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received ac@@ last@@ a .

allergic reactions including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) have been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a patients need to be provided with sufficient fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically slow , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or that are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies were carried out to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which AC@@ accompli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for smoking compared to a plac@@ ebo .
however , the studies showing smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of accompli@@ sh@@ ments was difficult to assess in this field of application .
the most common side effects of accompli@@ a , which were noted during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and may cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable with the simultaneous use of drug drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for the use in HIV infection ) , t@@ eli@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or clari@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of compli@@ a with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing re@@ conn@@ aissance packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - in addition to obesity - have no recognis@@ able risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons must point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

in addition , patients with obesity have examined overweight patients as well as in patients with more than 3@@ 800 patients .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects that occurred during treatment in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated with weight reduction and accompanying metabolic diseases .
if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for adverse effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In evaluating side effects the following frequencies are based :
very often ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasional ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä
in a case study where a limited number of people were given a dose of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a simultaneous hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
n weight reduction after one year was 20@@ mg of 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

5.3 Pre@@ cious clinical data for safety @-@ related adverse events that have not been observed in clinical studies but occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area have been evaluated as potentially relevant for the clinical application :
in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no adverse effects on the fertility or cycle disturbances were observed .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with a different di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ( dual therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ an@@ ide or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl hard or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl hard or insulin can be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , which makes it better to adjust type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was assessed in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in containing a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ and , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos lead to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c factor , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ in decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos additionally reported a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( decreased sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that in the course of a mon@@ otherapy ( for the sole use ) , Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Bar@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited permission to transport Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is inadequate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treating with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output h@@ ep@@ atic values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes must be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes must be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should continue , should be directed to the clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters have been exceeded .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparison of controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and a lesser extent in patients with sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ cell or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ an@@ ide or as a dual combination therapy with insulin can reduce the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , a reduction in visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ons including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or a wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but con@@ cor@@ dant doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative drug therapy .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and should a patient wish to be pregnant or enter , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
drug interactions which are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the reduction of the mother &apos;s insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance resulting from pregnancy and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( cannot be estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary alteration of the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents often performed the three times the upper limit of the standard range as often as in plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ants .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was respectively .
since the market launch rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in treated groups .
in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative drug therapy .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to function via a activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients with blood sugar were random@@ ly assigned to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo in spite of three months of optimization with insulin .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
clinical trials over a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to initial values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as negli@@ gi@@ bly but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels have been observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant rise in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
following oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in approximately thre@@ ef@@ old the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the decay ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agree on repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the reduction in hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the plac@@ ental under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ons resulted in increased frequency of color@@ ec@@ tal tum@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative drug therapy .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated .
clinical trials over 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the goal of its primary end@@ point , which provided a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kl@@ es , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vit@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were lowered similarly strongly as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
also , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane have to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily if rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood glucose level has improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia risk symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosing or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients for other medications taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in an un@@ controlled diabetes care , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent brain functions and even death .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , however , can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the effective maximum is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the total effective duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional safety mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id cannot be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
also , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id have to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin quickly acting must first be taken up , then the amount of insulin &apos;s long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tro@@ pl@@ aid reduced the mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( ages 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ o@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or arthritis ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ at@@ crystalline deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there are still some cases of g@@ ob@@ bling ; it is therefore recommended that patients receive further medicines at least during the first six months under treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had organ transplantation as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ o@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
both studies used Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol in a dose of once daily 300 mg . patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid level was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily took 120 mg , received a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients taking plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include head@@ aches , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea , skin rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in pri@@ mor@@ dial de@@ bris ( including a present case of rheum@@ atism and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum level of serum levels is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents have no experience in children and adolescents , but the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other drugs @-@ containing drugs , acute toxic@@ ity may occur during the course of treatment , because the lowering of the serum resin acid pi@@ p@@ eg@@ um can first mobili@@ se ur@@ ic acid sedi@@ ments in the tissue .
B . in the case of malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine is likely to increase so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
during phase 3 clinical studies slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of the treatment and further course ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was no interaction studies conducted on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects were associated with a simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg twice daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e.com ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or other active ingredient applied at the same time .
in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a tan@@ ta@@ sis , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not cause side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 either at all or with lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ an@@ aes@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness of breath , rash , kidney failure , erectile dysfunction , increase of TS@@ H concentration in blood , decline in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
the active mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and is produced as part of the hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid reaction process .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro in@@ hibition which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three months of serum levels were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

in view of lowering the serum resin acid level below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .

lowering the serum resin cutter to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and remained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. , h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage reg@@ ression of the serum resin concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT ) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of toxic cases ( i.e. more than 3 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ asi@@ fication ) in the months 16 to 24 .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the toxic@@ ity , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the toxic@@ ity up to 24 months .
higher TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ L / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses are proportional .
for cans between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2,8 to 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage drop in serum resin concentration if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly arises through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in urine was found as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C by F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7,5 μ g in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
in high doses , which were about 4,@@ 3 times the human@@ istic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which was accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with expos@@ ures that were about 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with expos@@ ures that were about 13 times the human@@ istic exposure showed no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already being used apart from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those receiving al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include head@@ aches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , sor@@ es ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , stiff@@ ening abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdominal ) and aci@@ dic uph@@ eav@@ als .
for patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be used in es@@ oph@@ agus disorders , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .

capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , characterized by the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• After getting up the day AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or cr@@ ush the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations . • Pati@@ ents should not present themselves before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al el@@ zer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some of them were seriously and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , and patients should be advised to take out the medicine when symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ icious heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while there was no increased risk in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , some of which were severe and complications , were rarely reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly contain intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there is no data available which indicates whether the insertion of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients need@@ ing a lower surgical procedure decreases the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ar@@ sis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment plan for each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , they should take the tablet the next morning after notic@@ ing their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the dose of one tablet a week as originally planned on the designated day of the week .
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the beginning of therapy .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken into clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ar@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports are from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis is reported as well .
nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ um took up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ates up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at in@@ contin@@ ence of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or el@@ zer@@ a .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group below AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) in the group under al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
the therapeutic equi@@ val@@ ence of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ centre study in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III trials , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo reached 8.@@ 8 % in the verteb@@ ral column , 5.@@ 9 % in the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in patients who suffered one or several ed@@ dy frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D climb@@ s of the verteb@@ ral column and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter still continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
absorption At an intraven@@ ous dose of reference , the medi@@ an oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before the intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability declined accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distri@@ butions of rats revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ated in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After an intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the decay .
following IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and systemic clearance exceeded 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .
res@@ or@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) following noc@@ tur@@ nal fast and two hours before intake of a meal , the middle surface below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 is 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng / h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D3 level ) .
mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and medi@@ an@@ age until the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) was 12 hours .
in the liver , vitamin D3 is hydro@@ xy@@ ulated in the liver quickly to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ di@@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion At the administration of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D3 in healthy volunteers , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the decay after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .

as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and investigated , as Adv@@ ant@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and transplantation of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medication or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained .
the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ ine should primarily be based on clinical assessment of punc@@ ture and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood sample regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
following the conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ c should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after the conversion .
on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as tal@@ low , was comparable with both ven@@ eer and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ c levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t taking into paragraph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the article can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral taking of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be induced intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the preparation of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The or@@ ale advance therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be required later because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The or@@ ale advance therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f must be converted to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs to Adv@@ ant@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose , recommended in both kidney and liver transplan@@ t , must begin with the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplantation In adult patients treated to Adv@@ ant@@ ages , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with patients in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation , was used in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in case of pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood @-@ tal mirrors in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose may be required .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine reception and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ter to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full @-@ blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to perform common checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ c during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic examinations during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after switching from pro@@ gra@@ f to advance , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ancement is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur in consequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is available .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ant@@ f .
due to possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies should be avoided during a treatment with advance ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , especially careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations .
in rare cases an aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy could be observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ant@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ loading and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin alterations due to suitable clothes or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as Adv@@ ant@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ ass , ret@@ ar@@ ert , lac@@ tose present , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary g@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain constant concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels results primarily from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially l@@ essen the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of patients with transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in the uter@@ o exposition we recommend monitoring of the new@@ born to possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ alkal@@ ine ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines .
the side effects are listed below : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , known as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus which often increases suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of the BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ant@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ties including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sible .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level should medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ related in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain range of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ c@@ ine genes .

175 l@@ ung@@ mut@@ ated patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis on a recent , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans were compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplantation following a random@@ ised procedure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation The published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after col@@ on transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations which lead to an increase in the un@@ linked faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly via bile .
in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ ant@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform common checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ c during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic examinations during maintenance therapy .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of use depends on whether Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but manufactured using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell containing a gene ( DNA ) that enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is another medicine approved in the European Union named Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , Adv@@ ate &apos;s efficacy in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages was evaluated in 86 % of 510 new blood counts with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of Adv@@ ate in the whole European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ aging events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the appropriate period does not fall under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the VI@@ II plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in response to factor VI@@ II , different in vivo reg@@ aining and different half @-@ time periods .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for the long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the rate of administration should be adjusted according to the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) versus Factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always tested against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma with modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ory development , re@@ combin@@ ant VI@@ II @-@ product re@@ combin@@ ant inhibit@@ ors were observed after switching from one re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there is no experience concerning the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s used in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirrors in plasma as well as the clearance rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) had detected a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pren@@ atal , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still rated the benefit risk assessment as positive but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should request another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , officially announced that the company receives its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically altered to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enable cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene , which is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and split .
the company presented data from a study with a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs in the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in &apos;s injection into Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notify the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified active release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms , except con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients receiving aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients with aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , ti@@ redness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients that are resistant to adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary or vascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge caused by cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit to transport aer@@ op@@ lanes across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as with long @-@ term usage the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease over time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after such treatment .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ li@@ de , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be attributed per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a dimin@@ ishing Rhin@@ o drug ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient group and the data does not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data did not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that treatment should be reduced by hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the head@@ aches ) .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be de@@ posed for at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether or not it was alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies revealed no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that very rare cases may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impair@@ ment of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , t@@ rem@@ or , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ce .
head@@ aches , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , aspir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ dial pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is especially likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il di@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the expression of the adhesion @-@ cell P @-@ Selec@@ tor on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , the lost 5 m@@ g. did not affect standard measurement values of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can produce other sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine for the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of an@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the plasma was administered .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four volunteers underwent mal@@ nutrition .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on conventional safety mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and lac@@ t@@ ating or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .

for children aged one to five years , the dosage is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and respectively .
for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by calcul@@ ating the change in the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ri@@ ls , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ e and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the number of symptoms ( symptom number ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the number of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe Enterprise a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms end and at their re@@ occurrence .
the persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and Al@@ co@@ hol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impair@@ ment of transport efficiency or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg , compared to patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) was given .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion @-@ cell P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ ine on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a clinical study with multiple doses given in des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was given a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no prolon@@ gation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement values of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
as hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that in addition to the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ ef@@ ulness significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for ass@@ essing these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal hypo@@ aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular danger to humans .

eri@@ us can be taken irrespective of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 ) and that there is no data that support a treatment of a infectious a@@ eri@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin investigations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age are fully metaboli@@ zed ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this drug contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study in adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age used for anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily di@@ chlor@@ ate dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years old ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no prolon@@ gation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not cause impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol resulted in neither the increase in alcohol @-@ induced deterioration of the performance nor an increase in sleep@@ iness .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully metaboli@@ zed phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) through des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant drug therapies after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single @-@ dose studies , the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ Max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ in@@ let bottles with child @-@ proof polypropylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate once a day to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets at the recommended dose of 5 mg , compared to patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study used up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) .
in two single @-@ dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated and documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no prolon@@ gation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a 17 single @-@ dose study with adults , the lost 5 m@@ g. did not affect standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dosage of the melt tablet can be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
overall frequency of adverse events between the ab@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us mel@@ ted tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet form@@ ulations and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for cap@@ turing des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in a single dose study with adults , the lost 5 m@@ g. did not affect standard measurement values of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly metaboli@@ zed phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than with ch@@ ewing gum ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single @-@ dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets have not been studied in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with the dosage studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ c@@ ch@@ ase is@@ om@@ al@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most commonly reported adverse events were diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no adverse events were observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 at a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the recommended doses , plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .

after the launch of A@@ eri@@ us it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) and skin rash .
A@@ eri@@ us solution for admission is indicated for children between 1 and 11 years , teenagers ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution is attached to an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling , you can alternatively use it to take the appropriate amount of solution for intake .
regarding the duration of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you suffer from and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution for taking .
however , in children under 2 years of diarr@@ ho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia frequent side effects were reported more often than with plac@@ ebo in adults .
97 A@@ erial solution for inser@@ ting is available in bottles with child @-@ safe closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml packaging size is a measuring spoon or an application injection f@@ û@@ r preparations for use with sc@@ aling of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company has withdrawn its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the stem ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is supposed to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from man to person because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane envelope of the virus was separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a foreign body ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution for inhal@@ ation , but it cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
a gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood was that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ spar@@ ase is based on body weight .
ast@@ er@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood while taking in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , fortified with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ veri@@ fiable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load change after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than in plac@@ ebo , but was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , the viral load was also reduced in children , but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of ather@@ os@@ clerosis ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
generic ase may also not be used in patients who take up the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are degra@@ ded just as ag@@ or@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines against HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ a are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs , the benefits of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years were out@@ weigh the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of a@@ or@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generic ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because for scientific reasons only limited information was available at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a licence to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited company for the transport of generic gases across the European Union .
generic ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , am@@ en@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be performed taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore , ag@@ ro@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not replac@@ eable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ or@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If ag@@ or@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying additive of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of ag@@ or@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ag@@ or@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ast@@ er@@ ase combined with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
con@@ current application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function problems , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ lic@@ um 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r while taking amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ eg@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , am@@ en@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy combined with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have an increased risk of serious side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
in case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ id that is metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of am@@ en@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , am@@ er@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amp@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should be monitored by op@@ pi@@ ate removal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ e content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under four years of age and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set for 5 days if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other illnesses to which therapy medicines were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer persistent anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune deficiency , anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical condition or deterioration of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long@@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medi@@ ums with low therapeutic width a@@ or@@ ase may not be given at the same time as medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ asy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width a@@ or@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose active substances are mainly transferred via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for increased plasma levels .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of amp@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to equ@@ alize the degra@@ ding plasma level by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , unwanted effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ hea and , if possible , check the viral load and replace the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by contrast , reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pe@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan .
52 % lower if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the in@@ viol@@ able component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , when using E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin caused an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with an ast@@ er@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ast@@ er@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can potentially lead to interactions when used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with an ag@@ or@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as ag@@ or@@ ase as it may result in absorption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amp@@ avi@@ r .
the serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin .
con@@ current consumption with ast@@ er@@ ase can significantly increase plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100@@ mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of ag@@ or@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced elev@@ ations of the plasma levels are to be expected while ad@@ minist@@ ering A@@ gener@@ a .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug is not recommended with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while adding amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with an oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is advisable to use par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicates a possible rise in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored by op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as to how to adjust the dose of the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r when administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not pre@@ dict@@ ably , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful observation of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time adding a gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether or not amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by the em@@ bodi@@ ment in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
further development of the offspring including fertility and reproduction capability was not impaired by the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the ast@@ er@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely lead to break@@ age .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ a or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and bilateral sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation ( j@@ aw@@ s ) .
among 113 anti @-@ retro@@ viral people treated with amp@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , there were 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes of skin were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ qu@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immunity , anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common to those who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures are to be initiated .

the 50 % hem@@ or@@ oh@@ m concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r therapy schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , with which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance samples similar to those in adults .

the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic assessment systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern generates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data about cross resistance between amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral therapies in which a fossi@@ ls @-@ avi@@ r @-@ containing pattern failed ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which pre @-@ treated adult after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly used with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis noted the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ suffici@@ ency threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , an ast@@ er@@ ase solution for intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg was three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ or@@ ase should be taken into account in the treatment of therapy with PI previously treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the middle duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by contrast , reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by dietary intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of the blood stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentrations in the steady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of ag@@ or@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
the solution is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore , the A@@ gener@@ ase solution and the ag@@ or@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the impact of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amp@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment regi@@ mens lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels similar to those obtained in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and therapeu@@ tical application , showed little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ vent@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen , nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ re@@ ase nor by the end of the treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to a therapeutic dose in humans , however , there were observed a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us on@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate a delayed development .
24 If ag@@ or@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying additive of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of ag@@ or@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ag@@ or@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
con@@ current application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or slight liver function problems , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
am@@ en@@ ase should be removed in the duration of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ related factors , such as a longer persistent anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of amp@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by contrast , reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pe@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with a gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will fall to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .

in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100@@ mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % and respectively .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by the em@@ bodi@@ ment in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures are to be initiated .
an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro tested against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % hem@@ or@@ o@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ or@@ ase should be taken into account in the treatment of therapy with PI previously treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the metabolism path@@ ways are not fully mature enough , so that amp@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .

the bio@@ availability of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore , ag@@ ro@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not replac@@ eable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of an ast@@ er@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ ic content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for taking small children and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this drug and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ eg@@ ase does not prevent 47 of the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .

con@@ current consumption with ast@@ er@@ ase can significantly increase plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increases plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral dosing of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . due to the possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the propylene gly@@ col , the potential risk for taking may not be applied during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether or not amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • For patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between treatment cycles .
the cream must be applied to the affected skin areas in a thin layer prior to bed@@ time , so that it remains on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested for 16 weeks in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks and performed Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo on a daily basis or five times a week .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • Dur@@ ing the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the full healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to be continued until all visible tendencies in the genital or per@@ ine@@ al area have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are cured only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual treatment plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is to be applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed in the clean@@ sed , moist@@ ur@@ ising skin until the cream is completely absorbed .
these patients should take a balance between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
these patients should take a balance between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the associated risk of organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a circumcision leading to circumcision were observed .
in the case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in higher than recommended doses an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or resulted in temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied means for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ine@@ al regions there are currently no clinical experience .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the tendencies .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be evaluated after the regeneration of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data is currently available for long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip area .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream .
if the local skin reactions are causing great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study revealed that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ ating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not produce any direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither the quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were quanti@@ fied after a one @-@ time top@@ ical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most common adverse events in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the treatment of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with side effects include discomfort on the site of application with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common adverse events , probably or possibly , with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the testing plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , it is common to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cur@@ ori@@ ation / leaves / di@@ shed ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , the clinical signs showed that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream applied very often to serious er@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and heavy swe@@ ating and shor@@ tages ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed at the centre of treatment or the surrounding area with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) .
the in@@ adver@@ tent oral absorption of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
clin@@ ically serious side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete eradic@@ ation of the hands during an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment .
60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated patients fully ; this was in 20 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) in 20 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo :
full healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic action l@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ e@@ as@@ iness of the scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the permitted indications External F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be demonstrated in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three @-@ week weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0,1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that after top@@ ical application , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s res@@ or@@ ption was low in patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the current toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application revealed no similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with the oral administration on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ours in the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for humans to look at because of systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice that were treated with the non @-@ active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( gen@@ itali@@ a ) and anus ( after ) ● super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
if left untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore , early detection and treatment are important .
ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their life .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in case of flat ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osen in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream promotes your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection .
O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about this before you start treatment . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until the area to be treated is bot@@ tled after a previous drug or surgical treatment .
in case of accidental contact , remove the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o Do not use more cream than your doctor had prescribed you . o Do not apply cream as your doctor had prescribed you . o If reactions occur in the treated area , which cause you severe discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water .
as soon as the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment .
if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulty in pulling off the fores@@ kin can be expected with increased incidence of pre @-@ skin con@@ stric@@ tions .
do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or inside the anus ( anus ) .
taking other medications have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle .
if you have intercourse with cow@@ war@@ ts in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is to be carried out .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently used it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
do not breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream because it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine sur@@ passes into breast milk .
the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in cases of inclin@@ ation , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application ) .
apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the cow@@ sheds and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed .
men with cow@@ ards below the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath it ( see section 2 &quot; What do you have to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you feel uncomfortable during the Al@@ dar@@ a cream application .
in case your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause a blue stain to occur sooner or later , or it can cause ti@@ redness .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
mostly these are lighter skin reactions that res@@ ound within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed .
occasionally , some patients may notice changes in the site of application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , tumour formation , skin disorders , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .
occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location ( blood , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , loss of pain or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , sore throat , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , sore throat , facial swelling , ul@@ c@@ ers , lim@@ b pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme treatment in patients with a safe diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that make movements more difficult , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a physician who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced G@@ AG concentrations in urine by around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion point .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year and , where necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme action therapy in patients with a safe diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be performed by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effects that arise during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where rehabilitation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , expect nearly all patients to form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , it must be cau@@ ti@@ ously preceded by the theore@@ tically elevated risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment .
pre@@ treatment 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of an easy or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate during which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single serious in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate during which the reaction occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk is present , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 trial ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their length@@ ening of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are found in the following table following the following abund@@ ances : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions were also observed , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing mal@@ function and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , whereby the patients at the age of 5 were treated with a more severe form of a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 trial ( or up to an early departure from the study ) , there were no antibodies which were det@@ ectable by Radio@@ immunity ( R@@ IP ) in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients , in which there was never a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels found a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in urine while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ing effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or decrease of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme action therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circul@@ atory system and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire spectrum of diseases , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute minimum distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to perform in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel was established in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account both clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal Fe@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of movement of the Sh@@ oul@@ der joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted to investigate the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe con@@ ges@@ tion form and 4 with middle course ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was observed following the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with a severe form of decay ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe con@@ ges@@ tion only limited or no advances in cognitive development were to be observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walking test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety and toxic@@ ity studies , toxic@@ ity , and toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify specific dangers to humans .
since no toler@@ ability studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except with the ones listed under 6.@@ 6 .
if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that the di@@ lution has been effected under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

within the given period , the owner of the marketing authorization must complete the following program of studies , the results of which form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ is@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase is found , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you take medicines containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished action of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken medicine , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ IX @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions arose , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing mal@@ function and facial oils .
very common ( more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • joint disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion spot
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the package supplement will be updated .
if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that the di@@ lution has been effected under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient the number of pi@@ erc@@ ing bottles to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer versus cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and fluids should be given before or after the addition of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) before or after the addition of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , removed or the dose is reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ ry thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ ric in its active form is easier in canc@@ er@@ ous cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural or@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.2 months compared to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , medi@@ an survival with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival compared to the comparison medicine when ad@@ minist@@ ering A@@ lim@@ ta .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
each flow bottle has to be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 m@@ l. ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with either advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is given as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
for reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the emet@@ ric administration and on the day after the treatment .
at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken during the seven days before the first dose of water mixed and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first real @-@ time fixed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving psychiat@@ ric readings , a complete blood sample should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose check has to take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria are consistent with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ level 3 ( except for neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity occurs 3 or 4 in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ tes or so@@ - in the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients with 65 years of age or over 65 years of age when compared to patients aged under 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min there were no dose adjustments that go beyond the dosage adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 0.2 times the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ ital os@@ upp@@ ression , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again reach a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tic value has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in level 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ o@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was rejected if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ ry must be reli@@ eved to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid simultaneous use of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with water @-@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for whom a tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment is provided must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with water @-@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with psychiat@@ ric signals if this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since there is the possibility of ir@@ reversible effects of the reproductive capacity of tel@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised in front of the treatment centre to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced emet@@ ry separation with the result of increased incidence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to use high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with tel@@ emet@@ ry ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the cl@@ ot@@ ting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for use of tel@@ emet@@ ry in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ ry should not be used during pregnancy except if absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there is a possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity of tel@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ tainment .
it is not known whether water mixed in breast milk and unwanted effects on breast@@ feeding inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who were random@@ ised to receive tel@@ emet@@ ry , included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the conden@@ sed results of 3 individual mixed mono therapy studies ( n = 164 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead back to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 trials included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC , which were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and tel@@ emet@@ ran@@ ate and received 8@@ 30 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC , which were random@@ ised to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients before , during or after their emet@@ ric treatment ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ sequence that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that tel@@ emet@@ ry works as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking thy@@ me dro@@ logical kin@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ us@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural or@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit to survival compared to those patients who were only d@@ elt with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) in the treatment arm .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural or@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the only c@@ is@@ pl@@ et@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a loss of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months for patients receiving doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plat@@ el@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separate random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ ric use ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
medi@@ al PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adapted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 3@@ 0,@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3,@@ 9 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) .
the analysis of the impact of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in accordance with hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = outline interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ suffici@@ ency limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te transport ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients required the application of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18,@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed after application as a mon@@ o@@ therapeutic agent were examined in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion areas .
tel@@ emet@@ ry is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine within 24 hours of the application .
tel@@ emet@@ ry fixed a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs that received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( degeneration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the epitheli@@ al tissue ) .
unless otherwise excell@@ ently applied , storage times and conditions after preparation are the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
solve the content of 100 mg vi@@ me@@ x bottles with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preservatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml water mixed .
the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the product .
each flow bottle has to be dissolved with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
23 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with psychiat@@ ric signals if this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg powder for the production of a concentrated solution A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg powder for the production of a concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who received no previous chemotherapy to treat the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural tube ( malign@@ ant disease of the ri@@ bs ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer .
if you have kidney disease or previously had one , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmacy , as you may not be allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
you will be carried out before any in@@ fusion of blood tests ; it checks whether your kidney or liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may possibly change the dose or stop the treatment as long as it requires your general condition and if your blood levels are too low .
if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medications to avoid vom@@ iting before and after c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
if there is a liquid retention collection around the lungs , your doctor may decide to remove this liquid before you receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
if you would like to bear a child during treatment or during the first 6 months after the treatment , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
drug interactions Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) such as such medicines called &quot; non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ aco &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , including medicines that are not prescription ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
depending on the planned roof@@ ing of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take and when .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
a hospital pharmacy , the nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with a sterile 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you .
your doctor will prescri@@ be you cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( corresponding to 4 mg of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ a son twice daily ) , which you must take on the day before , during and after the day after the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will prescri@@ be fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) for inhal@@ ing or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain fo@@ lic acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you have to take daily while using A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
in the week before the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and about every 9 weeks ( corresponding to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this information leaf@@ let , this means that it was reported to at least 1 out of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this means that it was reported to at least 1 out of 100 patients but reported less than 1 out of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a side effect is described as &quot; occasional &quot; - this suggests that it was reported from at least 1 out of 1,000 but less than 1 out of 100 patients . this means that it was reported by at least 1 out of 10,000 but less than 1 out of 1,000 patients .
fever or infection ( often ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or above , swe@@ ating or have other signs of an infection ( because you may then have fewer white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) .
if you feel tired or weak , get into short@@ ness of breath or look pale ( because you may have less hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in than normal , which is very common ) .
if you have a bleeding g@@ ums , nose or mouth or any other bleeding which does not come to a halt , or have a red@@ dish or pink urine or unexpected blood stream ( because you may have less blood plat@@ el@@ ets than normal , which is very common ) .
occasionally ( occurs in at least 1 out of 1,000 patients , but less than 1 of 100 patients ) increased pulse rate co@@ li@@ tis ( inflammation of the inner lining of the col@@ on that can be associated with bleeding in the gut and end@@ gut ) inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis ( leaving of water into the body tissues that leads to swelling ) .
rare ( occurs in more than 1 out of 10,000 patients , but less than 1 of 1,000 patients ) &quot; Radi@@ ation Rec@@ all &quot; ( skin rash similar to severe sun@@ burn ) , appearance on the skin that was previously exposed ( a few days to years ) of radiation therapy .
occasionally , in patients who received A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA , usually in combination with other cancer patients , stroke or stroke with low damage occurred .
in patients who receive radiation treatment before , during or after their A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA treatment , a radiation caused by radiation may occur ( scar@@ ring of the pul@@ mon@@ ary veins associated with radiation treatment ) .
52 Get your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or if you notice side effects that are not listed in this package .
if prepared , the chemical and physical stability of the dil@@ uted and the in@@ fusion solution for storage in the fridge or at 25 ° C was proved for a period of 24 hours .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat di@@ ets .
patients taking All@@ i and no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , which causes approximately one quarter of the fats led to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco , stool , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily fa@@ eces , gradu@@ ation o@@ ily sh@@ utter ( f@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or an cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the whole European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for reducing the weight of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ tical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , the dosage is not necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the substance or any of the other components • Premature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Cholest@@ asis • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat rich diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take medicines for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted if necessary .
patients taking all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take extra precau@@ tionary measures to prevent failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the interaction of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained at normal levels of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins .
however , it should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the dose of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decline in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal natural and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine because absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of reported adverse events identified after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown because these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to di@@ lem@@ ma with regard to possible and actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight individuals over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings occurring .
the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at can be trac@@ ed back .
the therapeutic effect begins in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in remnant of the ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic elev@@ ations .
from clinical studies , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day to block the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ tical , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change - 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could not be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of accumulation .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased secre@@ tion of fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment starts , as you may have not consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet at that time .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood of you exceeding your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a high @-@ fat main court or a durable fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ er , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children . • Do not use it after exp@@ ir@@ ation date given on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue cargo box ( shuttle ) attached to this pack .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ ak to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at most per day .
take note of the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
what amount is appropriate for you , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with recommended intake of fat is essential .
if you take the same amount of fat as previously , this can mean that your body can not process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ence to the recommended intake of fat , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week of weight without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not walk up stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities daily . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal daily by exercising , e.g. by 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional journal with information about the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program for weight loss support combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed on calorie and fat showers and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a customized weight loss program , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and reach your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate causes of nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti @-@ oxid@@ ant ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
this means that the drug inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to prevent the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 8@@ 42 adult patients who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers of nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 out of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 from 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the regular trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the large intestinal transit , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised , however , with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron containing drugs which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to other chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents , Alo@@ is is not intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five tested chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ cle@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( di@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , an@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience concerning the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) who were at least in connection with Alo@@ xi ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
di@@ aly@@ sis studies have not been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is unlikely to be effective in an al@@ op@@ ric over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life , 4 hours ) or 100 mg dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life , 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , given intraven@@ ously at day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials of indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out by 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. of administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
after IV administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular carcin@@ oma was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , the total tex@@ tural position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ off of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged active substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection in healthy patients , the overall body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased in patients with severe liver dysfunction , but a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered to be sufficient above the maximum human@@ istic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , clu@@ es found that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .
the holder of this authorization for the placing of the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the medicine approved within the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative report recommen@@ ding the use of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon must resem@@ ble a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ effective constitu@@ ent that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon must be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue as@@ signs damage ; moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ norm@@ ality are elevated .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data based on the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged What are the major concerns that the CH@@ MP has led to the recommendation ?
in addition , concerns have been vo@@ iced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug marketing cannot suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease wor@@ sen@@ ed more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; Al@@ ph@@ eon has also had more side effects .
apart from this , the study used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medi@@ cam@@ ent forms an immune response ( i.e. the body trains antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) are not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection that is associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties ( cra@@ cking or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ con does not work against this kind of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was subsi@@ ded after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients suffering from Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in the case of skin wound , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been established that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the point of order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections were out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small hospitals , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. an authorisation for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary open wounds the efficacy of retinal det@@ achment was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area .
the effect of the simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on poor@@ ly developed skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % after top@@ ical application of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ ul@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ob@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiotics .
when deciding whether to continue or stop breast@@ feeding or to continue the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections applied to Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the place of administration that concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a half synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ wort ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ac@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding point of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer center .
by binding at this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit the pep@@ tide transfer , block some of the P binding posts interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if based on the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms seem to be question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and rub@@ bed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake in people after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of reduced skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng / h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro screening on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mice &apos;s lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in the rats micro@@ core test for in @-@ vivo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats show signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure compared to the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dosing of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between one and fifteen years who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the im@@ muni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 Twin@@ rix adults and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same illnesses , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix included identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix grown @-@ ups were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix fought between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambition of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six month and a 12 months gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ency ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , the first dose at the date of the choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six and twelve months .
if a booster dose is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are the same as after vacc@@ ination using the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , need a booster shot as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ active Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the gift of further vaccine doses may be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal result in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ically , as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was introduced in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined mass m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study which was conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines in this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ r@@ ers and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 muni@@ tions doses Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation based on a calculation basis per dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects after the administration of Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects after the dose of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete in@@ oc@@ ulation cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose in@@ oc@@ ulation scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of in@@ oc@@ ulations which reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ active Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials carried out at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the anti @-@ HA@@ V serum rates were 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
anti @-@ HB@@ s serum conversion rates were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was inv@@ alu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine , significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose in@@ oc@@ ulation scheme with Ambi@@ rix , or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be demonstrated over at least 24 months after the muni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study versus both anti@@ gens was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it has been shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month in@@ oc@@ ulation scheme to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year was given at the same time with the booster shots of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for the current formulation as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on the appearance of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to article 114 of the 2001 / 83 / EC amended version , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing food and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in waters contaminated by water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both V@@ acc@@ ine doses ( even though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have had an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. if you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the normal dose of the second vaccine ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a de@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine against the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child is undergoing a ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has received or has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women are not administered , unless it is urgently necessary that they be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in case of your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the insertion site or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 in@@ oc@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Di@@ stress • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination using comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 in@@ oc@@ ulated doses ) are :
these include limited or extended ras@@ hes that can be it@@ ching or can be bul@@ ky , swelling of the eye area and face , ag@@ grav@@ ating breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop in blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP argued that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
am@@ mo@@ p can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia @-@ based en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ rap@@ es@@ - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) respectively a nose @-@ probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ wealth could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
am@@ on@@ ess can also cause loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , fla@@ vor@@ ing , or fla@@ vor@@ ing , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ wealth was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the condition at the time of approval , only limited information on this medicine was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use if hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the development of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) of sodium per 20 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as in case of with sodium retention and e@@ dem@@ a formation .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate are carried out via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , the neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation slow@@ ed and increased neur@@ ons decreased .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain , thereby preventing brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding times ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
one case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dently single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ating with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced for every gram of between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is diagnosed early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life to death .
it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ um ( but within the first month of life ) by ha@@ emat@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen secre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl ) , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with time with a lot of mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein reduced diet , was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atically with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after adding a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , as well as repeated donations of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form , plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycle disturbances or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) did not det@@ ectable phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no adverse effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic dos@@ ages ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ ia or nas@@ al secre@@ tion .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 mg ) of sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) of sodium per 20 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , l@@ esi@@ ons occurred in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine therefore is suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ tin @-@ glut@@ amine can be produced for every gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ulate form , plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
this procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine by means of a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products which accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding , as the medicine may move into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disturbances , det@@ achment of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ b@@ ance and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you encounter one of these symptoms , get in touch with your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood @-@ balance ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , taste disturbances , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , unpleasant skin odor , rash , ren@@ al dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the container and the container after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Can be found &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly on same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ stel ( tube that passes through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose @-@ probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Remove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon Gran@@ ules . • Cover a straight edge , e.g. a knife bridge over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Det@@ ach the recommended number of measuring spoon Gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thick@@ nesses ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress @-@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS when the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a certain dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients were often a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the use of GP@@ I - was equally effective in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment .
in patients with a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox@@ in was as effective in all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except in severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bic@@ vali@@ an@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people suffering from high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd with an approval for the transport of angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift @-@ inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or when an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is subsequently performed in the patient , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
an injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately prior to the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
for patients with moder@@ ately severe kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) which are subject to PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is checked again 5 minutes after the second one .
in patients with mild kidney damage included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT was 5 minutes after the addition of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also on di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the c@@ ess@@ ation of the IV administration of frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular lifting .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active ble@@ ed@@ ings or increased bleeding complications due to a distur@@ b@@ ance in hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ din is given in combination with a different anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if most hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages of arter@@ ial punc@@ tures occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous correlation of cor@@ on@@ ary interventions ( PCI ) may be bleeding all over the world .
in patients who are treated with war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine , supervision of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine reaches the level before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) , these active ingredients may increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ reconc@@ iled female with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly checked .
animal experimental studies are insufficient in regards to implications for pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , band@@ aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tured he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine Group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , there were more frequent adverse events in women as well as in patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages were significantly less frequent than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the punc@@ ture area , reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels ≥ 4 g / dl with well @-@ known point of bleeding , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood cell , re@@ operation of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ ali@@ zations that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there were more frequent adverse events in women as well as in patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages were significantly less common among bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ors than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine must be inter@@ cep@@ ted immediately and the patient will be closely mes@@ hed to monitor the signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and in the ani@@ onic binding region of thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part re@@ builds the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ ine .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine had no plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation reaction with serum for patients in which it had come to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is confirmed by the prolon@@ gation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if one PCI was performed following one PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ fra@@ cked He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were equally distributed across the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ took within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous correlation of cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ din as pep@@ tide has a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ utilization of the amino acids in the body @-@ pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the spl@@ itting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
the elimination takes place in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a first order process with a terminal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on conventional drug safety studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data cannot identify specific dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10 times of the clinical ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was restricted to excessive pharmac@@ ological effects .
adverse events due to long @-@ term physiological stress in response to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure to those in clinical use , even at a much higher dosage .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use solution 17 does not take place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C to be stored .
An@@ gi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single @-@ dose converter from type 1 glass to 10 ml sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium .
5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle of An@@ gi@@ ox and slightly wa@@ sted until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear .
5 ml are taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glu@@ cos@@ el solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or is given as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active duration than a short @-@ effective male insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in Type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot operate insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin resistance .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin pleas@@ los@@ s@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra to the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal cavity .
the reduced glucose ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism can reduce the need for insulin in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change in the amount of action , the brand ( manufacturers ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may result in a change in the amount of insulin .
3 An insufficient dose or interruption of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effective profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment regi@@ men .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia belong to oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzymes ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ cop@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic therapies such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ ving , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin secre@@ tion enters into human breast milk , but generally , insulin does not come into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it absorbed by oral application .
the following are listed from clinical trials , listed according to system organ classes and classified according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , drow@@ sin@@ ess , over@@ ly hun@@ - , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Will be missed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area , as a result , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a suit@@ ably trained person or by intraven@@ ous glucose therapy by a doctor .
after glu@@ ability , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin shots the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male participants aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin pro@@ li@@ s@@ ine in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , an under@@ proportional increase in glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin emul@@ si@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin pro@@ li@@ s@@ ine was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control than with normal normal insulin was achieved 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin inj@@ ections are applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control as with normal normal insulin is achieved ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin pro@@ li@@ s@@ ine at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal , compared to normal normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( picture 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin pro@@ li@@ s@@ ine at 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
