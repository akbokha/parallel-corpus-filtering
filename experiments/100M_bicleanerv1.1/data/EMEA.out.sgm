<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendation, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirr thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder where the patients have alternating periods of abnormal mood alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to inhale or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the transmission of signals between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to one another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly known as a "partial Agonist" for receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also known as serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazl acts as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less measure than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurring symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb (assimilates).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">For up to 74 weeks, Abilify retaliated more effectively than placebo to restore manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify-injections in 10 or 15-mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased restlessness more effectively than placebo and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common Abilify side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (unchecked bite), acathisie (constant motion), nausea, nausea, saliva hypersecretion (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with mainly manic episodes, outweighing the manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the launch of Abilify in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mostly had manic episodes and their manic episodes were referred to in the treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages exceeding a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the replacement of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal risk associated with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including celeriac and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate an MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polyphenol, polyuria, polyphagony and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to combination bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other central active drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of absorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC by Aripiprazl by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism can result in a combined application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl than CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteaseinase, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level before the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem (or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextrometorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (Dextrometorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data position for the safety of humans and the concerns arising in the reproduction studies of the animal, this drug may not be used during pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of more than 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and dyskinesia, occurred in patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazl and 13.1% for patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was seen in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with lanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23,5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients undergoing treatment of haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study, over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term study period more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potential clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters were observed, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Elevations of the CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole, include malignant neuroletic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentionally acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemmodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hematalysis is of benefit in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazl has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptors and for serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HTA receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease in binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and the putname.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a semi-operation dol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents' response was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scales, which were defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery-Aberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the response rate was found for Aripiprazl, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Oklapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazl also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic features that were not associated with lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl was thinking about the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal age is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl in extensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours with 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as did a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenia patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics revealed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function to the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional safety macology studies, toxicity in repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, pre-clinical data could not detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) in women with the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- arithpiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys are well below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after doses that led to positions of 3 and 11 times of the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazl injection solution and begin with the oral application of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimize the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by circumvention of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine regarding Abilify tablets, Abilify fusion tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution in patients with toxicity and behavioural disorders that were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed regarding extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including celeriac and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and indication of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmias).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polyphenol, polyuria, polyphagony and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar mania due to combination bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after allotted application of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazl (15mg dose) was used intramuscularly as a single-paitor and who were at the same time receiving Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of absorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism can result in a combined application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- proteaseinase, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level before the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after allotted application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazl injection solutions (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials involving Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% for patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study, over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">During the long-term study period more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazole was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potential clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters were observed, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Elevations of the CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole, include malignant neuroletic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioral disturbance was the Aripiprazl injection solution combined with statistically significant improvements of toxicity / behavioural disorders compared with placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as obesity and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole Injection Solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in relation to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement of the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe detachment, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a semi-operation dol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents' response was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the response rate was significantly higher for Aripiprazole (oral), which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Oklapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which were not associated with lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl was thinking about the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours Aripiprazl AUC is 90% bigger in the first 2 hours after injection of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazl injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was intramuscular to 15- and 5 times over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application no safety-related concern after maternal exposure was found, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, pre-clinical data could not detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">These effects were observed in rabbits following dosages leading to expositions of 3- and 11-fold of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dosage.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which three quarters previously had received anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in the sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In the main study, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane were compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatment of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">In addition, it may not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before or before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel than conventional paclitaxel, and that unlike other paclitaxel drugs, it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the Abraxis BioScience Limited Company for the transport of Abraxane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line metastatic disease failed and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent runs.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy degree 3, treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles, the dosage must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There have been no studies conducted with patients with impaired renal function and there are currently no sufficient data to suggest dosage adjustment in patients with impairment of the renal function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nano-articulation of paclitaxel, which could have significantly different pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">Patients should not be discharged again, until the neutrophils are increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardio toxicity was not proven in connection with Abraxane, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In the event of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients following the treatment of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual anticotics and constipation.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or for women in childbearing age that do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraction method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to make no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised to have sperm conserved before treatment, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect transport efficiency and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal clinical phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1, adverse events are reported which have occurred in combination with Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactine hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thorax wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, hernia pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, back pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection with a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules that promotes the concentration of microtubules from the tubulas and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumeireceptor and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (cream protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two randomised unbanned studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapy of paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastatic breast cells.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic breast cancer and 19% for metastatic breast cancer and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and progression-free survival for patients receiving first-line treatment are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to terminate at baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to drugs (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After an intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg. / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane dose (43%) than a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher with Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine secretion was 4% of the given total dose, with less than 1% of the Metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients aged over 75 years of age, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances, caution should be taken when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, it is slowly injected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion fluid into a sterilised water bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete addition of the solution, the deflector should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the picker should be swivelled slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete reset of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If any precipitations or smeles are visible, the puncture bottle must be inverted once more in order to achieve a complete reset prior to the application.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training instruction • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packaging. • With clear visual representation of the correct application of the product provided cold boxes for the transport by patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal drugs").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications may arise in connection with a blood transfusion if a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is not possible prior to the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders indicated by the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a blood donation, Abseamed is to be injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always lie in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, an anaemia may be caused by erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">When administered as an injection into a vein as part of a major study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems, abseamed was compared to the reference medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="370">All participating patients had been injected Eprex / Erypo in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either renamed to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between the weeks 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abseamed injected under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients treated to abseamed were maintained to the same extent as in those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients still receiving Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that, according to the European Union regulations, it has been proved that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG for the transport of abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general state (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, with planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volume (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic procedure in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml should not be applied to an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except in pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anesmiesymptomas and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex, and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose that is required for controlling anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous administration if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age, sex, and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose needed to control the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value has increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticuinal number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the increase in haemoglobin &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the incidence of reticucytes &lt; 40,000 cells / µl are increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticular zyme is increased by ≥ 000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the incidence of reticucytes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value is an allusion to epoetin alfa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required, should be maintained twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donor programme, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the seamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">On this occasion, epoetin alfa should be preoperatively given 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the intervention as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from erythropoetin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) under the treatment with any erythropoetin should not receive a seamed or another erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastomia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients with greater elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous donor program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pros, accompanying or underlying disease: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial hypertension, vascular disease of the otiotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently received heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the presence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effect, defined as a reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the residual value should be determined and the usual causes for a failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminumxiation, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the residual value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes "index"), is reduced (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microlitre or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the haemoglobin target concentration recommended in section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed if erythropoogenous active substances (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the application of epoetins when the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the anemia symptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded with maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumor patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account in the evaluation of the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transmissible).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment for patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient, who should also consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients with greater elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia should be investigated and treated accordingly before the start of epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing greater elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thromboseprophylaxis because they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl there is an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when haemoglobin target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">On thrombotic, vascular events like myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular attacks, deep venous thromboses, arterial thromboses, pulmonary thrombosis, reins thromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascularic events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Independent of erythropoietin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="532">You suffer from serious circulatory disorders of the heart (coronary heart disease), the arteries of the legs or arms (peripheral arterial hypertension), the cervical vessels (vascular disease of the otides) or the brain (cerebrovascular disease) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="533">During treatment with abseamed, there can be a slight dose-dependent increase in the number of blood platelets within the normal range, which will recover after further treatment.</seg>
<seg id="534">Your doctor may, if necessary, perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of platelets during the first 8 weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="535">Lack of iron, dissolution of red blood cells (haemolysis), blood loss, vitamin B12- or folic acid deficiency, should be taken into account and treated with abseamed before the start of therapy.</seg>

<seg id="543">A 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the efficacy of abseamed.</seg>
<seg id="544">200 Your doctor will regularly determine your levels of red blood dye (hemoglobin) and adjust your abseamed dose accordingly in order to keep the risk of blood clumping (thrombotic event) as low as possible.</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk for thrombotic vascular events, e.g. if you are obese (e.g. a deep vein thrombosis or lung embolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">If you are cancer patients, remember that abseamed can act like a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances may have a negative impact on the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="547">If larger orthodontic surgery is available to you, pre-treatment with abseamed should be the cause of your anaemia and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of the red blood dye (hemoglobin) are too high, you should not receive Seamed because there is an increased risk of blood cloning after surgery.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your anemia refers to treatment, the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well tuned, you will receive regular doses of abseamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice weekly, distributed on two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor may, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>

<seg id="561">Eyelids and lips (Quincke-edema) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms such as tingling, redness, itching, heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="562">Erythroblastopenia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see section "Specific caution when using abseamed is required").</seg>
<seg id="563">After repeated blood donations it can come - regardless of the treatment with abseamed - to a blood-drop formation (thrombotic vascular events).</seg>
<seg id="564">Treatment with abseamed can be associated with an increased risk of blood prop after surgery (post-operative thrombotic vascular events) when your initial hemoglobin is too high</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (bone fractures), including those who have recently suffered a low-traumatic hip fracture like the hoof; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) before the first infusion or by injecting into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after infusion such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Paget's disease, Actona may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Actona is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for Zometa was used to evaluate aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">The first study involved almost 8,000 older women with osteoporosis, and the number of spine and hip fractures was studied for a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently had suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was studied for a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, in two studies, aclasta was tested in 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood returned normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of eddy fractures was reduced by 70% over a period of three years in patients suffering from aclasta (without any other osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients suffering from aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Actona had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients with placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Actona occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent with repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronylic acid or other bisphosphonates or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney complaints, reactions at the infusion point and osteoneclipse (dying of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Actona provides information for doctors who prescribe the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains instructions on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted the Novartis Europharm Limited Company a permit for the placing of aclasta across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk for fractures, including patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Contradication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy eating • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk for fractures, including patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg of aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of acetone infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For treating the disease Paget, aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease pathogen Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the disease pathogen Paget with aclasta a long remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget to ensure adequate intake of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Acupa infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring in the first three days after the administration of acetone may be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen just after the application of acetone.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see Section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min), as this patient population has limited clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with aclasta prior to treatment with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Zoledronylic acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget to ensure adequate intake of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be examined before using bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients needing dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring in the first three days after the administration of acetone may be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen just after the application of acetone (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of suspected cases of atrial fibrillation was increased in patients receiving aclasta (1,3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronylic acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which manifested itself as a decrease in the kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin clearance (measured annually prior to administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited renal function were comparable in a clinical study in osteoporosis over three years between the Aclastate and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values that were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l) were up to 2.3% of patients treated with aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the Morbus Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">In addition, all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to prevent clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of aceta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of Zoledronylic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions at the infusion point, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been studied, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which have been treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteonnecrosis in the jaw area with an aclasta and a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdose leading to clinically relevant hypokalemia, calcium gluconate can be compensated by adding oral calcium and / or intravenous calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis (Styria) once a year for 3 consecutive years was observed in post-menopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density T-T (BMD) T-Score for the cockle dog ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric body fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or several new vertebrates fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta treated patients of 75 years and older had reduced risk of vertebral fractures by 60% compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a lasting effect over three years, resulting in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) aclasta significantly increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the whole hip by 6.0%, of the cervical area by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic region.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular meshing volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone structure compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5-mg dose of Acupa reduced significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The overall mortgage was 10% (101 patients) in the treated group, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the treatment of aclasta compared to placebo treatment increased the BMD at the overall penal and the shear neck at all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">In comparison to placebo treatment, the aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total fractures and 4.3% in the cervical area compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to reduce clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), an annual dose of aclasta compared to once weekly of alendronate was not subject to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with the disease pathogen Paget of the bone is studied in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, above all mild to moderate severe Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid compared to taking 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In combination with combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influencing was observed after 6 months compared to baseline for aclasta and risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responders at the end of the six-month study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 patients treated with aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 of patients treated with aclasta compared to 71 patients treated with risedronate during an average follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronylic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting, very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long elimbation period with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of separation (α and β, with the above-mentioned t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total-body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of the metabolized substances by Cytochrom P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because cioledronylic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no more direct and / or irreversible, material-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledronylic acid correlated with the creatinin-clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-clearing, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 studied patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction down to a creatinin clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">There are no statements available for severe kidney dysfunction (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The maximum non letally acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in mice.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of coledronylic acid was determined in rats by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, equivalent), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated excpositions, which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorphic effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in dosages starting from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a substance class called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget's disease, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is constructed in an unordered manner, which weakens the bone material than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone structure, ensuring normal bone formation and thus retaining strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery, inform your doctor that you are treated with aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using aclasta with other medicines please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you have used / used other medicines or used it recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using aclasta together with foods and drinks, you may be concerned that you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with aceta according to your doctor's instructions.</seg>
<seg id="679">Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year, which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion in a vein.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">As aclasta is working for a long time, you may need another dose only after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood does not become too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, aclasta can work for longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Acpaya is missed, please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before finishing the treatment with Actona Falls, please consider your next doctor's appointment and discuss it with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion very often occur (with more than 30% of patients), but are less frequent after subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days of the administration of aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">At the moment, it is unclear whether Actona causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated. • It can be used together with a different diabetesmedication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyanide or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl hard or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl hard or insulin can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, which makes it better to adjust type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients, the efficacy of Actos was assessed in tripletherapy; in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin containing a sulfonyl harnand, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos lead to lowering the HbA1c factor, suggesting that blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional dose of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and sulfonyl harnin decreased by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos additionally reported a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that in the course of a monotherapy (for the sole use), Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Bareda Europe R & D Centre Limited permission to transport Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where metformin is inadequate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treating with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output hepatic values (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzymes must be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymes must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should continue, should be directed to the clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters have been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">A slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred under therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparison of controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and a lesser extent in patients with sulfonyresins and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two-cell or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonyanide or as a dual combination therapy with insulin can reduce the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction in visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thiazole indions including pioglitazone, an occurrence or a worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but concordant doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative drug therapy.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and should a patient wish to be pregnant or enter, the treatment is deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Drug interactions which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction of the mother's insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance resulting from pregnancy and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (cannot be estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary alteration of the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents often performed the three times the upper limit of the standard range as often as in placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl harnants.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than in placebo, when Pioglitazone was respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred in patients treated with Pioglitazone in 44 / 870 (5.1%) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative drug therapy.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to function via a activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferation activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients with blood sugar were randomly assigned to Pioglitazone or placebo in spite of three months of optimization with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients compared to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as negligibly but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant rise in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, while values were observed under metformin and Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the Nüchtern Triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 52 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups that received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">Following oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness in approximately threefold the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the decay (55%) and a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unaltered Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agree on repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduction in hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the placental under treatment with Pioglitazone and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazole indions resulted in increased frequency of colorectal tumours.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or gliclacide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients compared to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the Nüchtern Triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the goal of its primary endpoint, which provided a combination of the overall mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary reascularization and revitcularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was studied in 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to effectively use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that blood sugar levels were lowered similarly strongly as with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">Also, the doses of actraphane have to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package supplement).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane outweigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the Novo Nordisk A / S approval to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the placing of Actraphane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily if rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">For example, patients whose blood glucose level has improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy can change the hypoglycemia risk symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (recombinant DNA compared to insulin-animal origin) may result in a change in dosage.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of toxic cases (i.e. more than 3% of patients needed no treatment against a gasification) in the months 16 to 24.</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the toxicity, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the toxicity up to 24 months.</seg>

<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses are proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For cans between 120 mg and 300 mg, a rise in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax is approximately 2,8 to 3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) as well as in the fracture intervention trial (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In the phase III trials, the middle ascents of the BMD with alendronat 10 mg / day compared to placebo reached 8.8% in the vertebral column, 5.9% in the femur and 7.8% at the Trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronate, a 48% reduction (alendronat 3.2% compared to placebo 6.2%) was achieved in patients who suffered one or several eddy fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the BMD climbs of the vertebral column and the Trochanter still continued; the BMD of the femur and the whole body was also maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled studies where Alendronat was taken daily (5 mg. a day for 2 years and then 10 mg. a day either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of alendronate reduced the incidence of at least one new eddy fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% compared to placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Absorption At an intravenous dose of reference, the median oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before the intake of a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability declined accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronat was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) led to no clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in average in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distributions of rats revealed that Alendronat is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after IV administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly circulated in the bones or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After an intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate, about 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the decay.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Following IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronat was 71 ml / min and systemic clearance exceeded 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronat is not excreted through the kidneys via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect the excretion of other medicines by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and transplantation of transplant patients should prescribe this medication or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and the appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advantine should primarily be based on clinical assessment of puncture and tolerability in individual cases and on blood sample regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">Following the conversion from Prograf to Advantf, the tacrolimus talc should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, systemic exposure, measured as tallow, was comparable with both veneer and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of tacrolimus talc levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant taking into paragraph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advantf must be converted to a once daily intake of Prograf capsules at once daily intake of Prograf capsules, so this conversion has to take place in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After switching from other immunosuppressive drugs to Advantf once a day, the treatment with the oral initialdose, recommended in both kidney and liver transplant, must begin with the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood-tal mirrors in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose may be required.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level, a calculation of the creatine reception and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advantf When switching from a Ciclosporter to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of full-blood tacrolimus-tallow-mirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common checks of tacrolimus talc during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic examinations during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of tacrolimus should also be checked after switching from prograf to advance, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tacrolimus-blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advancement is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood level of tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects which may occur in consequence of tacrolimus or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and the appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded formulation is available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which may lead to a reduction of tacrolimus in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies should be avoided during a treatment with advance (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, especially careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases an aqueous or septum hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy could be observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malignant skin alterations due to suitable clothes or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain constant concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, ittraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels results primarily from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 may affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, decisions on contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially lessen the clearances of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of patients with transplant patients do not indicate that under tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases, known as other highly effective immunosuppressants, are often increased in patients treated with tacrolimus which often increases susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of the BK-Virus-associated Nephropathy and JC-Virus-associated progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasties including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours associated with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysible.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level should mediate the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12) responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumrelated inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain range of lymphocycine genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 lungmutated patients, with 475 patients undergoing a pancreatic transplant and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant, were used as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis on a recent, multi-centric study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin during a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus patients in 21.7% of the cases for the development of a bronchiolitis obliterans were compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus patients (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the development of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndroms was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pankreastransplantation A multi-centric study of oral prograf was conducted to 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancreatic and renal transplantation following a randomised procedure of tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (by protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colorectal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric trial with oral prograf as a primary immunosuppressant after colon transplants showed a current survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, additional dose of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, which lead to Talsi between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmad et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations which lead to an increase in the unlinked faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion takes place mainly via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advantf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform common checks of tacrolimus talc during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic examinations during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has been treated as therapy-resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are currently no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advantf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood coagulation disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of use depends on whether Advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but manufactured using a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell containing a gene (DNA) that enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is another medicine approved in the European Union named Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, Advate's efficacy in the prevention of hemorrhages was evaluated in 86% of 510 new blood counts with "excellent" and "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for the placing of Advate in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following hemorrhaging events, the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period does not fall under the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of the VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII, different in vivo regaining and different half-time periods.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for the long-term prophylaxis of haemorrhages in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitory values, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be adjusted according to the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) versus Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always tested against the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII IgG Immunglobuline, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml Plasma with modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestic known inhibitory development, recombinant VIII-product recombinant inhibitors were observed after switching from one recombinant Factor VIII product to another.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there is no experience concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs used in the largest number of patients were inhibitors to Factor VIII (5 patients), all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rare (1 / 10,000), very rare (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- mirrors in plasma as well as the clearance rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) had detected a FVIII inhibitor after previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial, 5 of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated inhibitors against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell proteins, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, prenatal, skin rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions as part of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products ADVATE reports about hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoider reactions (frequency not known).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP still rated the benefit risk assessment as positive but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should request another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), officially announced that the company receives its application for approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Krebs.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically altered to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "Adenovirus" "" "which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumours and thus enable cancer cells to rebuild the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene, which is not defective in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and split.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient with Li-Fraumeni-Krebs in the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin's injection into Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notify the CHMP if the withdrawal consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified active release" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all hay fever symptoms, except constipation of the nose, patients receiving aerosaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients with aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aeronaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia (sleepiness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients that are resistant to adrenergic active substances or lauatadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), urinary or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (cerebral haemorrhage caused by cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit to transport aeroplanes across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerofaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as with long-term usage the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease over time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerofaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolide, Lisurid, Cabergoline, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be attributed peroral or nasal as a diminishing Rhino drug (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient group and the data does not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction, and the data did not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treatment should be reduced by hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be deposed for at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor testing showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether or not it was alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aeronaze during pregnancy is not assured, however, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies revealed no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictor properties of Pseudoephedrine, aeropaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that very rare cases may result in a dizziness which may result in impairment of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuce.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, aspiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil dire and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 out of human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the expression of the adhesion-cell P-Selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, the lost 5 mg. did not affect standard measurement values of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can produce other sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged 12 to 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerosaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine for the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerosaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aninaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the plasma was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the body weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four volunteers underwent malnutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole application of pseudoephedrine is bioequivalent to exposure to an aeronaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, based on conventional safety macology studies, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, pre-clinical data with desloratadin can not detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The pharmaceutical vigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and lactating or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of desloratadin very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleeping disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspicuous liver disease has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate (soluble tablet), 2.5 Mg- and 5 mg melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dosage is 1.25 mg once a day, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup and respectively.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies to patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by calculating the change in the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrils, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to inhale and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the number of symptoms (symptom number) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urticaria, the decrease in the number of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the SP Europe Enterprise a permit for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms end and at their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and Alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in dizziness, which may result in impairment of transport efficiency or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg, compared to patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times a clinical dose) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 out of human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion-cell P-selectine on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multiple doses given in desloratadin at a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was given a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times of the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement values of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes and itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis, depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histaminfection is a causative factor in all urticular diseases, it is expected that in addition to the chronic idiopathic urticaria, it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with disloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale for assessing these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient demos were comparable to the general seasonal hypoallergenic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Erius can be taken irrespective of meals, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see Section4.4) and that there is no data that support a treatment of a infectious aeritis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin investigations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age are fully metabolized (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolise normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains saccharose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or a sucrose isomaltase- insufficiency of this medicine should not take.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol, the performance of alcohol was not increased (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study in adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times a clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years of age used for anti-histamine therapy received a daily dichlorate dose of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (between 6 and 11 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study in adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times of the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not cause impairment of psychomotor functions.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous consumption of alcohol resulted in neither the increase in alcohol-induced deterioration of the performance nor an increase in sleepiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the overall results of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this fully metabolized phenotype was comparable in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The burden (AUC) through desloratadin was approximately 6times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant drug therapies after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single-dose studies, the AUC- and CMax values of desloratadin in paediatric patients were comparable with those of adults who received the desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1801">In a 17 single-dose study with adults, the lost 5 mg. did not affect standard measurement parameters of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1802">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1803">As shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1804">18 In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient demos were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1815">In a single dose study with adults, the lost 5 mg. did not affect standard measurement values of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The spread of this badly metabolized phenotype was comparable to adult (6%) and paediatric patients between 2 and 11 years (6%), and in black (adults 18%, children 16%) greater than with chewing gum (adults 2%, children 3%), however, the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population.</seg>
<seg id="1817">In single-dose crossover studies of Aerius Melting tablet with Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate, the formulations were bioequivalent.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Aerius 2.5 mg tablets have not been studied in paediatric patients, but in combination with the dosage studies in children, the pharmacokinetic data for Aerius Melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company has withdrawn its application for approval of Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the stem (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that is supposed to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from man to person because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane envelope of the virus was separated with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as a foreign body), purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenera is available as a solution for inhalation, but it cannot be taken together with kritonavir, as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">A generase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood was that the virus is addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of kritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years, and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Asparase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Asterase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood while taking in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>

<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, fortified with low dosed kritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-verifiable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load change after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not taken a protease inhibitor after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than in placebo, but was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, the viral load was also reduced in children, but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>

<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ampaviavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Generic ase may also not be used in patients who take up the St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines which are degraded just as agorase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines against HIV, patients who take Agenera are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonnecrosis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, the benefits of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years were outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of aorase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>

<seg id="1927">Usually, amenase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amponavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amponavir should be performed taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amponavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than of amponavir than capsule; therefore, agrogenase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not replaceable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for agorase capsules is 600 mg of amponavir twice daily along with 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If agorase capsules are applied without the intensifying additive of kritonavir (boosters), higher doses of agorase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>

<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoid that is metabolized by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of amenase with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopia including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>

<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrose have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or longterm use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 mediums with low therapeutic width aorase may not be given at the same time as medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the P450-Isoasyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width aorase with kritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose active substances are mainly transferred via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects for increased plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of ampavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>

<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary when nelfinavir is given together with amponavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax by contrast, reduced by 30% if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Ampeavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amponavir were used twice daily and kritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amponavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amponavir in plasma, which were achieved in combination of amponavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amponavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of ampavir and caletra cannot be given, but close-meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosine in combination with Didanosine, but due to the inviolable component of Didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, when using Efavirenz in combination with amponavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with ampavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapin may lower the serum concentration of ampaviavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of ampavir and kritonavir on delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of rifabutin caused an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with an asterase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asterase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamrenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamrenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors, or inductors of CYP3A4 can potentially lead to interactions when used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with an agorase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids cannot be taken at the same time as agorase as it may result in absorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amponavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of ampavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, Nicardipin, Nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent consumption with asterase can significantly increase plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors associated side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study in which Ritonavir 100mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dispensing of agorase with kritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced elevations of the plasma levels are to be expected while administering Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this drug is not recommended with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin, and tacrolimus can be increased while adding amponavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with an oral mdazolam (see section 4.3), while at the same time it is advisable to use parenteral midazolam with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicates a possible rise in the plasma level of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amponavir, the patients should therefore be monitored by opium removal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as to how to adjust the dose of the amponavir when administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended with simultaneous administration of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictably, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful observation of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time adding a generase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactating rats, ampaviavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether or not amponavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given by the embodiment in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period amponavir, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the offspring including fertility and reproduction capability was not impaired by the administration of amponavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The safety of Agenera was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical studies in combination with different antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the asterase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely lead to breakage.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are related to taking Agenera or any other medicines used at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenera twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4) which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>

<seg id="2009">Among 113 anti-retroviral people treated with ampavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, there were 7 cases (3%) in 245 NRTI- treated patients (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes of skin were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makuloquilous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrose have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunity, antiretroviral therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenera twice daily along with low dosed Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were very common to those who received Agenerase together with low dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary supportive measures are to be initiated.</seg>

<seg id="2018">The 50% hemorohm concentration (IC50) of amponavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of ampaviavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamrenavir / Ritonavir doses - as with other kritonavir therapy schemes with proteaseinase inhibitors - the mutations described rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamrenavir with 100mg of kritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, with which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance samples similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, M36I, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamrenavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic assessment systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amponavir associated genetic pattern generates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data about cross resistance between ampaviavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fossiamprenavir resistance trails, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral therapies in which a fossils-avir-containing pattern failed (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against Tipranavir), indinavir / kritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir / kritonavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amdetavir maintains its activity against some other protease-resistant isolates; the conservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which pre-treated adult after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly used with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis noted the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sufficiency threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbundled asterase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, an asterase solution for intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg was three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the anticipated benefits of" "" "unborn" "" "agorase should be taken into account in the treatment of therapy with PI previously treated." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the middle duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of ampaviavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax by contrast, reduced by 30% if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given together with amponavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amponavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amponavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by dietary intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of the blood stream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amponavir, which represents the active part, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>

<seg id="2200">Patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs do not have clinical experience, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actin keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip area.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinent keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions normally decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod Cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions are causing great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study revealed that patients with more than 8 ac- lesions showed less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immunostimulating properties, imiquimod should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not produce any direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the binding or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither the quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were quantified after a one-time topical application, no recommendation can be given to the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common adverse events in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the treatment of the Feignizen (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod) with the application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the imiquimod-cream in connection with side effects include discomfort on the site of application with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The patients treated by 185 with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse events, probably or possibly, with the application of the imiquimod-cream, were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of Phase III with Imiquimod-cream treated patients with actin keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the testing plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod, it is common to local skin reactions including Erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excuroriation / leaves / dished (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan, the clinical signs showed that in these studies five times weekly treatment with imiquimod-cream applied very often to serious erytopics (31%), severe erosions (13%), and heavy sweating and shortages (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was diagnosed at the centre of treatment or the surrounding area with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214).</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral absorption of 200 mg of Imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Clinically serious side effects, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, existed in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation systemic concentrations of alpha-interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy was clearly superior to a complete eradication of the hands during an imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of patients treated with Imiquimodine treated patients fully; this was in 20% of the patients treated with placebo (95% CI) in 20% of the patients treated with placebo:</seg>
<seg id="2224">Full healing was achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod with five-time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically healed and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic action lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the uneasiness of the scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The permitted indications External Feignizen, actin keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be demonstrated in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actin keratose was observed in the three-week weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0,1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that after topical application, Imiquimod's resorption was low in patients aged 6-12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actin keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the current toxicity of the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application revealed no similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with the oral administration on three days a week did not induce tumours in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for humans to look at because of systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice that were treated with the non-active cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme treatment in patients with a safe diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints that make movements more difficult, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a physician who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Administration of Aldurazyma should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but it was also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme reduced GAG concentrations in urine by around 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be highly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known each year and, where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the transport of Aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme action therapy in patients with a safe diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyma should be performed by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with durazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effects that arise during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where rehabilitation facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, expect nearly all patients to form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, it must be cautiously preceded by the theoretically elevated risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Pretreatment 60 minutes before the start of infusion with drugs (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of an easy or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate during which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single serious infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate during which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyma should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk is present, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 trial (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their lengthening of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are found in the following table following the following abundances: very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions were also observed, including bronchospasm, breathing malfunction and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated with a serokonversion within 3 months after the start of the treatment, whereby the patients at the age of 5 were treated with a more severe form of a serokonversion (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 trial (or up to an early departure from the study), there were no antibodies which were detectable by Radioimmunity (RIP) in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients, in which there was never a Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels found a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in urine while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody titers.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not impair clinical efficacy and / or decrease of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme action therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulatory system and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via manose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study covering the entire spectrum of diseases, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the expected FeV and the absolute minimum distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme each week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyms showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to perform in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG-Spiegel was established in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account both clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage of normal FeV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of movement of the Shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe congestion form and 4 with middle course).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was observed following the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with a severe form of decay (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe congestion only limited or no advances in cognitive development were to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens were performed on the GAG-Spiegel in urine, liver volume and 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another medicine for cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (cancer versus cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body. • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, the patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given together with cisplatin, a "anti-drug" (medicines for vomiting) and fluids should be given before or after the addition of cisplatin (to prevent fluid deficiency) before or after the addition of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood-image changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, removed or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetry thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetric in its active form is easier in cancerous cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleural orothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another anti-cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.2 months compared to Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, median survival with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells showed longer survival compared to the comparison medicine when administering Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each flow bottle has to be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml. (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with either advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is given as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the emetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is given as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">For reduction of the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the emetric administration and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">At least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days before the first dose of water mixed and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first real-time fixed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving psychiatric readings, a complete blood sample should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course, a dose check has to take place under consideration of the Nadir of the blood balance or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria are consistent with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ level 3 (except for neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA has to be canceled if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity occurs 3 or 4 in patients after 2 dose reductites or so- in the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients with 65 years of age or over 65 years of age when compared to patients aged under 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials in patients with a creatinin-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min there were no dose adjustments that go beyond the dosage adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin-clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5-fold of the upper bilirubin limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; 0.2 times the upper limit (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with respect to bone marital osuppression, and Pemetremixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils again reach a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cytic value has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, platelet number and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in level 3 / 4 hematological and nioatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was rejected if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetry must be relieved to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) need to avoid simultaneous use of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with water-mixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for whom a telemetric treatment is provided must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with water-mixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, drainage of the effusion is to be considered before telemetric treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with psychiatric signals if this drug was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since there is the possibility of irreversible effects of the reproductive capacity of telemetry, men should be advised in front of the treatment centre to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced emetry separation with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to use high doses of NSAIDs or ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">(ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with telemetry (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential of NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetremixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the clotting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for use of telemetry in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetry should not be used during pregnancy except if absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since there is a possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity of telemetry, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm containment.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared with 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains at the anus, flatus (winch) with stucco, stool, greasy / oily faeces, graduation oily shutter (feces), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with drugs such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (with which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or an cholesterol (liver disease), and in pregnant or nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Glaxo Group Limited for placing Orlistat GSK in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for reducing the weight of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypothetical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimally absorbed, the dosage is not necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Oversensitivity to the substance or any of the other components • Premature treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.5) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome • Cholestasis • pregnancy (see Section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take medicines for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic needs to be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients taking alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take extra precautionary measures to prevent failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on the interaction of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained at normal levels of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotins.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, it should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the dose of a single dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decline in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal natural and are related to the pharmacological effect of the medicine because absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported adverse events identified after the launch of orlistat is unknown because these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to dilemma with regard to possible and actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight individuals over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings occurring.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdosing have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by orlistat can be traced back.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect begins in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin remnant of the gastric and pancreatic elevations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies, 60 mg of orlistat was taken three times a day to block the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypothetical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin amounted to 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change - 4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could not be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who administered the minimal systemic resorbial dose, two main metabolites, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-shaped leucine group), could be identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, which are moderate causes of nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an anti-oxidant).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as the effects in this age group do not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the drug inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to prevent the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was studied in 1 842 adult patients who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers of nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 out of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the regular trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 from 189), 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the transport of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy, due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy because of a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for preventing nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the large intestinal transit, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised, however, with simultaneous dispensing of palonosetron containing drugs which extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to other chemotherapeutic agents, Alois is not intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five tested chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycleabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a steady state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (diexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (amodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ananitidine, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience concerning the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients) who were at least in connection with Aloxi (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Dialysis studies have not been carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is unlikely to be effective in an alopric overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies a total of 1,132 patients who received moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of dolasetron (half-life, 4 hours) or 100 mg dolasetron (half-life, 7.3 hours) were given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, given intravenously at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials of indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v. of administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV administration of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration measured in 11 testicular carcinoma was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron, the total textural position (AUC0- ∞) reached after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg measured value; however, the Cmax was higher after the one-off of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which compared to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged active substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single-time intravenous injection in healthy patients, the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Admittedly, the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron are increased in patients with severe liver dysfunction, but a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures that are considered to be sufficient above the maximum humanistic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies, clues found that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined in humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) passed a negative report recommending the use of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon must resemble a biological medicine named Roferon-A with the same drug-effective constituent that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon must be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue assigns damage; moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormality are elevated.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was brought into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufactures data based on the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non-commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged What are the major concerns that the CHMP has led to the recommendation?</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been voiced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug marketing cannot suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease worsened more patients than with the reference medicinal product; Alpheon has also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the study used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicament forms an immune response (i.e. the body trains antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) are not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection that is associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmities (cracking or cuts), abrasions and stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections caused by methiciline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarcon does not work against this kind of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the area to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was subsided after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients suffering from Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in the case of skin wound, approximately 90% of patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been established that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altartargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the point of order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo during short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small hospitals, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. an authorisation for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is stopped, the ointment is carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary open wounds the efficacy of retinal detachment was insufficient in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3-day treatment there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations which were achieved in humans after topical application on poorly developed skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole the middle Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% after topical application of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary when topical retapululin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinobamulin is preferable to the application of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether to continue or stop breastfeeding or to continue the therapy with Altargo is to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the altartargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections applied to Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the place of administration that concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of operation Retapamulin is a half synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passwort (formerly pleurotus passacerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding point of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptide transfer center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this binding point, Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptide transfer, block some of the P binding posts interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If based on the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Retapamulin at least some infection forms seem to be questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and rubbed skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake in people after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of reduced skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro screening on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mice's lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats microcore test for in-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats show signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure compared to the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application to 200 cm2 shielded skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral dosing of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmaco-vigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 module of the application, is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the marketing authorisation procedure is obligated to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaco vigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and described in the 1.8.2 module of the application for authorisation, as well as all additional updates of the RMP that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP should simultaneously be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment comes from being seen on one of these areas, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gazebo unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between one and fifteen years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 Twinrix adults and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same illnesses, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix included identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix grown-ups were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month period and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix fought between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of ambition of Ambirix was similar in a six month and a 12 months gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matency (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccines, the first dose at the date of the choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six and twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster dose is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are the same as after vaccination using the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons, who responded to hepatitis C vaccination, need a booster shot as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units of form-inactive Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and people with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels after priming, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccine doses may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal result in the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, however, Ambirix can be injected subcutanically, as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was introduced in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined mass mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study which was conducted with 3 vaccines in this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the earlier Thirers and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 munitions doses Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturation based on a calculation basis per dose of Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed in 50.7% of subjects after the administration of Ambirix compared to 39.1% in subjects after the dose of a dose of 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete inoculation cycle, 66,4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix reported pain, 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable to 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambirix compared to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose inoculation scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of inoculations which reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix, or during the 3-dose vaccination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalin-inactive Hepatitis B surface antigen, was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials carried out at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the anti-HAV serum rates were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Anti-HBs serum conversion rates were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In 289 people whose immunogenicity was invaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine, significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds one month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose inoculation scheme with Ambirix, or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be demonstrated over at least 24 months after the munization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study versus both antigens was comparable to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study in 12- to including 15-year-olds, it has been shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and Anti-HBs antibodies is comparable to 24 months after immunization in the 0-6-month inoculation scheme to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus-containing food and beverages, but can also be transmitted through other ways, such as swimming in waters contaminated by water.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both Vaccine doses (even though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix, or any component of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have had an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. if you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the normal dose of the second vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a decombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine against the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's own defense / or if you / your child is undergoing a haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently / has received / has received or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix pregnant or lactating women are not administered, unless it is urgently necessary that they be vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic) in case of your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very often (more than 1 case per 10 injected doses): • Pain or discomfort on the insertion site or redness • Matching • irritability • headache • loss of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ frequently (up to 1 case per 10 inocated doses): • swelling at the injection point • fever (above 38 ° C) • Distress • Gastro-intestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vaccination using comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 inoculated doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include limited or extended rashes that can be itching or can be bulky, swelling of the eye area and face, aggravating breathing or swallowing, sudden drop in blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data known since the issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP argued that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remained positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only placed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammop can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia-based encephalopathy (brain damage caused by high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonrapes- split into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) respectively a nose-probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonwealth could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Amoness can also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, flavoring, or flavoring, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonwealth was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval, only limited information on this medicine was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use if hyperammonic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">AMMONAPS is also available in granular form for infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarcanylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the development of esophagulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as in case of with sodium retention and edema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate are carried out via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), the neuronal proliferation slowed and increased neurons decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain, thereby preventing brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding times (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of overdose occurred in a 5-month old infant with an accidently single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phenylacetate, which in an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that is conjugated by acetylating with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate is produced for every gram of between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is diagnosed early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease itself resulted in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">It was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartum (but within the first month of life) by haematalysis, the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen secretion (sodium phenylbutyl), sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonic encephalopathy was 100%, but even in these patients it occurred with time with a lot of mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the orniethintranscarcanylase deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonic encephalopathy and treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein reduced diet, was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatically with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after adding a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis, as well as repeated donations of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral individual dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycle disturbances or haemoglobin, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) did not detectable phenylacetate in the plasma after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted via the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no adverse effects in toxic and non-toxic dosages (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules are either taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomia or nasal secretion.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarcanylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mg) of sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrate), lesions occurred in the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine therefore is suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that phenylacetyltin-glutamine can be produced for every gram of sodium phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form, plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine by means of a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products which accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">You may not take AMMONAPS during breastfeeding, as the medicine may move into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disturbances, detachment of hearing, disorientation, memory disturbance and a worsening of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you encounter one of these symptoms, get in touch with your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in instable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different thicknesses) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress-uplift" (an abnormal measurement value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is given and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS when the effect of angioxin was compared with a certain dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another anticoagulant drug) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients were often a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent closure), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as ciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the use of GPI - was equally effective in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients with a PCI, Angioxin was as effective in all indicators as Heparin, except in severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bicvaliandin, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people suffering from high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd with an approval for the transport of angiotoxin across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-lift-infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or when an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is subsequently performed in the patient, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately prior to the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous injection of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus gift from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolus of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered intravenously intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">For patients with moderately severe kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) which are subject to PCI (whether treated with Bivalidator against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is checked again 5 minutes after the second one.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with mild kidney damage included in the Phase III- PCI trial (REPLACE-2), the ACT was 5 minutes after the addition of the Bivalirudin Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also on dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the cessation of the IV administration of fractional heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular lifting.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hirudine • active bleedings or increased bleeding complications due to a disturbance in hemostasis and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalidin is given in combination with a different anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most hemorrhages of arterial punctures occur in PCI patients under Bivalidorine, patients who undergo a percutaneous correlation of coronary interventions (PCI) may be bleeding all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated with warfarin and treated with Bivalidorine, supervision of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bivalidorine reaches the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregations), these active ingredients may increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bireconciled female with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are insufficient in regards to implications for pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, bandaging or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalidator alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractured heparin or ennoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalidorine Group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, there were more frequent adverse events in women as well as in patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy haemorrhages were significantly less frequent than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy haemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or hemorrhage in the puncture area, reduction of haemoglobin levels ≥ 4 g / dl with well-known point of bleeding, reduction of hemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood cell, reoperation of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding localizations that occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bivalidorine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalidorine Group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, there were more frequent adverse events in women as well as in patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy haemorrhages were significantly less common among bivalidators than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Bivalidorine must be intercepted immediately and the patient will be closely meshed to monitor the signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalidator, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center and in the anionic binding region of thrombin, regardless of whether thromboin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalidator to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on its part rebuilds the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active center of thrombine.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalidorine had no platelet aggregation reaction with serum for patients in which it had come to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalidorine shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is confirmed by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If one PCI was performed following one PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of Biometrudin should be given and the infusion can be increased to 1,75mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfracked Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor before the start of angiography (at the time of randomization) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were equally distributed across the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients undertook within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and the 1- year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to the protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are shown in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or pre-PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy haemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito neal, intraocular bleeding or hematoma in the puncture area, reduction of hemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known point of bleeding, reduction of hemoglobin levels of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiotoxin in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous correlation of coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalidin as peptide has a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent reutilization of the amino acids in the body-pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination takes place in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional drug safety studies, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity or reproduction toxicity, pre-clinical data cannot identify specific dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10 times of the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was restricted to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Adverse events due to long-term physiological stress in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure to those in clinical use, even at a much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the ready-to-use solution 17 does not take place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single-dose converter from type 1 glass to 10 ml sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a piercing bottle of Angiox and slightly wasted until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken from the water bottle and diluted with 5% glucosel solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml Bivalidator.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or is given as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugars) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisine is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active duration than a short-effective male insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In Type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot operate insulin, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adult type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin pleaslossine or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of Apidra to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">The reduced glucose ogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism can reduce the need for insulin in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the amount of action, the brand (manufacturers), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may result in a change in the amount of insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dose or interruption of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the effective profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia belong to oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, discopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetic therapies such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserving, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin secretion enters into human breast milk, but generally, insulin does not come into the mother's milk, nor is it absorbed by oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following are listed from clinical trials, listed according to system organ classes and classified according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, overly hun-, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area, as a result, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a suitably trained person or by intravenous glucose therapy by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluability, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the subcutaneous GA- be of insulin shots the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with cou- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male participants aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin prolisine in the therapeutically relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportionate glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more, an underproportional increase in glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a similar postprandiale glycemic control is achieved in an application of insulin emulsisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin prolisine was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandiale control than with normal normal insulin was achieved 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin injections are applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control as with normal normal insulin is achieved (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin prolisine at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal, compared to normal normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (picture 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin prolisine at 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
