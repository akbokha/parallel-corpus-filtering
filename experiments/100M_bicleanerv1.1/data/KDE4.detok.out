To translate the website you will find the translation menu in & konqueror; -Menu under Extras Website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.
If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated into place of the entire & URL.
Automatic translation is very rudimentary. in the best case babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions depending on the translation, without checking the translation beforehand.
Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish website by yourself, where you can insert text directly.
The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier available.
For more information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions, refer to the Handbook & konqueror;.
To load these modules in & konqueror, choose setup extensions.... Open the toolbox Tools and select the modules you want.
This is a list of standard configuration modules from the box node; addons. please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.
You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.
To use the crash module, click the & konqueror; on Tools Off. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if available.
The View Filter module (also called Folder Filter) can be accessed in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Perspectives Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.
To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentelement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.
The Module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.
The peculiarity of & FSView; is to display nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree-maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportionally to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object.
With & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries. in this way, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily detected when they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.
In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap display a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem.
The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.
A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area of child rectangles should be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.
In case of representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.
How splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries takes place is left to the implementation. here it is for the caption and to avoid space losses through the frame always favourably dividing the areas in such a way that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive division.
You can set the minimum displayed space for an entry over the menu entry View Appendix to area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.
Originally & FSView was conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the KCachegrind application.
The Image Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Image Gallery... or Ctrl; I.
When you open the Image Gallery module, a dialog opens, allowing you to specify the appearance of the gallery.
The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.
The option Pictures per line has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of thumbnails in each line in the gallery.
The check box file name of the image indicates whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.
The check box file size of the image indicates whether the file size is displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.
With the image size check box, you determine whether the size of the images is displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.
In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders are to be included.
In the Save In HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.
With the check box subfolder, you can set up with a slider or a boggle up to which level the subfolders are included.
To copy the original images with the check box, specify whether the original images should be copied to the gallery.
Use the check box comment file to specify a comment file for caption of images in the gallery.
In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.
The Module & HTML; Settings provides easy access to general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.
The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in & konqueror; -Menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:
The Media Playback for the Navigation Pane can be found in the & konqueror; -Menu in the Navigation Pane window or by shortcut F9.
To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.
Change browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; add browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access to specific browsers only.
The default browser detection of & konqueror is compatible with Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses access to this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.
Changes the identity in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to call with & konqueror; Hotmail.
Pages that do not conform to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Use elements and attributes, are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.
With this option, the default browser identifier is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.
With the menu entry... you can set the extent of the information about the browser used and the operating system in detail.
With this & konqueror; -module, check your CSS, style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with W3C's recommendations and other standards.
Check the Website page in the & konqueror; check the menu on Extras Website. you can do the following exams:
With the & HTML; Verification test if your & HTML; -Document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponds to all found errors are displayed. with this check, you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.
Allows you to review your CSS; style sheets embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.

An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and upload your photos directly into & digiti. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g.2. of course each medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digiti. together.
& digitization; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.
Although & digitised; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it operates completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.
Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or the lens over which it can be searched.
Like all & kde; programs is also digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and ways of improvement.
& digitize; tries to make reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system.
& digikam; is a project supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digikam; if you are a regular user of & digikam, we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users soon. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.
You can also visit the digitizing; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam; to learn more.
The best start to participate & digitizing; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.
When you start & edit; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter a path name or click the folder icon folder to select a folder.
In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data collection is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.
Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digitize; will also use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digiKam set up collections
If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as the base folder. & digitised; view each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.
& digitio; Enduringly recursively expel the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it is in hidden folders. this allows you to insert exceptional & digitized; do this by inserting a point in front of the folder name.
If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist don't have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.
Once you have configured the base folder, you can set & digitize; set up your digital camera. after that you should learn how to use My Albums and keyword iste to manage your photos in the albums.
Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it can work & digitize; maybe even with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menus Help menu.
How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the section Roh Decodersettings and Roh workflow.
An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and upload your photos directly into & digiti. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g.2. of course each medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digiti. together.
Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transfer to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).
& digitization; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.
Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & digitised; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. you will find a complete list of supported cameras under this link.
Libg.2 has to be created with libexif support so that digicode thumbnails can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libg.2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.
One of the nicest things in & digitized; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:
KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.
Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function when changes in & digitised; even perform.
To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.
Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albenbauma, above the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords, data list or search.
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio
The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name only works when this ind symbol view is also displayed. what fields are displayed can be configured in the Albensettings dialog.
The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos that are managed by & digikam; are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they are stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date on which the album was first created.
If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan a photo directly to an album. you can also add a screenshot to an album.
To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can drag the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. just select all photos and move them to the destination album.
An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select Edit album Properties from the context menu.
Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a shared name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos if you choose to sort or delete albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.
The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.
The buttons older, average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last modification of each file is instead used in this folder.
When you first open an album in & digikam; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot;. this should help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.
To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As album preview. additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.
An album can always only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.
& digitiy; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My Key Word List at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.
The picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all the images in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo is shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.
When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait short while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all preview images.
Information about each image is displayed below the appropriate preview. what information this is, you can edit about Settings; set up. select the albums page here and customize the preview images to your liking.
The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse-cursor a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the Introduction section in the main window displays such a help window.
Photos are all about & digitized; go. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to it. you can reach all the features with & digitized; you can choose between viewing images, slide show or editing images.
You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Image Processing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing.... in the Edit section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with the image editing you can view your photos and change them.
It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not provided. you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub-menu of the file. you can find the applications listed there by the & node; file permissions for the file type.
You should note that after processing, other image editing programs may cause problems with the metadata containing in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.
& digitio; provides two ways to spin. the easiest way is to right click on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.
To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc.).
If you want to delete a photo & digitized; delete it, it will be moved to the garbage dump of & kde; F8 Image Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.
& quot; My data slisteer; organize your photos on the basis of the data. & digitiate; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.
If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the Picture View. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days are shown to you.
Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a cue has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or a search.
If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be shown.
Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keywordsearch & quot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.
The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported in the loss of the database as soon as & digikam; the pictures will be noticed.
You can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword & quot; or on an existing keyword and then select New Keyword. if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this will be the keyword of this keyword.
You can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.
You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to shift the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.
You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword Edit in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.
To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select Set as Albumpreview. additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.
To use the functionality with keywords, you first need to insert your photos with keyword. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword, drag and drop them. alternatively, you can also right-click on the thumbnails and select cue points from the context menu.
You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can give a cue for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.
Once you have completed a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.
You can remove a keyword in which you can right-click on the photo's context menu and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only displays the tags that have been assigned to the photo.
The time beam view displays a time-dependent adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a timeframe, just click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which displays the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.
In the field below you can type a title and save your selection. it will appear in the list below.
Includes all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.
If you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp will be red.
The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.
If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be performed. the results will be displayed in My Search list in the View My Search list. if you want to change your selection after the search, you just have to select the corresponding item from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.
When you select a search, the search form appears again with the search information entered before. if you select as an advanced search, the dialog for Advanced Search will appear to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for the search. further information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.
If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu Search.
Advanced Search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.
The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules are displayed line-wise, separated by operators or deleted. each option can be added to other via the logical operations All..., A..., No... or at least... you can create search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.
& digitised; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.
Similar items: this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar. using a swelleting the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.
Sketch: free-hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digitised; find the matching pics. also here a threshold value can be set.
This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Mini program. you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out or hold it hold and move it. move it while clicking the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this requires of course that your images contain geo data.
In the field below you can specify a name for your geo-filter. this will then be added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live location.
& digitiy; provides a lamp in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.
Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens. if you are back in & digitized, you can quickly open the light table with L Tools.
From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window pane is to be seen. if you want to sync preview from the toolbar and execute zoo or sliding operations on one of the pictures, then these are also executed with the other image. you can therefore compare the same range of both pictures.
Another mode is better suited for quick sorting out of a series of pictures. if you navigate combination mode, use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the left pane. the right adjacent image is displayed in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.
Of course the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file...
All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the luminaire. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.
At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pivot function you can see on the crossed paths. in order to pivot the visible area of the image, you have to click on them and hold the & LMB. in the Preview mode, both images will display the same image area.
The zoom works just like in other views. just use the zoom control under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out. this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode.
Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.
We give you a tool, a plan, and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use photos again. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digikam; use. we look at the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, evaluate, archive, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.
& quot; Digital inventory management picks up, indexes, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;
Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is defined in accordance with your definition data, which provide information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you do not need to find a specific photo for longer without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use & digikam;. the approach the metadata can be stored in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.
The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.
You might be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.
Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% are archives and 5% work files and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.
What types of files fit together? splitting file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.
The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.
We also recommend the option Metadata save in & digitised in the settings page of the metadata; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data can be written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu.
Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? add & edit; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.
Now the real work starts, as you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos during further work.
Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you are often called by other programs, or continue to categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.
When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded stitches, then & digikam; automatically set up the tree for you or insert the pictures to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by dragging a subtree to another.
The diagram shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth made up of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.
Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to lettering or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.
You don't want anyone to just let anyone see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in your photos.
Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it nearer, then catch some details, people, the place.
And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! one starts to dream, associations to have, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.
For others who consider your photos the title is possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.
It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.
With & digiGo, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as caption. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE even exports you a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, you will not have to tell the story a second time for the publishing.
Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now runs with speed of light.
The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will be deeply moving in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels using pictures with geographic indications. this then shows the photos at the reception location. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.
& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.
The following description tells you which information is digitized in the setup page of & digiti. should be stored as information:
Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.
Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples for this may be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.
Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the provider field to identify who operates the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organisations can be listed here, which offers the picture to others.
It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer protection against misuse. everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change these, in the picture embedded metadata. for individuals this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.
The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digitised; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.

Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same as can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called New Media.
Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.
To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated carefully and you can't trust you for more than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.
CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write much more reliable.
This is why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & so on;
For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which seems to work miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.
Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.
Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-expropriate format. after that, read the media with a description, date & author and store it on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.
Diskette drive your statistics for yourself. your manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: diskette study
Electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot determine these errors. some errors identified by SMART indicate the imminent failure. these are in particular read errors and publishing counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.
This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power loss before you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.
While most electrical devices don't make much noise, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money.
The most widespread protection against power peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember, however, that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.
If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.
Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used on your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as they can also reach a surge voltage. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection devices that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.
If you have a laptop then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.
While overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.
In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power outage occurs. this gives you the option to save your data and run the system orderly. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.
Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security against disruptions to this. high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 cost, A 500W UPS you can get for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday.
The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under & Linux, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.
They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.
The solutions are therefore only suited as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution.
Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional variant provides you more, in the case of Flickr. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should only be verified in reality.
From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. data transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed storage.
The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.
The worst part is that you don't tell you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these errors remain undiscovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. nobody seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer.
Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they create interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.
Even if you are not particularly affected by broadcasting problems, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of mistakes a year already in 2010.
ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.
Oracle launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS used and is also available for & Linux; it is not yet part of the kernel.
Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems. for notebooks, the portion of thefts is 50%.
Data loss due to virus is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.
Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most common file systems. you will find a very good English article here.
Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.
Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.
Digital cameras sensors are 1-2 stops of aperture from fundamental physical boundaries. this means that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far from this border.
Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result, the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.
A 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so don't worry anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before making any other dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or resizing the size of hard drives.
Suppose you make your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning bolt will have you luck if the drive wasn't connected at the moment.
A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft disasters: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern an entire room or the complete house.
Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.
There is another advantage of physical separation: as already stated above, a common reason for a data loss despite backing up the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.
Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.
Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.
Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time such a backup has been made. this backup comes to a versioning system the next with the exception that it is only sampled and not ongoing.
Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync copies only the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.
Backup important images directly after you have saved them to your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.
This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of your working files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.
Themes: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, rediscovering images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.
So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:
Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate during the time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.
This question should actually be answered based on the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.
Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.
On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.
Scaling is the print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.
Let's assume that you have scaled the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:
Check with the dmesg command to see if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it.
& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # resize2fs / dev / sdb
Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not exist any software that can read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be simpler from year to year.
GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.
PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store Gamma- and Chromaticity data for improved color allocation for heterogeneous platforms.
TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (default). however, with some cameras you can save your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.
DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open frame format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed due to the need to unify the camera image formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and commits to the use of metadata. a handful of camera creators now provide DNG and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.
This is perhaps one of the reasons why to replace 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that stands for XML / RDF.
Many photographers prefer to archive the original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP can do this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems with the connection between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to gain widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.
Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.
Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your shell archive. this feature is not yet implemented.
For a delicate processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. they may be cut off by other programs.
Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them into web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;
The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitized; to add a photo to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.
To use your digital camera with & digitio; to use, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and switch it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.
When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.
Before you download the photos on your computer, you might need the camera information about each entry. with the properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.
This dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.
The metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturers "Remarks, GPS, etc. this information is the same as the main window of & digitised in the metadata sidebar; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.
The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from All. this downloads all photos of their camera to a single album in & digikam;. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.
If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired ones using the standard selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. download the Selected button as long as you have selected some photos.
If your camera supports this, a new option is available. these images have not yet been edited by & digikam; download. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.
When you use the All Download or Selected buttons, a dialog will appear where you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab. you can find details on folder sorting in the My Albums tab. then select the destination album from the list and press OK.
After selecting the finish album, press OK, and & digikam; load the photos from the camera to the album.
Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete all delete button. if you just want to delete some, then you must select them first and then delete the selected ones.
Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera; the photos will not be moved to & kde; they will be completely deleted before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera, you should do so via the camera menu, as this is much faster.
Cameras use as file names frequently not meaningful names for the photos. the file names are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you upload photos of different recordings into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the filename.
In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.
The options During the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two apply the data on the author in the section of default car identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.
If you want a different date format than the default format, for example, you can use the prefix photo% Y%% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. add the option Date & Time to do so. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.
If you use the option camera file names, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase when you download it. or in uppercase, if you prefer.
The new file name, which & digicode; for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.
& digitize; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during the download. not all cameras provide this information ready. in the section bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.
The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, it leaves & digitized; the photo in original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.
If your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken, it can be used to create sub-albums in the target album. these sub-albums are based on the image data. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section on the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos.
This option is normally switched off, and in this case, and digitising; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based baskets on the bottom of the window.
The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is to download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & node; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file using the default & kde methods.
After the image selection is done, ask & digitid; you where the images are to be uploaded. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.
GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be calculated by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.
Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatically recording the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.
If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can use a click to open a browser which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam, send users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.
The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. so, the question is more, how the data comes into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, over a reworking of the GPS data and picture files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and finally about manual input of known places.
As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.
Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony
Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical mapping.
There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can use the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto
If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool from Phil Harvey. it uses the predefined coordinates created by maps.google.
Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.
& digitiy; try to give you so much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that change & edit the behavior. to access these settings, you need to edit the Edit Settings menu; set up. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.
Select action can be displayed on Embedded Preview or start image editing. you lay down the default behavior of & digikam; note if you click on an entry in the main view.
This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.
Author title is a synonym for author's footer: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. this may be designations like e.g. contracted photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description to the author field, this must also be filled.
Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency like e.g. Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as these are the picture other & quot; & quot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.
The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digitized; imported without getting lost.
Save image captions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this way your captions can also be read by other image viewers.
The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor is placed in the main window above a file. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.
& # 160; digitised; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitised; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.
You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.
The settings of the & digiplug's brightness can be set to the default values on this page. however, whenever you open the luminaire these settings will be turned on. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In all image size, you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.
By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.
Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the image. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.
With Chroma subsampling it means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance density than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.
With the PNG-compression option you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG excuses a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data requires more time for training and unpacking. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression.
The TIFF file option allows you to compress the default resolution algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect image quality since the default algorithm works without loss.
With the Lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning.
In earlier versions of & digikam, image processing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image processing settings.
The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option draws a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.
If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.
This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.
This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the SLR cameras. for other cameras this option is ignored.
The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as a continuous white. use the setting to solve some unusual results, as it displays the pointed lights in various rose tones. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.
This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as saturated as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw attempt to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.
When you select the reconstruct option, you will have the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each picture.
Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it a little higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done in the image options of the & digikam; -image processing. in order to keep the time for the demo-icing be small, you should proceed conservatively.
A deosainvoicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data obtained from the color-filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as a CFA interpolation or color structure.
& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogener Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges.
If you are familiar with the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction as it is performed during raw conversion.
A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information from one color space to the other is to translate the colors as precisely as possible.
Behavior Issues when an image is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start.
Color Profile Folder Click here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digitize; examines this folder then during startup.
Settings of the ICC profiles You have the possibility & quot; default source; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.
The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color does not manage the entire screen.
The input profiles should match the camera creamer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon that do not contain color mapping or gamma correction. at present, dcraw gamma doesn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color mapping yourself.
There are other options such as the Soft Proof Profile, which you can emulate as your image would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you print image since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be manually adjusted instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.
For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. therefore here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:
The Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.
KIPI is the & node; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digitizing; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.
If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and they will be removed by & digiti. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview.
Shortcuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.
Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.
The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad.
On the right-hand side there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on, and in the image display mode. below are the port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage is supported.
At the lower end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.
To use your digital camera with & digitised, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and switch it on.
Check if & digitized; the camera recognizes automatically. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.
You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all here.
With the confirmation dialog for moving > images in the garbage bins, you can adjust & edit the conversation; when deleting a photo in an album, you will find more details in the sections clearing a photo and deletion of an album.
The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly applied by & digitized; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries, otherwise you need to save the changes using the button change button.
You can also display & edit the display of the welcome screen; under certain circumstances it speeds up & digitising;.
The Set Beim Start to search for new photos forcing & digitized; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, ask & Edit; you if it should delete it from the database.
Various color schemes can be in & digitised; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected in Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:
These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.
& digitio; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correcting and improving. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item display / edit.
The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiti. so you may not be part of your distribution. further information on the KIPI modules can be found in the Image Processing section.
A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.
A menu bar at the top and underneath the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.
The editing functions of the image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file or save the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the image.
You should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with File Save as.
As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Recover menu or using the Recover button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have taken from the photo since the last save.
Almost every action of image editing can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo by editing back and / or restoring by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.
If you frequently use this, you should make the shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.
If you press the & LMB; press the Retrieve or Recover button on the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will be undone or restored in between.
Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.
You can enter into the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.
To adjust a picture to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor
View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you don't want this, you can change it in & Edit settings dialog. you can view it from & Edit; main window. see the Setting section for setting up the image editing pane.
If you want to print the current image, you can select the Print image from the File menu and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.
From the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sentences. whole screen widths can be printed from your selection. you just have to select the pictures with the standard methods and select Printer Setup from the File menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.
The & digitised; main window has a sidebar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:
Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin.
In the label view, you can enter or insert labels with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.
IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are reshaped. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.
After you have commented on it, you can either use the Apply button or simply switch to the next picture, the captions will then be saved.
There is a button next to the user button. this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always performed if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.
The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.
The evaluation is written in the IPTC-field. the coding follows the scheme in the table below:
The review view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used before.
The keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered keyword. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this skill is especially useful if you have many keywords.
The input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.
Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords in an image are stored in the IPTC keyword keyword.
If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is applied only to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a keyword, please read the section keyword Filter.
The keyword Filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used on the right, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.
You can also draw and discard key words. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.
In the top example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands for None keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog prompts if this keyword should be set.
This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.
If you have created a rule with and realize that it should be one or more, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and the control area.
(1): the entry specified in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.
(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.
You can, for example, specify an advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options:
If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button. the options then look like this:
Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution.
This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s specific implementation.
The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.
If the theme comes to color management, everyone would like to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result.
If your picture workflow fulfils all six criteria specified below, you do not need to worry about color management.
You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)
Your only other picture editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.
So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy, why should you use another color space and have to worry about color manpower?
A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.
If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's Excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.
Do I have to uninstall my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?
Yes! whether you are working in sRGB color space or not, you have to uninstall your monitor because sRGB means that your; onitor is sRGB. if you are working as sRGB color space, then you either have to stick your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.

This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.
The functions normalize, balance, automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic correction to automatically make the most of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.
Normalize: this method scales the denier values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.
Compare: this method adjusts the intensity channel of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in a picture or destroys it.
Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.
Enhance contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.
The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to complete the white balance of a photo.
The white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 bits per color. so if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will fall better.
This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it using the menu entry colour white balance of image processing.
The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.
The target image preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.
To the right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.
The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dim down.
To play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then click on the image preview to use the color selected to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.
In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:
The Overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.
The buttons Save as and Load make this exactly. each setting of the white balance you have set can store it in a text file and load it later.
The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.
You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit code is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computation time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.
This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of blank images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be used to consult the chapter on color management.
Another important tool is to find color grading in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and also allow you to save your settings so that you can use them for several photos at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and you always need the same correction.
A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gradation tool that you will find under color gradation in the menu.
The & digicode; tool color effects provides you with four color effects, a solar integration effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.
In times of chemical processing, it was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to fine adjust this interesting effect.
The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically feasible. a further upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.
This is an example of the solar integration effect. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). the applied intensity lies at 30%.
The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making the paint brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellished many photos.
The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.
The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.
Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photo. you can preview the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.
If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too great saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness and saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.
Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool tone correction is located to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of sliders for the application described here.
The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into them and they can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left hand represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.
The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the sliders and watch out how the picture changes.
On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated according to the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.
Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear narrative is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.
Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma-values.
The three color pinprits can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.
Output values: the output values allow selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to interactively change the output values as with the input values. the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a light image as background while something else is visible in the foreground.
Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.
Save and load: these buttons can be used to store the set values in the file system and load them later. for this, the Gimp Level format is used.
If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, Medium and Sonnentöne. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.
The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.
Below is an example of adjusting input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).
On the left hand side half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:
Modifier channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel to be modified by the module:
Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, most of the time the linear mode is the most meaningful. for images with large areas of constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode also helps.
For example, if you move a curve part to the right, e.g. the light sounds, then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that darker the image pixels.
To preview the original photos is a red marking. if you move this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.
Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly that. any curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.
When you create this method and the three color pipette buttons, you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, mid- and Sonnentöne. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.
The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel pixels are found, the combined result is displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you will only see the effect in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.
Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. silhouet- and Sonnentöne was set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).
The channel mixer of the & digitised; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.
The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image editing.
With the channel selection box you can select the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and cut. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.
The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram shows you the corresponding color value.
Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable luminance, the image will retain the general brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.
Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour. the color is made of small noise artifacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose spatial pattern in each channel looks different. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour first.
The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.
The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.
Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is activated. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2).
Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.
Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Pan F Plus, Ilford XP2 Super
Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. similarly, like the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.
Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.
Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daytime. similarly, like the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.
Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.
Sepiaton: creates warm light and medium sounds while it adds a little bit of cold in the shears. this is very similar to the process of the bleaching of a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiece. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 ccoin (tm) sepiafilter.
With the & digicode; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.
By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a Pop Art Portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.
Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.
A paper text effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified (2) can be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.
With the & digiplug; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.
Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep your attention is to put the picture into a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye. under Picture Frames, the module can be started from image processing.
Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. through the picture, the image is surrounded with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bottled.
Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.
The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio beforehand.
With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also goes in several places if you need it.
This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from color space and character set with its properties as you need. the larger the image, the larger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.
Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button OK. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.
Using the & digicode; tool template you can apply a template over a picture.
The menu image template apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture.
For the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the & digikam, please send an email in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.
If you are using this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the stencil files. these settings will be scheduled for the next start.
After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder will appear. selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates.
Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.
Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.
Smaller: this button resets the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.
Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.
Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.
& digitio; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.
Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces grainy images, especially in dark areas.
Blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not sharpen bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright from Winston Chang.
Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.
Photos without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitizing process needs to merge colours with only minimal differences to one color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically require more after-sharpening than normal cameras for private users.
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.
Some scanners apply a field of sharpness already during the image reading. if you disable them, you will get control of your image.
In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can go to the Correcting Door menu entry.
You should be careful with this, since the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. generally, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.
Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharpening. use the tool to soften with the menu entry Correcting softness and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.
The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.
The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.
There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grenades are generated near sharp edges.
The radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.
The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original.
The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, you can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. in this way areas with a soft switching between the tones are excluded from sharpen and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.
This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred mask has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.
The & digicode; tool refocussing refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected litter-filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.
This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filaging. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is using a blurred mask. refocus reaches usually better results than blurred mask. refocus can run it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.
In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'sche fold. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also depends on the swelling pixelae that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauss's fold is even strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes unwanted results.
Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results.
Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.
Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality becomes very poor. a usable value is 0.03.
Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß sharpness. use this parameter if your blur is Gauß 'sh. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero otherwise you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.
Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the die size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge. however, note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.
The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you set will then be saved for later and can then be loaded.
Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.
Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that many operations that are not visible immediately, but leave unpleasant artefacts later.
If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.
Generally unknown masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood being used as sharpening.
In theory, the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details.
Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:
The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.
For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.
The controller smoothes the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.
The tinink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.
The tool error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.
The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.
This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available presets are listed below:
If you want to fine-adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.
Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogenous regions and keep details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening should be subordinated afterwards.
Directional dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value draws near to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD loafs, a high value will produce wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.
Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value to the degree of noise in your image.
Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.
Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.
Angle-amplitude da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. be aware that small angles generate a long term. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.
Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value less than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.
Linear interpolation use: the more of the quality that you receive by selecting this option is only minimal. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to let it out.
The buttons Save as and Load make this exactly. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later.
Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.
Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip. the original picture is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).
The & digitization; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.
This tool provides selectable picture filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.
If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.
The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.
In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain at the default settings.
A radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blurb the image. the area indicated by the radius is moved over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors are cleared.
Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch behind the filter to detect luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are removed. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again.
Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, it cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.
Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.
Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process of the image settings checked.
Gamma: controls the gamma-tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly smoked. however, it also allocates the shadow areas.
Damping: controls the adjustment of phase damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is on its minimum, noise and phase jitter may occur at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this.
Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all noise reduction parameters that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.
This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied using the default settings.
Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpening a picture. use this tool for softening with the menu entry Correcting softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.
The & digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.
This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures.
The same algorithm can be used for color and texture creation. the texture exposure is performed with a different tool of image error correction. the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.
JPEG artefacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artifact quot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.
The buttons Save as and Load make this exactly. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.
Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. it can still last very long and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.
Below you can restore like a photo with uniform noise reduction will be restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.
Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures have been reduced to an old color photo created with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanner illumination and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).
The & digicode; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera according to eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.
Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.
This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel"; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.
Load this file into the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.
If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.
First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard shows the last dark image and loads it automatically in the next session.
The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.
Select an area to view the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:
Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.
Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1 dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.
Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.
Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.
Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).
The & digicode; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.
Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor field. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.
But it also has drawbacks. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may increase the necessary closure time in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, otherwise blurred effects caused by movement.
With the large exposure areas of today's film and color and grey depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.
With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.
Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity damping at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, equivalent to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.
Luminosity, Contrast and Gamma Settings: editing a picture with the vignetting correction reduces the luminous intensity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.
If you want a finer readjusting of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.
This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a denser and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.
The & digitization; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.
This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.
The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.
The coefficient of the third degree coefficient has a similar rounding effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.
The coefficient of fourth degree corrects the distant corners opposite the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.
General: this value controls the strength of distortion of second degree. with negative values, sound distortion can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion can be corrected.
Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion 4. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lentils, the 'Corner Parameters have the opposite sign of the parameter general.
Zoom: this value resizes the image size and creates a correction first grader. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.
Clear: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.
To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.
The sound or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before any trimming or size changes. the best way to do this is to perform this correction first. if you want to trim an image and then perform a sound-shaped correction, the effect is apparently the wrong.
To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal help line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display dotted lines. move it to an important location such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.
If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black edges. you can cut them with the cutting tool in the menu Transformers Cutting out of image editing or using the Zoom knob of this dialog.
For most pictures, the sound-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives, such as shots from the front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.
This is an example of the sound-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).
The algorithm is based on a method for simulating the infrared film of the GimpGuru.org web page that is accessible from this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.
In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.
Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). check the Add Perform Film Selection option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows become white as snow!
Because the filter mixes colour channels for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.
This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the sharpeners.
The & digiplug; Filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.
The effect of the film gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postpone back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loosened from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.
With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, adjusted to ISO 2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.
This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that processed the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.
The & digicode; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.
The & digicode; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.
There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smooths controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the hinge.
This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with (1) and the compiler is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and smoothing 17.
The digitised; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbonic sketch. images of their gradients are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you have chosen to sketch out. these would be good pictures to start with.
There are two sliders with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothness).
This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.
The & digiplug; Filter engraving influences your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.
The & digicode; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.
The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.
This is an example of the engraving file. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.
With this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.
Number 1: divides the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.
Waves 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1 the image here is distorted with another version of glass blocks.
Some effects need long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Cancel.
With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.
Zoom Zoom: blurred the image along star shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.
Radial blur: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.
Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back into the background.
Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: taken from a car or train, camera.
Softening blurring: blurred the image into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.
Sharpness: blurred the image by a random shift of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.
Intelligent blur: finds the color in the picture and blurred it without changing the rest.
Mosaic: divide the photograph into rectangular cells and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value.
Some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Cancel.
The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural to your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.
Drop size allows to change the size of the drops. since the drop size doesn't grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drop on the picture.
You can stick with & digitized; image editing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.
This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.
If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or rotating. the tools for this can be found in the Transformers menu or mirroring.
Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.
The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.
If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.
Change the tool to size using a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.
Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitised; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo blister was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.
You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:
Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new dimension.
Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, because it is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.
The buttons Save as and Load are used exactly for this purpose. each stutter for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later.
Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can still last very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.
You can see below an example of photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear expansion of the standard.
Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. editing allows you to create a photo with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and raising the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.
When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo looks after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply dragging the left mouse button.
Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the Ctrl key to edit image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl + + X). use the Save file or save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo.
In the preview pane, you can change the rectangle size by dragging the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved.
The tool According to the aspect ratio allows you to specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the transverse format of the width is always assigned.
The tool According to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.
At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.
At the bottom of the dialog you can set the area for cutting on the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.
The tool According to the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.
The settings of the coaster help allow you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:
Harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in the same harmonious triangles on the diagonal.
Golden mean: the golden centre is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the metalwork sheets of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we perceive as beautiful.
The golden divide is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden divide at all times when you put together your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.
The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center.
The golden centre provides more liquid help lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:
The Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your goal. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye by the image. this kind of composition leads the viewer's view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.
Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is directed at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.
The golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be inserted a static object dynamic.
If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try placing your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.
The horizontal mirror and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.
With the button colour you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible.
The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.
If you make a photo then it's easy that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with & digiGo; image processing and the tool free rotation.
Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right.
For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.
After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformers Cutting out of the image processing.
An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatic Cutting function. select one of the following options:
The Anti-aliasing option smooths the image slightly after rotation. note the above warning.
All perspective transformations are carried out at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.
To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:
New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels.
New Height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels.
Top left corner: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.
Top right corner: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.
Angle Left Down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left hand corner of the transformed area.
Angle Right Down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.
After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly smeared. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.
After adjusting the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformation Cutting out of the image processing.
The shoring tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal shift, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via Transformers scissors.
Shaper your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are set to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.
To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is blended. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shoring tool to adjust your image.
After you have done the shearing, the picture gets a little bit blurred. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two formulations producing twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.
After the shearing, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is to cut the picture with transformation Cutting out of the image processing.
& digitiy; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitized.
Due to this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF under it.
& digitio; displays only files in formats known to you. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension listed in the list is & digitized, edit the file in image editing. you can change this list of file extensions which & digikam; accept. in the configuration section, you will find more information about this.
Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digitized; supports both formats.
Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. in doing so, redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way.
JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free if specified in the settings.
If you want to learn more about the raw image format, please refer to Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour's very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with & digitised image converter.
& digitio; supports loading of raw images only with the dcraw program, which is included in & digiti. with this, more than 200 raw file formats are supported. all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by & digitio; supported:
Many digital cameras support the recording of short movies. these clips are often saved in the AVI- or MPEG format. & digitised; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built-in options to view or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digitising; the & kde; settings to play movies use to start the program to play.

KIPI module that exports a series of images to a KML structure. KML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth.
If you change steps 4 and 5, what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good, then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module.
Many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in & digiti. contain your description here.
All image processing tools like sharpening, softness, noise reduction, refocussing, unsharp mask, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture Application quot; in this dialog:
(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:
Split vertically without duplicates. the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.
Horizontal splitting without duplicates. the upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.
The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.
The upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the effect of the filter.
'mouse over' style: shows the preview if the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original.
(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to show overexposure and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.
(3): the frame to choose the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.
(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values.
The Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:
Photo Properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data come from the EXIF data when they are available.
This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Mini program. you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out or hold it hold and move it. move it while clicking the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this requires of course that your images contain geo data.
& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.
The palettes that are installed by & kde can either apply to the entire system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your Personal Folder for & kde; -Settings and Hot Custom color and last used colors.
In the dialog box, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files.
The cursor is displayed in the Pallet view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.
It shows the colour next to it. the color is described in the Pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.
It can also be used for selecting. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.
If the check box Beim cursor is activated under the button Color, the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwritten another; depending on whether the mode overwrite mode has been selected.
A selection created in this way as described in the last section can be used together with the copy, cut and paste operations.
Coloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the shares of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character if another color follows. if there are three values in the clipboard, these can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit;
The colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dragged with the mouse.
Select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side.
& kgraphically; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has been no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz; includes, are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; -programs with few functions.
The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.
& kgraphically; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. & graphviz; -programs are free layout programs. & kgraphically; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:
Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (such that a change in the graph in & kate; the graph will be re-calculated and shown in & kgraphically;)
Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphically; in a & kate; component
Loading large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 nodes and a hack to present more than these nodes)
Other required software: & kgraphically; is a & kde; -program, which presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for representing the graphs.
The main window displays open graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphically; without an argument, the main window is empty as shown in the lower screen shot. in this case the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list contains the last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.
After you have selected one or more & Dot; -Files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:
As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.
Using the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & old; -key);
The zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.
If the currently loaded file is changed by another program, the following window will appear:
You can choose whether the graph should be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphically. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kgraphically; set up... use, see also.
If you open a graphene file outside a running & kgraphviewer; instance; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & graphical viewer; instance, or display the graph to be loaded in a sub-window of the already running instance.
As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog.
During the program start, you can open all the graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as change it later.
You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.
If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled in by the respective sections of the graph.
Page preview with graphs distributed across multiple pages without header and with a different font
The Erneut loading page provides the ability to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.
The Open page opens the ability to set the behavior of & kgraphically; you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that each time it is requested.
The session management page gives you the ability to specify the start behavior of & kgraphically. you can set a default behavior (open or not the files of the last session) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards.
The context menu, which normally appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBN; opens up more possibilities:
Here you can choose from different & graphviz; Layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the & graphviz website, are:
It produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directed graphs. the algorithm produces the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.
The & neato; -algorithm is the standard for unwatered graphs. it produces representations according to the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.
The & FDP; -algorithm produces a springboard layout for unwatered graphs. it uses the Fructman-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-point trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.
The & Circo; -algorithm classifies the nodes in a circular manner according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.
Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphene file as a parameter, and specify the calculated layout of the graph after stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.
Determines the type of graph (directed or unexecuted) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for ungerized graphs).
If this setting is enabled, the overview will be shown if necessary. otherwise, it will not be shown and the positioning menu is inactive.
Displays the What is the mouse pointer. click on a & GUI; -element with this mouse pointer to get more help on this item (if any).
A list of changes is available at this address and in the file ChangeLog in the source folder of the source repository.
& kgraphviewer; is a & node program that uses the & graphviz; tools for rendering. it requires the following program packages:
A special setup is not necessary to use & kgraphically. in the Settings menu, you will find more options.
The main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections: the main toolbar, the toolbar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol.
Create a new icon. if the current file has been modified, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. afterwards, a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template, or whether you want to start anew from scratch.
Restores the last undo-back step. if you did not make a step backward, this function is disabled.
Adds the contents of the clipboard as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).
Sets the current symbol in grey scales. this can create colors that do not match those of the icon palette of & kde.
Does not change the symbol, but sets the current drawing color to the color of the point you click.
The status bar shows you the current actions. from left to right, it displays the x and y coordinates of the current pixel, the size of the current drawing area, the magnification factor and the current number of colors of the symbol.
Adds the contents of the clipboard as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).
Open Settings & Kiconedit; Setting up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols, background and symbol grid.
With the buttons Add..., Edit... and Delete, you can change the templates for standard file, source file, Compressed File & etc.
Choose Transparent Pixel or View Lineale and insert colour: or a chessboard as a transparency display. you can also adjust the size for the chess board: the Karos on Small, Medium and Great as well as the Color 1: and Color 2: select.
Reading the KIPI module images provides tools to read and store new images.
This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:
Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sani project or another source such as Video Streams. to do this you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.
When you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. select here the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.
After that the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default defaults of your own to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button Scan. the estimated file size is displayed in the right lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find further information.
Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.
After you have pressed the button scanning you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window for setting the options of the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore create very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.
You can create screenshots after you have selected in the Import > Screen Photo... menu. a window appears where you can adjust the different screen settings:
Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.
If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have picked up the complete desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.
The delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts. if you need to switch to other work surfaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.
After the screenshot has been created, the Options dialog appears with the options described above.
The KIPI module calendar currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.
This module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K3b burning program. you can simply select the archived albums. an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation. also, the Autoplay option is available for the Windows platforms.

The KIPI module duplicate images search is a tool for searching for duplicate images in your picture collection.
If you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI team mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.
Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr allows you to send photos to people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family around the world.
The Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.
If you are using the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so, it is your ID to Flickr. a browser is started to allow you to login to Flickr.
After the successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after successful registration.
Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.
When the Export module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions that the module shows. currently, you need write permissions. the module currently does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.
The button photos should be pressed once you have all other options set. with this button you can select the photos that you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, uploading the photos to Flickr server starts.
The Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as tags during upload.
With the Options Public, Friends and Famillie, you can set the permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.
If you change the option Changes the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered with Maximum size.
The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is modified so that the aspect ratio remains constant.
The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
The KIPI module gallery-export has no documentation currently. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI team mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.
The KIPI geographic location allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF catchwords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.
The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.
To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.
Image Geographical localization correlation. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.
Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the dialog shown above will then be loaded. to make a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data which were recorded at the same time at the same locations as the pictures of your camera.
When the file loads, an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS Spurdata is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set up your camera sequence here.
The maximum time difference indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.
If you have no track data from a location for pictures, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the pictures in this area.
The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlated to interpolate.
The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog box itself the coordinates of one call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.
The location can also be found and reset with the displayed map. select the region you want and increase sie.Do this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.
Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.
The KIPI Module Pictures Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.
This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.
The tab allows you to select all the albums you want to export to HTML. you only need to select the albums you want to export. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.
The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you click on a picture, a new page is opened in which the picture is displayed.
The Album defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.
If you have selected the JPEG File Format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new pictures.
With Other color depth you can change the default color depth. this also affects the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.
The tab Previews allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for the thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.
A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.
If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production. the web browser will automatically start at the end to view the preview of the gallery.
The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.
The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zoom or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.
After the start, an image is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.
The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.
This module allows to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata for the actions below.
The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size is increasing as there is no compression of the color information. this can be found e.g. in PNG format.
The KIPI digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.
The KIPI digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI team mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.
The KIPI module metadata editor does not currently have any documentation. if you wish to change this situation, please contact the KIPI mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org.
With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.
This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please take a look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.
The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.
The MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the Packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.
All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select a background color for slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player.
First you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that you can start creating the module via Tools MPEG Diashau.
The images selected by you are then listed in the Portfolio section, where you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.
After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.
In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display an image. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.
The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep mpg as far as possible.
If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can use the button coding to start generating the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now get a coffee fast or in all rest and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.
If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages using the button settings on the bottom right.
The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve you or print directly with the Gimp module for direct printing.
With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three JPEG, TIFF or PPM formats.
The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera producer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.
First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.
You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further process the image later.
A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera operates in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.
Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.
The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.
If you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.
If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information.
If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.
Batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.
The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.
This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:
This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.
This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can zoom or enlarge the image.
Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.
Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format.
Non-proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.
Premix: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.
With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.
After you started the module, the image window will be displayed with the pictures you selected. you can add more images via the button Add Pictures. the last selected image will display a preview on the right side.
You can also drag and drop images to the images list to add them to the list of images to be sent.
With the button Remove pictures, the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent.
After you have selected all the images, you can click the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you just have to add the addresses and the subject.
Don't mind sending too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.
The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.
Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.
If you are using the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.
After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and added to the mail.
The PNG format in the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.
If you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original files will be added to the images to be sent.
When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.
After starting the module advanced Diashau, a window with questions like you want to display your slideshow will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.
The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphics card, as otherwise the slide show will be very slow.
The file name display option ensures that the file name of the pictures is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.
The Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually do it with Esc; Cancel.
The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.
Between the pictures the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!
There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly choose another effect for each transition between the images.
During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.
With this toolbar you can pause the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop slide show.
At the lower left edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.
The KIPI module time & date adjusted does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI team mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.
The KIPI module Background is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the work surface.
This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.
Once you have finished your pictures and videos with annotations, you can use & kphoto album; browse them, see picture. as you can see by comparing them with the image, there are now in each group, so in persons, places and in group keyword entries.
In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course look at the current thumbnails.
If you click on the characters with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.
If you select another person, only the images are displayed on which both people are to be seen. through this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few images.
If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can display with thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.
In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphoto album; however for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.
To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right-hand side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can choose which view you want to use for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable images for your keywords).
However, you need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image view window (described in more detail) and select the categories editor in the context menu. here you can select the image for the appropriate person. in the View Window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or clipped.
When you enter the search entry in the main window, a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.
If you enter a string into the label or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date may either be a part of the total date, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.
With the options in the lower part of the window you can search all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here's for images on which Jesper but not Anne Helene are depicted.
This is the User Manual for & kphoto album;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:
Go to the Homepage of & kphoto album; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.
Start & kphoto album; and in the first dialog select the demo, if you start & kphoto album; for the first time, or select in the Help menu entry kphoto album; -demo. after that, some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphoto album; try.
If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the Homepage of & kphoto album; as a coherent HTML document to download.
At the bottom of the main window of & kphoto album; see the timeline. a picture of this bar is shown here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays date statistics about the images in your database.
The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 minute sections.
The timeline can be interactively used in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview opinion from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview pane) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane.
You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select a range, you will only see pictures of that period in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.
& kphoto album; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your pictures. the one is in & kphoto album; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following section of the User Manual, the in & kphoto album; integrated version described, you can create through the File HTML... menu.
Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout, and Objects.In the following each area is described in more detail.
First enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file is supposed to contain later. on kphoto album; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.
Next, select if a & kphoto album; export file is to be created on the overview page.
Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without a description. for example, that & kphoto album; currently all images are exported. therefore, you can not use this setting to hide specific images from specific viewers.
In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.
At the bottom of the page, you can set up various resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, do not download images that have a resolution of 1600x1200, for example.
The viewer on your site can change the resolution you specified at any time. so, he can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get a larger image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.
In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.
The best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.
First you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to specify the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:
After you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible for viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages have been created. otherwise, the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.
If the HTML files you create are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, properly work, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.
The settings described above have all three related to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, its name can be set in the output folder.
If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphoto album; together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you already spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you need to do with & kphoto album; this work does not once again.
With & kphoto album; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others to your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.
There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.
You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file.
An external .kin file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches for the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML export.
The following describes the dialog for exporting images that you can export via the File Export menu.
The most important option of this dialog is whether to deal with internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:
In the Manually Copy option, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.
With the option Automatically copy & kphoto album, copy & kphoto album; the images automatically for you.
.kim files are normal Zip files. since most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you still want this, simply select the Export file option.
The last option on this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.
When you select a file with the extension .kin from the web browser or from the File menu file..., will & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.
The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images should be copied.
It may be that you type the category "Personnel" (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database. that's why you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the file to be imported and what categories they are in your database.
In the fourth step you can synchronize the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example for this can be seen in the image.
It has to be easy to browse and look at pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different sets of pictures & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.
In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) specifying the information about your images, about (2) the browsing and watching, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.
KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today your videos are also taken care of. in many places in this manual talk about images, but frequently this also includes videos.
& kphoto album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, such as Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS.
& kphoto album; remembers the folder where your images are stored and automatically restores them in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphoto album, so you can start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphoto album; with option -c. as an example: kphoto album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.
About the menu entry settings kphoto album; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphoto album; in the following section of the User Manual the various settings are explained.
On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can use by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.
It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.
You can see the dialog used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.
In the Options section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.
In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.
& kphoto album; divides its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.
The modules can be called through the Module menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules possess a help page that you can access through the module itself.
Since the modules of several applications are used together with each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphoto album; therefore, you should test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures using the & kphoto album demo < userinput\ > or using the Help menu. don't say I haven't warned you!
The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphoto album; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.
The biggest difference between & kphoto album; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their pictures into albums. even if & kphoto album; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & kphoto album.
In doing so simulates & kphoto album; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment.
Next to the current album & kphoto album; the modules also need to pass a list of albums.
If & kphoto album; s Browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.
Or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category Persons, & kphoto album; do so, so whether you have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module.
Since some modules with & kphoto album are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.
On the picture you can see an example for a start screen as soon as you start & kphoto album; start with your own pictures.
As you are used to from any other KDE application, you'll see a menu and toolbar at the top. currently, it doesn't contain too much information, as you have not yet entered information about your images. in the section, we will return to this window, but first click on the entry images that will give you an overview of all existing images.
One of the main functions of & kphoto album; is the ability to comment each image with annotations. this includes information about the people on the picture, where the picture was taken. you can use each image separately or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, all pictures are portrayed in Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.
All these notes may be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you are interested, you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.
In view, you can see three lists with a text box by defining people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphoto album; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.
The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and the same 5-10 people are shown on all 50 pictures, you can move the names up to the top, find the persons faster and assign them.
If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting icon by date under the list.
If you have selected any comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add notes to them. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons below to preview the image at the top right.
If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.
Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the US. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.
On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the US as a supergroup. to show you it is an overboard, a special icon is displayed.
In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new super- or subcategory. additionally, you can also drag an entry to a category and put it there to make it a subcategory of this entry.
You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and dragging the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the pane area.
If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... that offers you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.
You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to view this window later, use the Options button... and then hide the window. this process can be seen in the picture.
When you select the entry images in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you don't have a filter set. an example for this can be seen here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.
If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as background image for your desktop.
Once you click on a picture, this will appear in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.
You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window will show you which you can see in the picture.
& kphoto album; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphoto album; namely pictures also without having stored on the hard drive. of course you have to save the pictures somewhere, so that & kphoto album; you can view & kphoto album; if not all required images can be downloaded from the hard drive.
Images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that & kphoto album; you can view these images as well. however, you can also not view these images with the image viewer.
As you can see, this feature requires you to extract and copy files from folders. & kphoto album; does not support you until now to ask for inserting the CD in question. so if you are hassle about how to avoid messing up your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it.
In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end there are those leftovers that you may want to make accessible to others. alternatively, you can control all the images that your little sister can see, and lock the menu entry Anything except current view.
With this you have set which pictures are to be hidden in the case of your little sister. if you give your laptop now to your little sister, simply select the menu item pictures to lock, thus exposing all images that you have locked.
It is also possible to specify a password which needs to be entered to unlock the pictures. to set up this password, simply select Password in the Privacy menu.
Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, everyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this kind of password protection is only used to prevent those who are with & kphoto album; not very familiar looking at private images.
The reason why you spend all your pictures with & kphoto album; manage and describe hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphoto album; via a picture _ and video viewer. this you can start from the preview as described in.
The viewer can see you in. he shows, of course, the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.
If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is to be displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.
Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see matching entries for this. so, if you click Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and Anne Helene then.
If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.
If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slides. & kphoto album; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and plus respectively minus.
A very useful capacity of the viewer of & kphoto album; is to be able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.
When you use the viewer you can drag the image into and out. to zoom in, simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button you can zoom out again. with the minus button you can zoom out in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.
With the dot button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the Freedom key setting the zoom so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.
Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are coming in and out using the plus and minus button.
You can rotate the image using the rotary functions from the context menu. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image using the menu item Notes from the context menu.
If you view pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can browse the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to mark only the picture and view other images.
Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one.
For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to mark images with features while watching them. features include the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters. in this section you can see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.
As soon as you have attributes to your images, they are available in your browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add all at once with annotations. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.
Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you can view categories in the Instruction screen, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the character after the image has been selected. you can see this here:
Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you will allow you to paint photo album; on the picture.
The batch is not saved with the image but in the database. in the way you can undo your gemstone later.
In you can see a picture on which was painted. to turn on the coloring mode of & kphoto album; select View on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.
To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have read and understood absolutely.
In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire-model views are displayed yellow.
You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the subproperty of an object already selected, as all the objects are already selected with the object.
To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.
If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to allow you to choose the right position:
Delete selected objects from the scene by deleting either from the menu bar to edit or from the right mouse button context menu.
If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply, or discard the changes with Cancel.
If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can invoke the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with the help.
You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL User documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.
When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.
Click Preview in the Property View and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the texture you selected. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), check the box locally.
The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.
When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.
Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level selected in the toolbar.
& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.
If you don't like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it at will. you can also store multiple windows orders and simply switch between different arrangements.
To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.
To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.
If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the beginner right in the middle of another view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.
The last possible window arrangement are floating elevations: views that are not anchored in the main window. to trigger a view from the anchoring, drag the beginner to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left at the beginning bar.
To close a view click on the small cross in the beginning bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.
You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.
The current window view can be saved with the View window arrangement... Save. it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.
If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.
To render the current scene, click on Rendering The Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the render view scene.
A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.
If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or in the View Render menu, select the following dialog:
Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, meaning it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.
In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.
In combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.
If an image is rendered with just one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.
& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.
If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.
& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively because each pixel is divided over and over again and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.
If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray of pixels. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 additional points is calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.
The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:
Diff = abs (r. 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)
The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is split into 4 sub-pixels, which are monitored individually and evaluated for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.
Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.
The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.
On this card you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the related rays didn't hit any object.
Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason for it here.
To import a & Povray; -Scene, select the Import menu item... and select a file in the dialog box.
Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.
If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.
You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.
With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & povray; also insert.
The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene rendered. usually this is povray or x-povray.
If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set here the path to your translation and the version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 are supported.
& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. high-field data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.
The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.
The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.
The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type license plate.
You can set the object catch of the dots to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid seperately for shifts, scaling and rotation.
Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.
If you tick high level of detail for extended projection, all wire model views will be further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.
When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.
When you tick the floor, a ground is rendered beneath the objects. the floor is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.
When you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value in the Render modes section.
On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the window ordinance section, it will explain how to create and store window orders.
The Combination Field Standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.
The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.
Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.
The list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement. you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views with the Delete button.
The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you can anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a card card view together with the previous view and hovers the view not in the main window but creates a separate window.
So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners: a ball at one level.
But you should carefully consider the following warnings if you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:
If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black image.
If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black image.
If you have everything correctly installed, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:
Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.
You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.
& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item.
The wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you see this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.
The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see for more details.
Do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the View has control points to change the focus of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.
When you press the button, or press the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.
There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a box (insert Endlicher Boxes) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for solving this task.
& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as ground:
A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button Apply or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.
The wire model view now also shows the level, even if at the moment only as a finite final level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.
When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.
In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:
First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.
In both cases, a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now.
Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material, because you have to enter settings for the pigments yet. therefore always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.
If you don't see any color on the box and the ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then enter the preview.
The material for the floor is set right now. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:
In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):
In the object tree, select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:
You should be able to do this step by simply because you have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as easy to create as the floor:
In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or button icon), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the sphere would float above the ground as you moved the floor by one unit downwards.
Of course rendering now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.
Once you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already with the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:
Select first subitem and change the name for example in ball Pigment. click on ball Pigment, then choose Unicoloured and set the values as below:
But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing features:
Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.
The brightness and reflection settings already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:
You should now have a good impression of the possibilities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.
Raytracytracing is a Render method to produce a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.
When you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog have effects. thus, the scene pixels are processed for pixel.
As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.
In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.
Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;
Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.
If you already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and a disk space.
Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.
This menu entry can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene.
Repeat the last modified command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Undo.
Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.
In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the keyboard shortcut and the default behavior.
Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option to set default shortcuts for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.
Opens a dialog for setting up the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove Toolbars for & kpovmodeler; commands.
A bump mapping is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.
It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.
Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.
A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.
& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.
Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.
The use of & kufic show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBN; or the Return key.
You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all pictures should always use the same window.
If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or Esc.
In the Configuration - & Kuickshow dialog box, there are five flashcards. in three of them, general and editing and slide show, you can set the operation of & kuickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for each window.
If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can adjust further down. default is not full screen mode.
If this point is enabled, load & kuickshow; already the next picture in the folder, while you are still watching the current image. this reduces the delay when you select the next picture, and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.
This option stores & kuickshow; when hiring the name of the last opened folder. at the next start, it will open and show the show; this folder in the browser window.
Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the image, the background is filled with the selected color.
You can set & kuickshow; set up just a few of the file types that the program can also display.
This option is used to enlarge the display window to the full screen. this option is enabled as default.
Specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.
To change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field. the default is 3 seconds.
The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slide show is repeated until it is canceled by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field.
Here you can change the shortcuts for the different modes of & kuickshow; in the flashcards, short commands for the display window and shortcuts for the browser.
With this option, you can switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and the one-piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window.
Displays large icons for the files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short description.
Displays small icons for the files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short description.
Displays thumbnails for the files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short description.
The image decreases by 10%. the factor refers to the current size of the image.
Magnifies the image by 10%. the factor refers to the current size of the image.
Closes the display window for the pictures. & kuickshow; is also closed when no browser window is opened.
It is only useful if automatic scaling is enabled.
Open the input field for completion. enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for. if the file is found, it will be selected.
& showphoto; is a & kde; photo editing based on & digikam; image editing. & showphoto; is part of & digikam; project.
& showphoto; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools. you can use it to view your photos and make corrections and changes.
Like the rest of & kde; is & showphoto; an open source project. this means that the user accounts for at least problems and possible improvements.
& showphoto; makes it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements. wherever you are in the program, the menu contains an entry Reports you encounter problems or desires. this displays a dialog with a link. if you use this, your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes.
& showphoto; is a project supported by a community. that means that users and developers are helping each other. if you are a frequent user of & showphoto; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users soon. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.
The best start to join the showphoto; to participate is to join the developer mailing list. instructions to join the developer mailing list of & showphoto;.
& showphoto; tries to give you so much control over its workflows as possible. there are many options that change the behavior of & showphoto; you need to set up the settings dialog in the Settings menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.
In the area of exposure indicators, you can select the color displayed when the under- or overexposure indicator has been selected. skill-wise the colors with what you are supposed to indicate should be in contrast. underexposure should indicate a bright color and overexposure a dark color.
The main window of & showphoto; has a sidebar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions for the selected images. you can also find the same page bar in image editing. you can view it by clicking on one of the five tabs:
& skanlite; is an application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images.
& skanlite; is a simple application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images. & skanlite; can open a dialog for saving for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format.
You can check the status of your scanner's support on the SANE page by entering the necessary information on this search page: HTTP: / / www.sane-project.org / cgi-bin / driver.pl.
A standard scanner can be set in the command line of & skanlite; with the command skanlite -d [device name] in the terminal. if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified, a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened.
The user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner. Cancel & skanlite; quit.
The other settings contain more detailed driver options. & skanlite; (libksane) does not treat these options particularly.
To scan a picture, the user can start a previous scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan. the preview can be started by the preview button.
To better select the image, the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection. he can also adjust the zoom to fit the entire preview in the window.
When the image is selected, the final image can be read with the Scan button.
If you preview a preview in the settings before saving, then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below. if you are pressed, then the image will be saved and Schlie? en will lead to a breakout and you will get back to the main window.
The Settings button opens the name of the same name in front of the main window. you can change the most important settings here.
The user can view the image if desired before saving. in this case, the option must be selected before saving a preview. if this preview is not desired by the user, then the option must be selected.
This option allows them to select the way & skanlite; images can be selected. open dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image. if & skanlite; this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder will need to select Save without asking for a file name.
This setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without asking for a file name. if the images are saved after each scan, then this folder is used as standard for the dialog for saving. the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button...
This parameter defines an image prefix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving. the automatically saved image gets a numeric Suffix of each time a picture is saved. the string # # # is replaced by the numbers.
The user can adjust the image quality used to store. this value also changes the compression value when saving. if select the image quality, then the default value of Qt is used.
The button About starts the KDE help with the & skanlite; manual. the button About starts the KDE about dialog for & skanlite;. the button settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end & skanlite.
& skanlite; is licensed under the GPL and the libksane library used by & skanlite, under LGPL. attention: libsane is licensed under the GPL with an exception.
Below is a list of this shortcut and its function. the global keyboard shortcuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and setting up global keyboard shortcuts... Click with the right mouse button in the player window and select Shortcuts... Select.
You can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as & Amarok; -Shortcuts. by doing so, make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.
The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP features of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.
Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarok has some of its own command line options.
You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kDialog so that the user knows why a script does not work.
Begin require'Korundum 'Rescue Loaderror error =' Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script. '' casdialog --sorry '# {error}' exit end
In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.
With DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.
Most scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop > can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:
& Amarok; send notification to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if it has no use for it.
Configure opens the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok put the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved.
TrackChange signals that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP features, the script could retrieve more information about the new track (for example the metadata or the piece length).
VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.
CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemtile paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu entry can be added. to add a custom entry to the menu, you can use the dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemDetails) to add an item to the menu.
Before & Amarok; ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, to perform cleaning operations. this includes, for example, storing data or configuration settings.
Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).
& Amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the catalogued catamaran script. for this reason, you should designate your script packages right away.
The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:
If your script package is ready, you can place it on www.kde-apps.org and follow the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.
& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.
With & Amarok; you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you're just looking for a very specific title for thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.
You might have some playlists but you can never decide which you want to listen to? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.
Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. these and many other useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to re-experience your music!
Usually, in the base folder of the Amarok sources, you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:
Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you shouldn't have any trouble while compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in & kde; mailing lists.
& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.
For some of the compile options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. see the System Requirements section for details.
Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.
& Amarok; can be set up without difficulty in setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.
In the Player Window, the player window will in addition turn off or off the playlist. if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed.
Use Voting barometer: this function is only available if & Amarok; compiled with moodbar support. the option switches the experimental function of the tuning barometer.
Atmospheric design: this function is only available if & Amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. this will change the used color scheme for the mood barometer.
Store Voting files in music files: this feature is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. if this setting is enabled, .mood files will be stored in & Amarok's settings folder (usually ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodbar /).
External Browser: lets you choose which browser from & Amarok; should be started when a browser is needed.
Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.
When you exit the playlist, the current playlist will automatically save when beaming & Amarok;. enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit.
Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.
To keep up-to-date part of the piece change causes the playlist to roll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area.
When changing to the context browser, the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.
In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.
In the Fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting your own fonts, the otherwise grey represented section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, Player Window and context browser. click Select... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog.
With the Custom color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. for this purpose, use the color selection boxes that are activated for foreground and background color.
Resuming at the start causes & Amarok; after program start the playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop.
Set up the On-Screen display allows you to turn on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can directly view the effect of all settings in this preview.
The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.
Use your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the OSD colors for script and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if own colors use is not activated, the default colors are used.
The Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.
The screen option is intended for Xinama users, which allows you to specify which screen of a multiple monitor environment should appear on the OSD.
The Audio Output tab allows you to select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers still activate further settings in this card.
The card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. it includes the folders and the type of database for the collection.
Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.
Recursively Browse subfolders: this causes & Amarok to browse both the selected and their subfolders according to music.
Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). an incremental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.
Import playlists: causes & Amarok; add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection.
The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field Drivers: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further configuration is required in the MySql subwindow.
The MySql device section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under Calculator: will enter the computer on which the MySql database is located. then under port: the network port under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.
Use Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.
The card card last.fm provides support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transfer the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary.
Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.
Sending played pieces to update the profile: this setting allows you & Amarok; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.
Retrieve similar interprets: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list with similar interprets to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.
& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the features and the gallery with screenshots.
Amarok only needs the package of kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to get e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a little guide on how to compile minimally.
Some functions, such as the OSD, require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of freedoxtop.org, so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will help for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.
Probably one of your files will make an error in the TagLib library. you can locate the file by looking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org and also hang up the broken file that caused the crash.
Mostly this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.
If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a little more mature.
Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but GCC 3.3.X compiled, then this leads to crashes when editing the Meta information.
If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate it automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.
You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open in case of a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.
This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but do not label it as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.

& Amarok; s icons in the Status Bar are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten. you can sometimes click on a symbol in the Control Centre under Appearance icons. note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect.
If you get this error: catamaran app: icon lookup error: amarok app: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixmapERK7QPixmap, then please check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. you can do it with ldd'which amartagapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.
To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the right version first.
There are several possibilities. most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. for this purpose, use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in channel # Amarok.
Bugzilla is not suitable for searching for help. please enter there only one error if you are interested in the correction of an error in Amarok yourself.
After the start of & Amarok; appears only an empty playlist. how do pieces of music come inside there?
This is easy. use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.
To intuitively maintain the interface, the start subwindow has been converted to the statistic window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.
The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.
To evaluate plays, the valuation column must be displayed in the playlist; click on the playlist of the playlist and select column View. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the shortcuts Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.
Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or right click on your selection and then select From the playlist from the drop-down menu.
Drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and drop them there, just as you would do with other files. it's as simple as that: -)
In the toolbar of the playlist, next to the addition button, the button can be saved. click on it.
You probably don't have the xmms-config program. install the xmms-devel package and install & Amarok; new. also look for libvisual, this package contains many very nice visualizations.
The equalizer is located in the context menu (accessible via the right mouse button), and you can also find it through the menu bar under Extras Equalizer....
None. yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, so the real question is What media types does GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you see, we support virtually every imaginable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!
It may! maybe you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with the default setting no MP3 Decor provided (for patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3, input button
Start the YaST Online update and install the 'Multimedia option pack 1'. well... & Amarok; play MP3's: -)
If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).
The output of this command should help you to find the problem item and a solution. for GStreamer, you might need to specify a different sink (e.g. ossesink).
It does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you'd just listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you have a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.
XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.
Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server operated with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!).
With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause distorted playback. read this bug report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.
Either you do not use the Arts Driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).
Use another driver (the xine driver has been greatly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound & Multimedia, Sound System. the smaller the buffer, the fewer supports the visualizations react. yes, this is an error, please help us fix it.
GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; off. why?
After installing GStreamer, you must register all components. perform register stops to register all the GStreamer components.
Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.
Try this (finish Amarok earlier!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all the mpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with you-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start & Amarok;.
If you have a full list of suggestions / requests, please send it to our mailing list: Amarok-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.
& Amarok; is an album by the British Mike Oldfield. I like it very much and find that the name sounds good. besides, the name contains the magic K...:)
Thanks to DCOP this is already possible. in your calendar program, set an alarm and let the alarm carry out this command: dcop Amarok player play
This command lets & Amarok; start playback. make sure that & Amarok; runs before going to bed, then you will have aroused from the soft sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed.
How to find the current in & Amarok; running tracks when one is on another computer?
If there is a functioning SSH environment, you can proceed as follows. this command gives you interpreter and title of the running part: SSH -i ~ / .ssh / id _ rsa ihreip dcop --user yourname Amarok player nowplaying
Replace IP address with your IP and username with your username. this assumes your identification in the file ~ / .ssh / id _ rsa exists.
The visualizations can be separated from the & Amarok; windows. press d on the keyboard and the current Analyzer opens in an independent window in the size.
The combination of Ctrl + right mouse button puts a piece in the queue in the queue. by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist, the first search result will be played and the search returned.
OK, the player window and the playlist have tricky features, but how does it look with the symbol in the Control section of the Control bar?
Click with the & RMBN; on the title of a browser. in the context menu you can select which browser to display.
My Personal Folder $HOME is on a NFS drive. after the start of Amarok, the collection database cannot be created and a lot of error messages appear on the console. what now?
The internal SQLite database of & Amarok; does not work with NFS. either you need ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok to link to a local drive, or use Amaroks MySQL support.
Insert the CD, then click Play Audio CD in the menu. it opens a file browser with multiple folders. for normal reading, switch to the wav folder, select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Konqueror window. instead, instead, take files from the folders mp3 or ogg instead.
QStringList values = query (QString ("SELECT playcounter, createdate, RFROM statistics" WHERE url = '% 1'; ") .arg (escapeString (url)));
Basically, this fits the previous evaluation with a decreasing value based on how often the play has been played. the more often the play has been played, the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result.
You can add the rating for a piece by clicking on a column header in the playlist window. then you can change the valuation of a piece as well as all other attributes, namely by clicking on the item with the right mouse button and Edit: select Review or Edit F2. you can also edit the evaluation in the Metadata dialog.
The developers do not want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amarok. this means: KDE packages have a specified publication plan that is not compatible with the short-term plan of Amarok.
This is a new function in Amarok, which some users can also find annoying. disable the option icon when playing animate in the General Settings.
The Analyzer is part of the tool bar. select Settings toolbar... and take the desired changes there.
Download a design, or create your own. install it under Amarok... Appearance context browser design, click New Design Install....
The icon was too similar to the logo of Warp Graphics Inc. (elfquest.com). to avoid difficulties it was removed.
Konqueror navigation area allows you to monitor and monitor & Amarok; while browsing the Konqueror. start Konqueror and press F9 to view the navigation pane. then click the Settings button (the top) and select "Add amarok."
Audio scanner is a free service sent to information about which pieces are played on an independent server. the service is free and you only need a free username and password.
If you want to use ALSA then please use the latest available version. old ALSA versions have a lot crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports.
Probably, & Amarok; compiled before you have xine or GStreamer installed. therefore, the. / configure routine does not compile these output modules. you need & Amarok; reconfigure and install.
Now I & Amarok; newly installed, but the output modules still don't appear. and now?
You probably need a distribution that will install the development files separated from the actual program. even though GStreamer is installed, you will need to install the GStreamer-devel package. the same goes for xine, you need to install xine-devel. after that you need to recompile and install xine-devel.
I get the error GStreamer-CRITICAL * *: factory for 'Adder' has no type.. How can I fix this?
Your version of GStreamer has been compiled with Prelinking, which is incompatible with GStreamer. you need to compile GStreamer without Prelinking. a tip from merlin-tc: do not use LDFLAGS if you compile Amarok.
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file's mimetype audia / mp4, although the GStreamer faad module is installed.
To play mp4 or m4a files with GStreamer, the GStreamer-quicktime module must be installed next to GStreamer-fac.
You will receive the There is no element present to handle the stream's mimetype audio / mpeg.
You play an MP3 stream, but the GStreamer-mad module is not installed. install the module and then run it as a system administrator. then restart Amarok.
I have a second sound card and use ALSA. how can Amarok use the second sound card?
Set up the device under Settings Amarok... Audio output specify the device. typically, for example hw: 0 for the standard sound card and hw: 1 for the second.
Here is an example of ~ / .asoundrc on a machine with an onboard AC97 codec and a USB audio device:
"" "pcm.intel8x0 {type plug slave.pcm" hw: 0 "" "" ctl.intel8x0 {type hw card 0} pcm.usb-audio {type plug slave.pcm "hw: 1" "" "ctl.usb-audio {type hw card 1}" ""
In xine setup dialog, type usb-audio, and output takes place on the USB sound card. so-lib takes care of conversion of sample rate, channels and so on).
If you want to use a virtual dmix device, disable the check box with sound card supported mmap.
We are sorry, but the audio output with Arts is not going to be taken care of. you can of course enjoy this problem yourself! if you want, you can get the new so urgently needed supervisor for arts:)
Listening to music should be quite simple! for this reason, there is the setup wizard, which is displayed at the first start of & Amarok; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards or simply do not like the wizard, then this quick start guide will help you. with your help you will have set up & Amarok; in a few minutes.
Creating a playlist is very simple. drag and drop items from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field for filtering the collection facilitates you to search for certain pieces. if you are content with the playlist, you can save them with the help of the button playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.
If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have checked the option to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right click on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.
To play an audio CD, select Actions Audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format. simply drag the wav files to the playlist and then press the Play button.
The audio CD function uses the audio cd: / and is not compatible with all available drivers.
The burning function is also available in the playlist. just click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu. you have here various ways to burn a CD.
& Amarok; requires the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. additionally some additional packages are listed that make work with & Amarok; more pleasant.
If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!
& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; a player window with the most important features. in addition, & Amarok; a playlist that is superior to all others.
This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.
The Player Window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display that shows the currently running piece or the current stream. right below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining time of the play.
In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the runtime display. you can switch by the available Analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.
The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.
The PL and EQ buttons also contain the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.
The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the piece position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.
The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio operators. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.
To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.
The & Amarok playlist; is the most advanced playlist of all available for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.
The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right-hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users Powerful enough.
The context-browser features three sub-windows: music, text and artist. these three sub-windows will later be explained in detail.
If you have used earlier versions of & Amarok; perhaps you may notice that the bottom window has dropped off. the information presented here has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok; the information collected in the Statistics window can also be viewed (Extras Statistics).
The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.
The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title there is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to see the piece in the MusicBrainz database.
Below the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.
To show cover images in the context browser, the cover pictures need to be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display covers that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.
The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will play instantaneously.
Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.
You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.
The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. when you click on an album, it will fold and you will see the content of the album.
You can click on all pieces in the single areas to start playing right away. you can also right click on it and then select one of the possibilities to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.
In the Text subwindow, the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok tries to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script runs, you can choose which to start.
The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the changed version will then be saved in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.
The Find button opens a search on google.com according to the lyrics for the running piece (in an external browser window).
Grouping Artist - grouped only the top layer, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.
Grouping Artist / Album - First of all the pieces are sorted according to performer and below it will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various interpreters.
Group Interpret / Year - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.
Group album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the artist is ignored.
Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces will be sorted by genre and among them according to performer.
Grouping genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above but is also sorted by album below the performer.
With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine grouping at will.
With the last button you can change the settings for the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.
There is a search filter directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.
Under the search filter there is a selection box, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose between the last 24 hours up to one year. of course you can also select your entire collection, whereby the filter is switched off practically.
By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options.
Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.
Append to Playlist - Adjust the selected pieces of the current playlist. double click on an entry to get the same effect.
Set pieces in queue - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queue. this will be played next.
Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved.
Transfer to media player - Add tracks to the queue for transfer to the media player. for more details, see the Media Player Browser section.
Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.
Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.
(n) Move files to the garbage bins... - Create a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.
Mark the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among different interpreters.
Highlight compilation-mark - Changes a compilation marked as a compilation album back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be shown in different interpreters but once again with the corresponding artist.
The playlist browser is easy to handle with many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.
The bottom part of the playlist browser includes the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:
Never played: a playlist containing pieces in your collection that have never been played.
Even created smart playlists are possible. click Add Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist, where you can enter all necessary criteria for your new playlist.
The Media Player subwindow is used for connecting & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, it must be included before starting & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.
To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired tracks from the playlist and drop them onto the performer list. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, finish & Amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.
Under the toolbar there is a search area that allows you to search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all the files that do not match your search criteria.
In the lower part of the file browser, there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. for example, if you want to type tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can click music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.
When the playlist is longer than in the window space, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping. in that case, holding down the Shift key may be helpful: this automatically inserts dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.
You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location and drop. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. in order to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.
When you enter delimited search terms, & Amarok will search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.
If you enter the search terms OR, search for entries containing either the one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example all pieces contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).
If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then switch the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will look for entries containing Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.
If you specify a specific search column, you can search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: > 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher score than 50.
If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term, set a minus sign before the search term: -some search for pieces that do not contain something.
You can combine these syntax variants with each other at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR scores: > 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher score than 50 and do not include the commentary bathroom.
You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then click the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.
The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. at the left-hand side, you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist.
The next step is to undo and restore buttons, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.
In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, increased analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.
The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you get displayed in the Player window over the right mouse button. above this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.
There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example playback control and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on Menu and Setting Up Toolbars.
The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval, a slider for the playing position and the play time of the current piece is displayed. the status for random mode and retrieval can be changed simply by double clicking on the respective display area with the mouse.
You can also disable the status bar. you can disable the Status Bar option in the General Settings dialog.
The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. from this menu you can access the settings of & Amarok.
A click on this entry will open the visualization plugin window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.
Behind this entry there is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.
The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures. you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.
The cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left.
With the View menu you can choose what should be displayed in the cover management. select from:
After you set a piece to the queue, a number next to the title appears in the playlist. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.
If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.
There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already pre-given (details about setting up these will follow later).
Fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces while playing.
Adds pieces based on load .fm recommendations (previously: audio datagram). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a .fm profile to work this dynamic playlist.
Double-click the desired playlist, drag it to the playlist window, or right-click on you and then select Load. this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one.
The two pre-set modes of Random Mix and Playlist Mix immediately populate your playlist and you can add at least one piece from your collection. the pieces are added to the next piece change, so your playlist is only filled at the end of the first piece.
If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as a starting point.
The new button replenishes the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode. editing Playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings.
With a right click on a dynamic playlist, you have the option to click Edit. then the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist.
Enter any name for the playlist here. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.
If this setting is not active, your playlist will continue to grow, the setting for upcoming pieces will be skipped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist. however, if the setting is active, the already played pieces will be removed in consideration of the settings.
Played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be stored at the beginning of the playlist. this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently.
This is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece. if you set more than 1 here, the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed each time.
The right-hand settings have been described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you tick more than one playlist, & Amarok will add random pieces from each of the playlists you have selected.
Some scripts allow your own settings. you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Configuration.
You can install new & Amarok; scripts by clicking on the script. a select dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation. after you have installed the script, a new entry will appear in the list. you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet.
If you don't want to use a script any longer, you can delete it. select the script to delete and then click Uninstall.
If you are looking for information to write your own scripts, please refer to the writing of scripts.
The visualization plugin dialog box is used to enable the available visualizations in & Amarok; the window contains a list of all available plugins. to use a plugin, simply activate the check box next to the name.
This Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with & k3b; in four steps you need to create an audio CD. to track the steps you need to have an executable installation of & k3b; and have a folder with audio files.
This is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD.
If you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other lossy compressed formats, remember that you will get a poorer quality when encoding to MP3, no matter how high the bitrate is. you can check if an audio CD has been created by a lossy format.
In this dialog you can do nothing. please wait until the computer has completed the burning process.
This Quick Start is to show you how to copy with & k3b; a data CD in just four steps. to track the steps, you must have an executable installation of & k3b; and have inserted the source CD into the CD-Rom drive.

Mad: this is a high-quality MPEG Audio decoder. it currently supports MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG 2.5. all three audio layers Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III (e.g. MP3) are fully supported. this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module.
Lame: a well developed MP3 Decoder, which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial encoder. lame is used by the MP3 encoder module.
FLAC: a free open source codec for lossless audio compression and decompression. it is used by the FLAC decoder module and the external audio encoder module, so you can read and write FLAC files.
Libsndfile, ffmpeg, FLAC, Musepack Decoder: additional libraries for processing various audio formats. with ffmpeg, for example, it is possible to decrypt WMA files and then burn them to an audio CD. deco
SOX: a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats. SOX is used by the SOX Audio Encoder module.
Trancode: a command line program for video editing. you need it if you want to read a DVD.
VCDIlean: a fully featured authoring system for editing, disassembling and analysing video CDs and Super Video CDs.
Unserialize: this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage. for example, this can be useful for creating mixed CD's and Mp3 collections; without normalising, the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the irresistible effect that the music pieces are played differently.
EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD.
This is a convenient method of re-loading recently opened projects. the associated sub-menu contains a list of these projects. one click on an entry will open the project.
Save the current project. if the project has already been saved, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new filename.
Save the current project under a new filename. KDE's dialog Save As is displayed, with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file.
Stores all opened projects. this is the same as if you would call saving for each project file.
Closes the current project. if a project has been modified and not yet saved, ask and k3b; after what is to happen. you can then switch between save and change. furthermore, you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open.
& k3b; will ask for any non-saved project what to do with it, just as if you had called for each project file close.
Closes all opened projects and ends & k3b; for any non-saved project, you will be asked what to do with it, as if you had called closing.
When you visit this entry, you can select files for adding to the project via the appearing dialog. this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view to the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD.
This dialog is basically the same as the project's Properties dialog. the only difference is the additional Burn button, the & k3b; for burning the medium. the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data.
Open the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described via the What is the right mouse button (accessible via the right mouse button).
This entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b; files from a previous session to import into the current project. this is useful when you merge files for a multi-session CD. the data from the previous session are always included, even if this function is not used. it is rather intended for you to view the files and folders that already exist on the medium.
This entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.
This also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.
This allows even without a project file to copy a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a DVD, which you can then burn sometime later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. furthermore, the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in its original form.
Opens the dialog for deleting a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.
Opens the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), which will delete the content completely. & k3b; lets you choose between the writing modes overwrite and incremental.
The dialog prompts you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, but you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)
Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog prompts you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.
This dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used as standalone. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even ways to change the size and cut black edges.
Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the content view and includes features of the medium, such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD.
Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is selected, the tool bar is currently visible in the main window.
If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.
The folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info, locking and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.
The Content View allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view.
The headline is a narrow area that is visible only when the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.
This opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for & k3b;. after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key mapping for this further down.
This starts the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this you need system administrator privileges, so you must enter the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.
Opens the settings of & k3b; here you can set general program settings. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended for personalisation and fine adjustment of the program.
& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.
To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task are crucial, which of the programs you prefer.
In this chapter, we assume you are using the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following at the console:
Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program in common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.
The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.
DCOPRef createDataCDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void copycat () void burncdimage () void burncdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)
As a result of such a createXXXProject method one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.
K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):
Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, Qstring parent) void addUrl (KURL:: list urls, QString parent) void rename Item (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString)
This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:
#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT scan url / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar
& Audio Creator; is an audio CD; -readout for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.
& Audio Creator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data into WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders who code these wav files (compression). currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (These coding packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).
First the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then
In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed to mp3 or OGG format or to other formats such as the lossless FLAC.
For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudio Creator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.
For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself.
Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher coding gives a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.
A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audio Creator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; it is not possible to read a protected audio CD; read it. in any case, & Audio Creator; even don't avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. just avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!
While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling to read a & CD; on the hard drive explains. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble across at the beginning.
Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)
CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, everything is recorded manually.
This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the page step by step, for example, you will find more information on how to use this program, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.
Starts the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)
Start reading and - when a encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - encoding.
Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default. it should be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.
Opens the file manager so that an already loaded file is selected to code instead of a full & CD; read and code.
Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, pepsen) for program events (such as reading the & CD; quit).
Opens the main setup dialog of & Audio Creator; with different card cards (like encoder, for setting the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!
This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.
If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also others like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. drawbacks are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.
Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important since both encoders generate very good audio quality.
O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless provided with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues
+ High to very high sound quality (high bit rates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG.
OGG - if only music is to be listened to from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playdevices exist.
MP3 - when music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.
A short list of audio quality parameters and computed compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):
'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems.
'--preset extreme '= 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression ratio to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex pieces of music and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.
'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems.
'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate app. 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autoosteroners. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.
'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the highest quality regardless of file size, then select this setting.
The & CD; information that is manually typed or fetched from the freedb over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & Audio Creator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names and the properties of the music files.
In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding agents explain the switches for these programs.
For example, to add the title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudio creator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.
This is a summary of & Audio Creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in assistant):
This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that information can be downloaded instead of entering the computer. it should be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.
Yes, it should be legal, but I (meaning the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information released on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be harmed. all information can be obtained by a CD; business, physical or virtual.
In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address than the data set in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when calling the data from the server (this can only be known by the programmer who checked the code.)
There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographical location on the next mirroring server should be needed. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.
A visit to freedb.org supplies a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD;. alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.
Which reader program is used to store pieces from CD; in WAV files on my computer?
There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; anyone who wants to know more about it in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not yet happened.
For saving the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the Configuration tab. other encoders can be added on this tab.
The encoders package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question, before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined encoders. further information on the encoders is found in the chapter on which encoders are found.
After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).
This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read genuine on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.
Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!
There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.
Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.
In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1.
Both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.
Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write privileges on it (eg; by trying to copy something into the konqueror).
The first section deals with the basic setup of & Audio Creator; something that will probably just be done once and
The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.
Here we determine the encoders to use for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = > VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program using freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.
Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change them every time you read a CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.
The device name will be passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces.
Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive exists, the effective device name can also be specified. if the drive can be accessed with other programs, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing records of the device names for CD-ROM and / or DVD drives will help.
The map map General settings. there is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left as left / typed as shown in the screenshot.
Only if you have incomplete information, you will be informed when information on the creation of keywords (tags) is missing.
The card card CD; -settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freedb computer.
Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.
The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately after reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you later are dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filenames or tag entries resulting from it. the directory and file name is changed with Konqueror > rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & node; tagger.
Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, deselect the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one.
CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.
Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.
CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror-server in your vicinity. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as first attempt.
Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls plot the protocol 8880 by default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.
In this example, we don't want to send a CD; send data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.
Just take over the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)
Number of simultaneous tunes: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so simply try it yourself.
CD; discard after reading the last piece: tick this to the & CD; throw it out at the end of the process.
Custom folders for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must the path / folder be specified where the WAV files are stored. this can be useful if only space is available on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.
Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be smoothed to the right in order to see everything.
'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is on average approximately 224-256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.
Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and output file (including the complete path).
Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:
Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be attempted to code more than one WAV file at the same time.
That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudio Creator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; used. if you have cleverly chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.
This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will create and setup MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, has been described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is built since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD.
Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data obtained from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of extracting them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.
Try not to find the & CD; this example. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.
If this has not yet happened, then the & CD has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.
After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.
If this is not done, look for help in the FAQ section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.
Attention: if the & CD; successfully obtained from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.
In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry that best suits your opinion on your & CD; fits.
If you do not have selected the check box for automatic freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need to connect to the Internet.
E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.
The artist no longer has to be entered in the edit field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.
The comment field below can be used individually for each comment, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.
Attention: after successfully retrieving the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names, but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.
Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & audio creator; maximum allowed.
You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.
Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. please refer to the encoder for more information.
Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD. in this example, this is not important as we do not send the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to find under Rock.
After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.
The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.
Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database.
It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list.
Note that there is a check mark before each row of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.
When selecting the selection process by clicking on the Select button, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what's going on.
Click on the tab Contract to switch to the order pane. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.
This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.
You can see this error when trying to work with a coder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.
By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and the destination folder?; -)
Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.
Assignment 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment # 4 is the encoding of item 1 into the format MP3. thus, reading and coding are parallel. notice the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.
The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in the case of low-performance machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of course, two different pieces).
Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time appears in the top left part of the window.
For the successful use of & kaudio Creator, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you will need the encoder of your choice.
If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions already contain a pre-compiled package, as & kaudio creator; a part of an important package. if you are reading this, you probably already have already done it...
This section is aimed at people compiled from source files and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.
If you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs when it is running, then the following is correct for you:
A program that invokes many different programs has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different tab card settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.
Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue how it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from an unusually short menu?
What is it about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:
A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; thought. whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it. at least after the contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore happy with this suggestion.

Drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window to kmid.
Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (push events or text events).
Session support. if you end & kde; when playing a song, kmid will start again with the same song next time.
Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).
First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can select the desired song.
You can also create a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; this also works with several songs simultaneously.
To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the item play from the menu item or press the space bar.
Please note that & kmid; one piece will automatically start when you drag it to the & kmid; (several pieces will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)
Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving with the slider.
If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the speed display to change the playback speed. to get back to the original tempo, double click the Tempo- LCD.
The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, pressing the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the piece, thus interrupts playback. pressing the space bar while no piece is played starts & kmid; playback.
Lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways. some pieces use text events, others use song writing and others. some pieces do not have any text: -)
In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type will automatically be determined which a song is used, so that you don't have to set anything manually. so if you activate Automatic Textiles in the Settings menu, the karaoke text will automatically be selected. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.
If you want to set an event type, select the items of the items or the push events from the Settings menu. the same function also has keys 1 and 2.
A collection is a list of MIDI files you summarize. these are played back in series. in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently.
To create a collection, open the collection manager first. you will find it in the menu item under the item Organize.... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection.
You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.
If you have more than one collection, you can set the items in the collection manager.
The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.
When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. remember if you add many pieces.
To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it appears again the file dialogue with which you can select the desired song.
A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.
When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).
If automatic addition to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when a piece is opened.
To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.
You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the main menu Remove From the menu collections, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.
If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.
To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.
To skip a song, select the Next Song, next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.
To jump back a song, select the button Previous piece, entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.
To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.
The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving & kmid.
This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.
For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always makes a trumpet sound if you originally play a piano.
If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe and GUS cards, FM-devices and so on).
There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).
A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required submissions for playing a piece.
Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, a prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).
Dean PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of keymap"... END Define keymap "Another keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END
You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.
Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.
In this section you can see how the Patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:
Please note that the left side of the equality label is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.
For example, if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:
So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.
Please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant, in which each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards own).
The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:
As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is their presence. therefore, you have to create 128 entries.
You can define multiple key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.
Keyboards are mainly used to map notes on the percussions channel. see for example the included keyboards.
This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.
However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).
MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:
N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the key map with the name Name for this channel is needed. the corresponding keymap must of course continue to be defined forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will change the patch on that channel. in this case patch x will always be used.
The ForcePatch option can, for example, be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel.
The value for PitchBenderRatio displays, in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.
This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard, which gets a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, should play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.
To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. in the Settings menu, select MIDI Settings.
The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these claviatures you see which sounds are being played straight.
You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob does not flash green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.
The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the Channel view point: settings
The tempo-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.
So if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.
A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can perform very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.
Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 Kb, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.
This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)
I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files separately.
Agreement, therefore supported & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.
Make sure to check the automatic addition to the collection beforehand. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.
You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD.
I have a & kde; -Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just change to the & konqueror; -window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; drag.
If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file becomes added to the temporary collection.
Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so, set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.
Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?
These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue programming.
& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain); I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. at the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time.
If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es
You really make me a pleasure if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list with friends by & kmid; however, before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file already.
I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it. I would like to point out that I just continue to program because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).
Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.
Also thanks to Jose Lus Sanchez for the testing of AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for the testing of AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Corder and anyone who sent me a patch, error notifications or even a supportive email.
And of course, thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.
In addition, & kmid; can also be found on his homepage, which is under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view pictures. you will also find links to pages with further karaoke songs, & etc;
A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends substantially on your sound card. it's not the same whether you are using a FM device or an AWE card.
If you don't have a sound card, compile and compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then works as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear any music.
If you have any problems, please contact one of the email lists or send an error message directly to me.
& SMB; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files from formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD, VCD s or TV and camera.
The documentation for & kappname; was not finished yet as & kde; it was installed on this computer.
For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.
The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always a window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. finally, there is an information window that only appears when information is returned.
It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries played after each other, you should use the category Lastly playlist.
Of course, you can add groups to groups in order to obtain an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the clicked entry.
The categories' current pieces', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, this can only be done if & SMB; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. by clicking on a sub-group, only the XML content of this part is displayed.
After changing XML files, you have to choose the merge mode with the playlist and select either the editing mode, or select another category.
All changes are lost when editing mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist.
As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.
The animation during start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.
It is also possible to activate another animation. & SMB; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml; the format must be a supported XML file.
Animation while starting doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end of the animation, so the user can quit the application a second time.
A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photo: & lt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; In the source package of & KMPlayer; in the source package of & KMPlayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL by & KMPlayer; supported.
There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.
Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of SMB. here is the output of mplayer.
There is no tab for this device in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc, such as setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a flash 'with the swf dec-mozilla module is played:
'Flash 'can be played within & SMB; it can even include the custom field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.
For the & KMPlayer; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Assignments of KDE.
The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. the started process is called crispplayer. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & SMB; (View, Console, or Console from the context menu to check).
In order to always use a given backend for a specific type of mime (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:
& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device must be used and the TV channels must be used. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.
To configure the VDR (Video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in Settings under - > Quelle- > VDR- > XVideo Port should be used. there should be detected ports from which one is selected.
Since the VDR support of SMB can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server needs to be functional. for the XFree86 server, the following should be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)
Internally, SMB uses different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation are dvdnavresources, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrresource. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.
Are there hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?
Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom should be done as user root after mounting the device. it is essential to make sure that / dev / cdrom indicates the CDROM drive.
Xine starts up slowly, why does each time my CPU have to be checked for its performance?
Note: the answer is overhaust. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.

Gopher has originally started as a distributed campus information system from the University of Minnesota. gopher allows the user to access information that is on the web on Gopher servers.
Gopher allows the user to save the position of a desired information in a bookmark (bookmark). thus, the user can get directly to the information with the help of the bookmark without having to browse the entire menu. gopher menus are not standardized so that each Gopher server provides specific information.

QT;: & Qt; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile & dump.
Latex;: a professional typesetting application. under Unix-like systems, it is likely to rely on the package and textual; respectively & tetex; (for older systems).
Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.
The & Kile; project includes some pre-compiled packages of & Kile; for different distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; -page.
This manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.
Advanced users probably hardly need to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact should be made via the box; -page.
If you have any questions or if you wish to compile and / or add extensions, please contact the mailing list box Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.
& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for & kde; - Desktop. & Kile; provides the ability to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, direct and customized access to all & latex; programs. furthermore, offers & Locations; the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex; -Reference and the powerful project management.
To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate;
For & latex; is the right pronunciation: lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, also a layman (lay) & latex; -macros can also be used. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the surname of Leslie La mport.
While here only a good view to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book for it. to be able to rule properly should good offices such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.
The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body starts with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.
The Quickstep Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in & Kile; selecting the wizard (menu) provides some options for creating the document. you can also make some adjustments to the document.
Document classes: this defines the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [report], Article (DIN) [scrartcl], text (DIN) [scrartcl], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [beamer], slides [Prosper] or custom defined.
Encoding: with this the character encoding is set. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be chosen (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).
This list contains the most commonly used auxiliary materials for & latex; it only needs to be selected in the check box for the integration.
Article (DIN), book (DIN), Report (DIN), letter (DIN): the documentation classes of Koma-Script (for compliance with German DIN regulations).
New users don't have to worry about it. it's just a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section.
& Kile; offers - just like other source editors - the highlighting of used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you see more areas of a green text on the screen, it is more likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed. however, it is spared by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it is spared you by highlighting time and money.
With automatic processing of environments, a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & kile; automatically generates a blank line (for input of the text) and the corresponding line to the input of the command (e.g.\\ end {Command}). this function can be set up in the box menu... LaTeX commands are disabled.
All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to the following elements (apart is the most common and the underside element):
In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.
When creating your own & latex; files may be very helpful for backup job. as soon as a DVI; file was created, jumps and kicks; by clicking with the middle mouse button on the DVI; viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.
A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the original output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for various systems and devices.
When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are used with the editor and once clicked to an element in the DVI; file is jumped to the corresponding section in & latex; source code is the exact opposite of it. as soon as on a section in & latex; source code has been clicked, the corresponding area is jumped into the DVI; viewer.
Master Document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set via Project Properties.
Fast construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically (unless there are any errors in the source code).
Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is on the inderungen', and it takes place no call from & eyepiece; after the quick mounting.
When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for fast submission of the document to parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex feedbacks; -commands for subdivision are:
The Other is available for inserting items such as keywords, notes or links. the options available are:
Name: this command creates a term for a section, a picture or a different element.
Cover: used for reference to a specified name (selection above a selection box possible).
When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file becomes a project. for editing & bibtex; files corresponding editors are necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.
The last drop-down selector with the name GrÃ ¶ etune is used for defining the fonts. it can be set the fonts for the main text, the notes notes etc. the following fonts are available:
When calling & kile; two selection options are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from the ground up with the hand.
The parentheses under the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font list is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.
As soon as the above source code is typed, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Build or the Fastening button.
The source code must be saved prior to compile. & Kile; it will automatically dump the source.
If you fail to compile the document, you should look for errors in logging. if you are using a fast construction, eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.
An environment (environment) is a text that is different from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few files should have a different font.\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will allow the change of the fonts inside the environment. "
The changes are only monitored within the environment (by\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restrictions (number) for changes within an environment.
There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat printing, italics, substings etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.
\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italist printing and is valid as long as it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in one sentence can be displayed in italics with\\ emph {word}.
\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {quota}.
After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language was presented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile follows.
As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for better readability of the document. at least one quote, some positions in the bold and short-term pressure and a poem need to be applied to see the differences between these commands.
Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl D can be returned to the editor (with the internal viewer).
Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it out and have fun.
DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I nost). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.
For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).
The tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. as soon as the DVI; file is made from the & latex; source code is created, the conversion can start in desired other formats by means of the buttons in the toolbar.
The preview allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.
& Kile; provides a suitable setting for all & latex; bintings. to do this, just set up modern under Settings Kile... Tools must be selected.
In order to execute the preliminary search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a row of the source code and can be clicked on the basis search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; Viewer takes place then.
With this function in & Eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button on the DVI; -Document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & Locle; opened and jumped to the appropriate line.
If using the Quick Configuration of the & DVI, the viewer is not able to open it, an error can be found. if there is an error, this will be summed up in the logging file or in the message window.
The logging file reads the source code error source. in the editor, the buttons of the LaTeX errors and the latest LaTeX errors can be used for jumps between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, the error in logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the wrong line.
Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:
When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.
Low-cost users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.
To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document...
When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Box... Settings can be set.
When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are to be replaced by which variables:
$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$]
The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be executed:
When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the default ones.
A template can be created from any and latex; files are created. if an easy way to create a template is required, one should search for one on the Internet and follow the steps described below.
& Kate; uses & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).
To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities, the manual must be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate;
& Kile; provides a very practical and latex; instruction reference, which can be accessed via the help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.
Double click with a click of the Ctrl key to select the & tex statement. this means that by clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par is selected.
When dragging the text with the left mouse button pressed, the selected text is copied automatically to the clipboard.
Using the arrow keys with moved shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.
& Kile; has the possibility to search for the most different types of source texts and to emphasize them. for example the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.
Many assistants can include additional jump tokens. these are an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu items Edit Styles or the respective shortcuts allow the jump to the next or last jump brand. thereby, this jump brand is also highlighted, so that it is automatically notified when entering a character.
Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; although & kate; already offers excellent opportunities, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text added. & latex; it always has many environments and groups and therefore supports & boxes; special commands for their selection.
Heals a whole heel (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with plain lines (like in other text editors). this expanded meaning closes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text.
Choose the word below the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command includes & latex; -commands with a back stroke (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.
To delete a part of the document it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Delete the following commands are included for deletion of the text:
Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit select heel.
It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.
This command jumped to the start of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.
This command jumped to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment.
If the cursor is set before or inside the\\ begin {environment} command, jumped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).
When entering many nested environment commands, the overview should be quickly lost. this command only closes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.
& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups that are specified by brackets {...}. in the Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from edit environment.
With this command you jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curving clasp.
With this command you jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curving clasp.
If the cursor is in front or behind the curly clip of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).
When entering many nested group braces, the overview should quickly be lost. this command is the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.
In & latex; two simple instructions are used as the bed. for the suitable implementation is used in & Kile; the sign is used for two simple quotes. also for moving the request the sign "is used. & Kile; knows this case and has two close suits for & latex; one.
This automatic insert of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.
Specific settings (e.g. german or french) and thus German or French suits can also be used. there are also many other languages available.
When pressing Shift; Enter key for & Pack; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), not only a line break, but also the command\\ item.
Within a spreadsheet environment, close & Pack; the current line with\\\\ associated with a subsequent line break.
Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added under Settings Box; Set up... LaTeX can be added.
Some users want to arrange the columns in tables - environments, and all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; try to create this. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; looks & Kile; after the next tab in the underlying row.
Although & kate; already providing a good source code comprehension, it has been added in & Kile; to include special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work on demand and the other two are configured for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings Kile... fully set up.
At the beginning a new environment with the command\\ begin {environment} will be added & box; automatically add the\\ end {environment} command after an empty line (for the text).
When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to dig up the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter.
All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are of course removed when selecting a command. alternatively, attachments can also be found, so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing the jump brand Next part and then the desired parameters can be inserted.
Under Settings Kile; set up... boxes; fully automatic settings can be made to these lists. you can choose different delivery lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as recorders of the general language use.
The command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to begin and the call for the complete set of ambient commands will result. on the other hand, the surroundings are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.
When calling the completion mode above the menu item, or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically added and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient damage can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.
Once this is complete, the environment will be closed automatically. as soon as & Kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.
Under Settings Kile; set up... boxes; fully automatic settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the net list of the complete notification mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.
& Kile; support custom lists of cuts that are immediately replaced by long strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Box... The file example.cwl, for example, is containing L =\\ LaTeX.
For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the menu processing, or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + Alt + ALT, the letter L is replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.
Large consumers are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been established that many more users are written in a document more than once.
This mode can be set up in the box menu... Can be completely deactivated. here, also the threshold for the display of the comprehension can be specified.
The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nlichen Home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.
The dialog displays graphics as simple as possible. for the review of the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be considered and taken into account.
PS files are not as familiar as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is enforced, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript tools and then converted with ps2PDF into a PDF file.
To examine the result of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all building tools are grouped in groups in the menus, compiling, creating and creating views.
For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by keyboard shortcut Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt; 3, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and can be viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.
When using the Quick Configuration command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will be opened each time.
A new project about the Project New Project.... This is where the following information is required for the project:
When filling the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.
The Script function from & Kile; allows for executing ECMAScript code. the scripts can be managed across scripts in the vertical bar.
The API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of & Kile.
First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= box) with the following methods has:
& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; provides a lot of different help to support users.
& tetex; and & texlive; are supplied with many documents. this includes documentation for the packages included and a further & latex; reference.
A complete referness for & tex; and its' freunde. '. it is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a comprehensive operating instructions for the & latex; commands are therefore ideal for searching for specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & Kile; in three important bookmarks.
Because of the quantity of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk that contains a database with all documents and boxes; supplied documents and here for a graphical surface.
All documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or impact filters. from & Kile; only the results are displayed.
Double-clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document.
& Kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; source text editor that can be installed on all systems with installed & kde; working area environment. & Kile; is also part of the Fink project, whereby & Kile; also available on & Mac; with OS X installed.
Many thanks to those who aspire after the continuance of the & kile; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we can all use with regard to the & GNU; license. current information about the contributors is available in the MenÃ ¼ trough & Kile;.

& ksig; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e-mails. with the command line interface you create random signatures or day signatures from a list. this command-line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as & kmail;.
For random signatures, any signature from the signature file of & ksig will be read. by many signatures with different quotes, styles and information, you can make your e-mails varied and unique.
For day signatures the same signature from the signature file of & ksig will be read for the whole day. for each day use it different signatures, as with random signatures create unique e-mails.
To create a new signature, select Ctrl; N file New. this gives you a blank; empty signature; in the Signatures section. click on & lt; blank signatures; and add your new signature in the lower section. signature-example Konqi Konqi @ kde.org Aug. you save your signature, save it with Ctrl; S file or click on the Save Disk icon.
You can create as many signatures as you like. then you have a list of signatures for e-mail programs such as & kmail;. whether you use e-mails privately or professionally, there are always enough signatures.
To delete a signature, select it first and then remove from the File menu or click on the symbol with the red cross removing in the toolbar.
Open the Quick Command dialog. here you can select short commands for menu entries. to change a short command, select an action from the list. then click the user defined button on the right and enter the new shortcut by pressing the button or key combination.
To use & ksig; is & kde; 3.5 needed. to attach signatures to your e-mails, you need a program like & kmail; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command.
All call stack elements are listed here. the older the stack entry is, the lower its frame number. see the example below.
By clicking on a call stack entry in the list shown, the cursor is moved in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file.
& kxsldbg; is a graphical user interface for & xsldbg; which supports cleaning of errors in & XSLT; scripts.
& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;
If the dialog box inspector does not start automatically, select Debuggen Stage manager... in the menu. to edit the entities, select the Entities tab in this dialog.
All external & XML; entities that are inserted over the data file or one of their siblings are listed here. for this example, & kxsldbg; with testdoc.xsl against testdoc.xml (which is located in the directory; KDE PREFIXgt; / share / apps / kxsldbg) to make some entities visible.
Clicking on an entity entry in the displayed list moves the cursor in the main window to the beginning of the corresponding file.
Press the respective button... to select the desired file. please note that the XSL; source code and the XML; data can also contain a URI with http: / /, ftp: / / or file: / /. however, the output file must be a writable local file.
For continuing with the examples, please select the following files in the example folder, KDE PREFIXts; / share / apps / kxsldbg
You can select one or more settings from the Settings dialog. each setting is supported by a help window on the effect.
It is possible to add one or more parameters to the LibXSLT parameter section of the dialog. this allows to pass parameter values to the style sheet.
To apply the changes made, press the button Ok. the pressing of Cancel rejects any changes.
The dialog can be closed by pressing X in the upper right corner of the window. if the settings should be changed, open the dialog again.
Once the style sheet is started, you can select the stage manager in the "Debuggen" menu. then click on the holding points tab, as shown in the example below.
A filename can be an absolute path to a local file. or only the filename (eg; xsldoc.xsl).
A template or model name can be a fully qualified name, although the non-local part is optional, e.g. xsl: mytemplate is also referred to by mytemplate
First click the release point in the list of the current holding points. then press the Remove button.
The status of a specific holding point is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color. the desired color can be selected: see Settings EditorSettings dialog, on the Colors page.
You can set, deactivate or delete a holding point using the buttons, the Debug menu or the icons in the toolbar.
Most of the output from & kxsldbg; will be retrieved and either in the stage manager... Dialogue or in & kxsldbg; output window will be shown. the following exceptions apply to this rule:
The various tools are available through the debugging menu, whereby the stage manager tool is the most important.
By clicking on step-by-step in the menu, a dialog for the selection of the drain speed is displayed.
To stop the process, press the W key or select step-by-step output in the menu.
To consult a system ID in the current & XML; catalog, select System ID... in the menu and enter the value to be searched in the displayed dialog.
To post a PublicID, select PublicID... from the menu and enter the desired value in the dialog shown.
If the inspection dialog does not appear, select Debuggen Stage manager... from the menu. to edit the sources, click the source code in the dialog box.
All & XSLT; source files integrated by the & XSLT; file or their siblings are listed here.
Clicking on a source entry in the displayed list puts the cursor in the main window at the beginning of the corresponding file.
If the inspection dialog does not appear, select Debuggen Stage manager... from the menu. to edit the sources, click the source code in the dialog box.
All found templates are listed here. it should be noted that the export rules of & XSLT; therefore, multiple templates can be present with the same agreement and mode details.
Clicking on a template entry in the displayed list moves the cursor in the main window to the corresponding line of this file.
Local and global variables are shown on a map in the Xsldbg Inspector dialog. the following example shows XSLT source code, where a global and a local variable is declared
Click on a variable from the list to get a summary information in the dialog below. if a variable is a particular expression, for example
In this case, a new XPath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button.
When you click on a variable entry in the list, the text pointer in the main window will be transferred to the corresponding line of this file.
Version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all of these tools use commanas as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as a base. the combination results in fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.
Everyone who has worked with the & kde; documentation knows me and how superior it is. if we lift it one piece, we give it a graphical interface! no longer dependent on a terminal; simply clicked on the icon for the XML processor and finished!
This application expects a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is in the required directory, then let the current job folder be checked. if not, then remove the selection of current job folders and specify the desired folder in the field of other folders.
Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files will be deleted every time myproc is started.
As I said, anyone who has worked at the & kde; documentation already knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; there is now a great graphical interface for that.
If the newly opened file is index.docbook then you just let the current job folder be selected. if not, then select the current folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.
If it comes to an output on the screen, its file is faulty. please check the reported errors and try again.
If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus; then let the current file simply be checked. if not, delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by means of other file - file selection.
If they only want to know if the file well-formed is, click the Well-formed check selection.
To use a & DTD;, which is specified in the & XML; file, select & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the & DTD; with definition URI; file selection. both for the & W3C; & XML; schema and for the RelaxNG validation is the definition of definition URI; in the file selection required.
Yes, & quantaplus; also has a & XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.
Should the file to be processed in & quantaplus; already selected, then let the current file simply selected. if not, remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by the other file file selection.
Enter the name of the file as the result is named, and the file is normally stored in its home folder.
The plug-ins, which & quantaplus; ladet, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. as a result, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the fake in & quantaplus; the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.
To install a plug-in or a KPart, we begin with the Edit plugin menu. this opens the following dialog:
This dialog allows to manage all of the included plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:
Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location, you can use and quantaplus; this path for searching the plug-in.
Often, several people work in a hierarchical relationship with each other in a hierarchical relationship. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.
The name and email are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.
One member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and subproject leaders.
The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and selecting the Setze + button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold as you are: text.
Nicknames and the attitude of one's own identity are important in terms of news and annotations.
In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be an event for informing the team leaders when something specific happens. see for further information.
Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be looked at how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is saved, or a script that takes a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project, etc;
On the site configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.
An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or subproject leader.
Annotations are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:
It can be either the annotation from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by annotation text.
Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role) is a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject Manager The corresponding area or subproject names should be given as shown in the examples below.
Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the clamps and the: make the note invalid.
& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.
The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.
The settings can be set up using the Quanta settings... This dialog extends over some pages that are handled consecutively.
The behavior of & quantaplus; concerning tags including car completion, it can be changed. the entries are:
Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted Tags. normal Groß / lowercase means, the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files.
Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal Groß / lowercase means, the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files.
Automatically close optional tags: if checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional, will be inserted immediately after & gt;
Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.
Update starting and closing tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.
Automatic replacing accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.
MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Default button.
Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is emitted by the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded.
Default DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is emitted from the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded.
Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies so that during a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.
The preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in their own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.
Reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has been messed up by changing the MDI modes and dock / depend on views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameters.
The warning message section is used to control the possibility of issuing warnings by enabling non-polluting requests.
The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronizing behavior of the PL- and the source view in shared mode. with regard to the different modes, see.
Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the mapping of parser nodes in the document, can be set in details.
In the area of the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.
In the Structure Tree Settings pane, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.
The area to set shortcuts (a type of templates), which will unfold when editing to larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifature shortcut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.
Plugins are KPart applications of third party that can be reused by any KPart-capable application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in you have to specify the following:
Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard area like $KDEDIR / lib.
Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.
Load component in "read-only mode" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only read-only parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected.
Check the plug-in: if this is checked, test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.
For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plugins.
Currently, only one plugin is available, supporting the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.
Using the Debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.
If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -UI:
A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. normally appears in the left dock.
A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.
A view showing the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the bottom dock.
Depending on the supported features of the debugger all or part of the following functionality is available.
With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it shares the plugin with listening to debugging needs. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that needs a debugger, so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.
The counterpart to debugger session starts the session. includes connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.
Send an HTTP request to the server for debugging a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to see the current document. the output of this request is shown in the debugger output view.
Instructs the Debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed row. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue.
Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a request is made, the execution starts as soon as a request is requested.
The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.
The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include it is corrected.
Instructs the debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next one as if there is not the current one.
Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.
This dialog can be used to set a variable or set a new value to a variable.
& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdallike as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more Keith works.
This chapter describes how to adapt & quantaplus to your needs and how to help you get better.
Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to provide support for markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS. they enable & quantaplus; your simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.
& DTEP; s are available in two ways, family 1, markup languages and family 2, script languages and & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, file descriptionrc; and TagXML files with extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbol-orientated bars of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.
& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on converting.
This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, a & DTEP;.
TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag shows. the descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool slides allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error.
Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder bear the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)
The table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declare if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them.
The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.
This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains only one element type above itself otherwise nothing.
The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr > an argument of the function. (only family 2)
Valid only for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)
Only valid for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)
If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag. (family 1 only)
Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text > tag. this is a only element type element.
Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.
Prints the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in attribute tree
Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface inside & quantaplus; used to achieve the source data.
Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.
Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tag name%, that means the name of the current tag.
A container tag that brings together the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.
Specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each and every; attr > tag). the element is empty.
Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each and lt; label > tag). this element is empty.
There is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is a single element type.
Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.
All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? > and must be properly chained and closed.
Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip >, & lt; whatsthis >, and & lt; text >.
To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the & quantaplus; window to launch and check TagXML. to select another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.
This function is currently not available yet. currently, the check is done only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.
In the following one example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme > element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.
The following is an example of a functioning family 2 TagXML file. this file describes a & PHP; overload function. the filename of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.
& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? > & lt; tags > & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / > & lt; / tags >
The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Edit DTD settings. this allows diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:
[general] version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.
An action can be set with Settings... created. click New Action to enter the same dialog:
The shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking on the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current key shortcut can be removed.
The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.
This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even include the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.
First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myscript.sh.
Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line such as sh% scriptdir / myscript.sh. this script tries to find: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:
% f: we will replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name will be removed.
% pid: is replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is added unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.
The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.
In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:
Selected text: the selected portion of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.
According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to standard output; error messages, to the standard output output. it can be specified, which should be done with the output specified on the standard output by setting the output field output:
If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.
Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.
The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.
Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.
Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, enable dialog "Edit Tag" when available so that an entry while using the action is possible.
Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulty.
To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will & kiconedit; use. select from the & KMenu;, Diagram Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).
& kiconedit; used default 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit size others.
Please note that the symbol created does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.
With the view that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually seen as loose, stared, further interpreted), or should at least signal a message to the user that clicking this icon will insert; starteg; -Tag in the current document.
After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with settings to set actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.
Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.
Press the button and continue with other tags, so there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.
Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some Trenner in several groups. open the toolbar and set Settings toolbar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.
I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.
For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.
Please note how the Trenner support grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.
The new toolbar has to be tested by using all the symbols to make sure everything works.
Save to the right folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded when a file is opened by the corresponding type.
Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.
Before you start your own documentation, check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has done that for you.
There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you have to create the docrc file. we will leave the first part to you, the second we will treat here.
# KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these functions1 = section1.html section 2 = tag.html tag1 = tag.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag.html tag3 = tag3.html
The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation:
# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference: basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...
Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.
Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).
Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.
The content section is the part of the docrc file to display context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP; script the documentation should be displayed for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by checking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.
A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of PHP;).
Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.
If you are sure that they are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. they won't be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.
With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the disk resources (DTEP packages, tool slides with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:
The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places, there is an Email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool slider toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts tree.
The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. the posts are reviewed and made available only if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is ensured, both for our team and for the future users.
When uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New resource dialog you have to fill out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.
Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), the toolbar can be uploaded, the toolbar menu of files and folders can be started in the template and scripts tree.
After downloading a resource, even before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource due to verification of integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please read the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the source of the resource.
It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format. there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.
The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and conversion of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to use. afterwards, the following dialog will appear:
Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.
! Doctype Definitive line: the string that appears in the! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd
Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.
In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and to be able to fully benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarise oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to familiarize them with these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus.
In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.
Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool slides, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.
Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user in person.
Project related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS, patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which embeds the joint use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project.
The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the tabs with information and toolbars.
You can click the right mouse button to create a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all the tabs, recharge, delete or upload the document, navigate to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.
Right-click in the editor pane will lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tags under the mouse-cursor, help the word under the mouse-cursor or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.
At the top end of the editor window are the tool slides of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of tool slides is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.
The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click on the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.
The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate to and quantaplus; to navigate, open and roam it. in the presentation with tabs stand for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.
Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed.
Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.
Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category hangs from & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only available in the project.
Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script.
This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking an element, the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.
This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the entry system that is aligned to the content allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.
Here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development. you can download pre-packaged documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and considered project-specific documentation.
By default & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.
This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.
This tab displays any error in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.
Die & quantaplus; tool slides are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the chocolate page of the toolbars is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.
Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed tar archive using & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can back up and load them in & quantaplus; like any other!
It is reasonable if you want to customize the site of the & quantaplus; files on your system. therefore, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.
If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & node; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.
& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.
While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible markup language editor would? well, this would make it the absolute greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.
No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. compiled: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; therefore the suitable & IDE; its.
Now, to the above claim, it must be noted that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community. & quantaplus; following, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.
& quantaplus; allows web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.
& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features.
& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.
For more details, see the help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).
& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffine Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.
A quick access list of files you have opened. this list will change each time you open a file that is not on it, where the oldest entry is taken out.
This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.
Converted when pasting from the clipboard there special characters for & HTML; -inscriptions, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.
Converts text from clipboard to & URL; -writing, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.
Enables you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.
Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script outputs error messages!
Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.
Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of the script and the debugger.
Disconnection and switch on the problem report at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.
Shows the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.
When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the input Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.
Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.
Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.
Displays a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.
Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables, for example, to copy video files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.
Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).
Settings like & quantaplus; the project is managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.
Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu when you have assigned them to this project.
A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.
Actions need to be added to a new toolbar. actions need to be set by settings... to add actions. tool slides are saved by toolbars toolbar, or you will be asked if you want to save the tool slides.
Removes a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do that.
This allows you to send your own tool bar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.
Enables uploading of tool slides to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.
Loading a & DTD;, which you or anyone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.
Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTD need to be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist a write permission in the global KDE folder, the store fails.
This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar item is loaded, there is a submenu item in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.
Allows access to the current tag setup dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.
This only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by a tool bar is denied when this day contradicts the rules.
In the plug-ins menu, the available plugins are listed among the menu items mentioned above. click on them. click on an activated plugins to deactivate it.
Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the current version.
Choose the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.
Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; by means of the external application tidy.
Immediate switching between the different user interface types. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes takes time or cause unnice graphics. the card display mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that matches the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.
In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.
Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.
The changes in this dialog affects every application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.
Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you will find details.
A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar, or add them and change sequences.
This should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.
& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.
The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project.
Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when you enter your name, file will be filled in automatically.
This is the name of the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (eg foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.
Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.yourcompan.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.
If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on setting the remote host an adjustment might be necessary.
This is the folder where templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.
This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.
This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.
This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.
Checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be mounted. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook.
With this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selections after google.
This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by dragging or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.
The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be edited in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or modified using the keyboard shortcut Shift; F7.
Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. additional entries are explained below.
A list of file names (placeholders possible) which are re-read from project-related operations such as project folders can be re-read.
Additional options at the top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.
The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.
This way the desired debugger can be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.
Uploading profiles can be set to Upload Profiles (see in), as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing your own tree view for each profile.
In the team configuration section, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.
In the event configuration item configuration, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete actions. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.
By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. currently, this behavior cannot be affected.
To open another project, choose Open Project... from the Project menu or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.
When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before you leave, if & quantaplus; changed files will be found. the same happens when you load a new project.
The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.
Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the context menu called with the right mouse button:
Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.
Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button will be blended to prevent the removal.
The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten on programmers. this option is useful if frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk storage option does not come into question.
This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.
In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:
This is the server's name on which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.
The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & node; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.
The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.
Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time saving function or a danger. use them at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.
A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can give a lot of views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.
Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbar, project toolbar.
This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do the most. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaption of & quantaplus; to your own way of working.
As already mentioned above, tool slides in & quantaplus are best plugged across the toolbar. usage and addition differ. adding tool slides is handled at the bottom of the Adding tool bar section.
The toolbar and the icons can be configured either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar) in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions like toolbar buttons or toolbar buttons can be executed, which leads to the dialog where you can specify which actions to be visible on this or other toolbar.

Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates as basic as an ordinary file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you present to the file system.
Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.
Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url).
Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. typically, more specific documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. it is a simple framework for the purpose and organises work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in template tree among global templates.
This type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment to a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available in template tree among global templates. see for more information on the template tree.
As the name says, these templates are used for whole web sites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure, compiled in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.
Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As template save as a local template....
As soon as this is done, note that (even if it is saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.
Select text in your document and click File As Template Save as a local / project template store. alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the selection to the tree view templates.
The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as dragging and dropping or inserting the file tree from Konqueror.
You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files and create a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, the project folder will be saved, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.
Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can pre-enter headers and footers or dynamically create with & PHP; design, insert files, or link them to them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects.
The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files submitted in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.
To set the behaviour of a folder in the template overview, right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:
A selector with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as elterial attributes are pertinent.
This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder would be set in such a way, it would generally disable pattern in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.
This may be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy content templates to a folder with special headers / footers for a whole presentation already with the appropriate headers / footers.
In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.
& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Source editor that can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode substitutes the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.
The VPL; -Editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.
When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document containing & PHP; contains, a small green icon displays the PHP source code; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to change the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.
The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor, and the cursor in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor is activated synchronously. pressing F9 mode activates the active cursor from one window to another, while keeping the position in the document.
The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code editor can be set via Settings Quanta. after choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the time span can be set. basically, the recommendation: a small gap for fast hosts and a large range for slow speeds.
Suppose you want to change the title of the web page, it is possible to select tools document properties. this allows editing invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor. the document property dialog is also called when a new document is created using the VPL image editor.
Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document, e.g., keywords for Internet search engines. Meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows you to change the content, e.g. key words on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is possible just like with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.
It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.
The cursor is used as in a word processor due to moving with the arrows. in rare circumstances the cursor is behaved like usual. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the back button or the Remove button.
Inserting tags is done in the same way through the tool bar, as in the source editor. it should be noted that inserting tags does not remove existing identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed every other tag that surrounds it.
Some toolbar buttons such as the tables wizard or the Listen-Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; work, in this release, the tables or lists need to be used tool slides.
& xsldbg; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for specific elements is possible and the style sheet version can be followed.
To be able to compile and compile successfully, except & kde, you need libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already present at a typical installation of & kde.
Stop in a template, at a location in a style or xml file loaded by xsldbg or at the current node. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb Compatibility Mode, orphaned fixing points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled.
Xsldbg determines the complete path from a filename without path specification. file names in the same folder as the upmost loaded style sheet filename with relative path to the working folder con xsldbg Is loaded, for example, a style template file.. / en / xsldoc.xsl, the following entry is possible:
In this command, a partial or total agreement with a name named QNAME or a specified mode name will be checked. & eg; template matches with any QNAP property that contains the template template.
Each namespace in the specified "QNAP" will be expanded according to the rules specified in the file namespace defined in the XSL source file. xsl: test1 becomes & eg; extended to http: / / www.w3.org / 199 / XSL / Transform: test1
An inquired break point must be resolved for the associated URI and line number. this is done automatically when loading the first template by xsldbg. holding points are re-checked shortly after the start of each run.

On systems with installed Readline library, you can use the arrow keys to scroll down / down by the expiration of the previously executed commands.
Multiple commands require more than one argument. quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as argument, a holding point is set in a file named "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."
Template _ NAME: a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII characters 0x00 to 0x7F. this name can be a fully qualified name such as "xsl: templateName."
Filename: a valid local filename on the user's system. on Unix or cygout systems, the name may have the prefix "~" as a short form for the personal folder. other environment variables are also allowed on RISC OS systems.
Path: a path to change the working folder. on some operating systems, the prefix "~" will be replaced by the path to your personal folder.
Data: the XML data or the XML _ document that is processed by the style sheet. see also & lt; FILENAMELY; and & lt; URIts;
Runtime commands: {bye _ BAR _ exit _ BAR _ quit}, step, step up, step down, next, continue, run, trace, setoption, options
There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.
The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes while at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.
The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.
This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.
For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.
A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function converted & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.
This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps & kdiff3; when selecting the correct changes each. the merge-editor among differences windows enables resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:
& K diff3; also helps to compare and merge the complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merge-merge:
& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.
Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)
If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.
If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the file name of the first file completely. example:
Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 -o target folder
The opening dialog allows for manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog remembers your selection and displays them next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.
Using the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the matching or merging of folders is started. however, if a file is selected for A, B and C then use a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.
If merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when you save it.
The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the comparisons / merging.
Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog you do not need to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.
You can also drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.
Sometimes a file contains, for example, several similar features. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you'd have to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; download and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.
Note: currently you can't remove anything & # diff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.
Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.
The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line.
The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)
When a difference is detected, one sees the color which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that is good to see in the next section (merging).
When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. when differences in white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare individual cases.)
The vertical line that divides the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is enabled, the line is displayed on broken lines.
The result window (under the comparison window) also has an info line with the title Output:, the filename and [encoder] if you have processed the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.
!!! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to find the next solved / unresolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)
If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually.
By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and a black bar appears on the left.
Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps still select another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and insert elsewhere.
The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.
Note: when selecting the options for ignoring the options or activating Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.
Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, up, down, page descending, Start, End, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you are used by other programs.
In the display window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)
A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).
The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Out / Ctrl-Out) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict. therefore, conflicts between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.
To copy the clipboard mark you have to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is checked, whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted.
Line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binary files.
The options and list of recently used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start. (set up Settings - > KDiff3...)
Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays writings with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)
If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the selected font does not support this display, nothing happens at all.
On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be displayed scastert. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically adjusts an unregulated color.
If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.
If you press Enter or Return, the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.
If this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. copy the manual copy to the clipboard then.
You can select which newline type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.
When comparing files & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when merging, white characters are not ignored.
Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others save only a line feed '\'. usually ignores & kdiff3; the carriage return character is made visible, but like a white mark. during the merge this option must be disabled.
In the first part of the analysis, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.
In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.
Search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.
In the auto-skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict continues.
This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also applies conflict in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments.
These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and merging a merge. check for details under documentation to compare and merge.
If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.
Adapt the interface language. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need & # diff3; exit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)
The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.
Over the selection fields for coding a short note appears, which is the local code. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informational character.)
Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.
If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.
If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec (e.g. your files might be 16-bit unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.
Turn off this to suppress changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignored C / C + + comments.)
This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded oversight column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal or second oversight column with the required information.
Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply Blend the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)
This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)
Sometimes merge the differences and then decide to merge the files. merge the current file together in the merge menu even if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)
When reading a file, it will be passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly matches your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut distracting parts or to correct the indentation.
When reading a file, it will be passed to this external command first. if a normal pre-processing command is also specified (see above), the output of the command is used only for line calibration. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.
The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.
Use this pre-processing command for line calibration to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a granular expression that fits all characters in one line.\\ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first clamp pair. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.
The\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
While you are experimenting with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.
Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessing command for row abouts. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each signal between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.
Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements one from another. example:
Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) is needed, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:
The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line comparison algorithm looks like.
Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line equivalent preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.
The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may inadvertently notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.
Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder.
... make a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,
... simulating the merge and displays the simulated changes without really carrying out them,
... executes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),
This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to open a folder on the command line or in the File dialog.
If three folders are merged, then folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder was specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.
Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (see more details.)
While reading the folder, you will be notified of a small message box about the current progress. if you abort the folders scanning, only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed.
When scanning the folders is finished, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side...
Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.
The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by double-clicking the + / - or by double-clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu provides two functions to open all sub-directories and open all sub-directories with which you can open or fold all the folders.
If you double-click on a file, the comparison window will be started and a comparison window will appear.
The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:
If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the column A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation cannot be automatically selected.
As seen in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black are used.
In the case of identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries varies.
Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.
The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colours of a leaf that is green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.
... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)
... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)
... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)
... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B one file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.
... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B one file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.
The mode to synchronize is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified, and if the option synchronize dirs. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that after that both folders are identical. if for an entry...
... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file name for output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)
When two folders are merged and the option New File instead of merge selected, then examined & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date appears, an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical. Solange does not fix such errors, the merge of the folders cannot be started.
During the merge, one file is processed after the other. it shows the status column when the merge was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.
If the file comparison method is selected fulltime analysis in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the resolved conflicts column will only be shown when three folders are compared or merged.)
You can either merge the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.
Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder merge mode C is used as the target, in the two-folder merge B is chosen as the target and while syncing, A and / or B is used as the target.
If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:
To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to merge only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.
If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid promotion for them.
When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Browse, Simulate and Cancel options.
Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without changing the real changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.
& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window will open (note the screen shot).
When you are finished with a file, select / Continue directory merge, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear.
When & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to avoid the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), let & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge.
If some entries have been merged individually, then & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries. even if the merge action has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.
The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set up Settings - > KDiff3...) now has a section called Directory merge with these options:
Only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. several patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.
Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.
Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.
Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmally generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder specific can be set with a .cvindicated file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)
In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a previous dot indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default setting.
With links to files: when the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled by default.
If the option is turned off, the links like normal folders are treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not checked for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a continuous loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is turned off in default.
Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)
If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the date of change and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security.
Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this can be useful, for example, if the modification date is lost when copying. please use caution. this option is switched off in the default setting.
Enables synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default.
If there are differences, instead of merging, the copy of the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered unsafe, because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified either.
If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merge of individual files, not only the merge of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.
Normally, the folder merge view is visible while merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch the directory & text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and the text window.
You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. as soon as you save the result, the status will be set to Erleashed and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge.
However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read
KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slave. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this allows you to specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts.
The first command line compares a local file to a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.
A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be noted:
A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.
Special characters must be escaped. (# - >% 23, Space >% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.
Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:
Or it cannot be distinguished, whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).
There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (please note the option Trust the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)
The main purpose is currently seen as a Difference Viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press right mouse button above the Difference Viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.
Usually it takes & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is used as a part, & kdiff3; then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.
In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.
When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing files is not supported in Part Mode.
Tools called KDiff and KDiff2 (now you can use pare) already exist. in addition, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff3 program from the Diff Tool collection.
I have been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or who will go this way.
You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.
If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white mark is different, the line is treated as not identical.
The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary in order to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.
You can always restore a specific version by selecting a source (A / B / C). in order to process larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.
After removing text suddenly is lt; no src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?
& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis is confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.
Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!
To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.
Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.
A list of recent changes can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.
To compile and install; to compile and install on a system with & kde, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -distribution:
KDE-dir indicates the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.
Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compiling. if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of it.
Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies to clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Paste) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.
Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.
(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you must re-read the folder with the Update function.)
There are only entries showing differences. this also causes identical files to be copied into the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after the merge operation. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in the default folder.
Note the buttons for selecting the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present).
In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.
The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktops, change their size, finish them or move them. this works both within a desktop and several.
The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in them. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.
With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other desktops.
The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the blank background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has the two entries pager setup... and end. if however on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimise, maximize, work on the desktop and exit.
Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.
Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicking on an application.
If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other desktops.
If this field is enabled, the name of the virtual desktops will be displayed in the & Kpager.
Cross this field allows the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed along with name, the names will be marked with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.
If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the & Kpager;
When this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection.
Here is the view of the program window. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program windows. icon displays the window with its default symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.
Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classic lets & Kpager; appear in a 2xN grid, as known from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row, which is very well suited for viewing at the side of the desktop.
The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be resized in size, displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with their contents.
Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.
Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:
Open the file $KDEHOME / share / kpages.c with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator.
Since & Kpager; part of the package kdebase is, you need a working installation of the basic KDE basic packages.

& kmag; is a screen saver. you can magnify with & kmag; a part of the screen, as if you read a magnifying glass for the print or the exact looking of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation should be a complete manual for use of & kmag.
& KOK; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.
The main window of & kmag; displays the enlarged portion of the screen. the image that appears in the magnifying window is an enlarged portion of the screen and is referred to as a selection box below.
In the default setting, magnifies & cons the area around the mouse cursor as a mobile magnifying glass. alternatively, you can set a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse-pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).
If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the pointer mouse cursor. please note that & kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; -mouse pointer.
In the selection window mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:
Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and keep the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also goes with the arrow keys.
If you additionally press the & Shift key or use the & MMB, you can move the selection window.
This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.
& KOK; has a lot of features. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save to a file, paste it into the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the picture and much more.
Starts or stops the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against zero.
Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.
In this mode, a select window will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in a window.
& KOK; automatically uses your set shortcuts to save files, opening a new window, printing, new ads (with button document again load in & konqueror;), Enlarge and size & etc;.
Kmag is also known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen motion. you can magnifier; you can use an area of the screen to view the plain print in a newspaper or photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visual handicapped.
More detailed user documentation can be found with help: / kmag (enter either this URL in the address bar of & konqueror; one or start khelpcenter help: / kmag).
& kmagnifier; was developed by Olaf Schmidt ojschmidt @ kde.org and Sarang Lakare sarang@ users.sf.net and Michael Forster Forster @ fmi.uni-passau.de.
& kmousetool; emulates one mouse click as soon as the mouse-cursor leaves for a while at the same position. it is designed to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury Syndrome) and which each mouse click creates pain.
& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click once the mouse-cursor continues for a while at the same position. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and that any mouse click pains. moreover, it may emulate the dragging with the mouse. this requires a little practice.
& kmousetool; can handle the pain created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain that is related to your computer's use may also cause pain. if you suffer from pain that is connected to your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.
To clarify again, even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by mouse clicks, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse, and as with all ergonomic aids: the result can be different for everyone.
The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and results in a mouse click once you interrupt the motion.
When the smart move is enabled, & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates pressing the mouse button. move now the mouse, wait until the end of the move, before releasing the mouse button. in this way you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.
This residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool.
If Intelligentes move on, the default shooting time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button waiting, before pressing the mouse button again, if no moving mouse takes place temporarily.
& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function activates, a slow moving moves to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.
When the sound is delayed, you can drag & drop; to shorten the response time, go to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten response times.
When this setting is selected, & kmousetool; launched at every start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; please consult the documentation for GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically.
Reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened. if you already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user.
Best use & kmousetool; first with the Preferences. in particular, the smart move should be switched off at first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart move.
If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.
First of all, you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.
If your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually pretty simple. the trick here is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.
First you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.
If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the wheels. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape off with a flat blade or the fingernail.
In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool, when an imposition has just begun. if you are using the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.
This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.
The solution to this problem is that you are running a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.
Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.
Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. however, you can park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the headlines of windows.
I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't manage to edit text.
The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is quite possible to copy text, copy it to the clipboard and execute any other action you wish to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.
Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool. instead, mark the text at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while moving the cursor to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again.
Use the audible mouse-click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shifting time starts when the intelligent shift starts. later, you can also use the intelligent push-button without the portable mouse click. but this requires some practice.
To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; it should be installed on most systems.
The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and is correctly set up.
& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer closes. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and which causes pain in the mouth.
& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag action to start before releasing the mouse button. in this way, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed.
More detailed user documentation can be found with help: / kmousetool (enter either this & URL; in the address bar of & konqueror; one or start khelpcenter help: / kmousetool).
& kmousetool; developed by Gunnar Schmi Dt Gunnar @ schmi-dt.de, Olaf Schmidt ojschmidt @ kde.org and Jeff Roush Jeff @ mousetol.com.
& kmouth; is a program with which dumb users can let their computer speak for themselves.
With the program & mouth, silent users can let the computer speak for themselves. the user can choose from a list of the conversation history sets which are to be spoken again.
On the first page of the wizard (left screen shot) enter the command that is later used for the speech output of text. for more details, refer to the description of the setup dialog.
On the second page, select the default text passages. from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without having to type them. the text passages can of course be edited.
On the third page (right screenshot) you determine the dictionary for word completion. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word. in addition, you can synchronize the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary, so that only correctly spelled words are included in the word trance.
The main window of & kmouth; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a course memory of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).
If you have arrived correctly, you can enter the sentences in the input field, which you want to hear. each spoken phrase is attached to the expiration system. you can select sets which are to be spoken again.
With the menu entry settings kmouth; set up... open the settings dialog from & kmouth; This dialog contains two box maps, voice output and settings, the Page Wortergänger and the KTTSD language service page.
In the input field of the box card speech output, enter the command to call the voice generator. in the field of the box below the input field, specify the character encoding that the text will be passed on to the voice generator.
& mouth; knows two ways to pass the text on. select the check box if the text should be passed on as standard input to the language generator.
If the check box is not selected, the text will be passed as a parameter. you can use the following placeholders:
Of course, the command for voice output depends on your voice generator. you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator. examples for this can be found in the appendix.
When this is successful, the other settings on this page will be ignored. the kttsd voice service is a & node, the & kde; -applications a standardized interface for voice output which is currently being developed in the SVN. the choice of this option is useful even if KTTSD is not installed.
With the first selection box action after selecting a text passage, you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard shortcut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage menu or in the bar for text passages.
With the option of Immediately speaking, the selected text passage will be spoken directly and additionally inserted into the expiration buffer. with the selection of In the input field, the selected text passage is first entered only into the input field.
The second selection field Close the editing window for text passages, you can specify whether the text transcript should be saved automatically when you close the editing window.
The book stores the book with the selection of text passages. if you choose to reject changes, the text passages are not saved. select before saving, will & kmouth; ask if the text transcript should be saved.
The Wortergänger Page contains a list of dictionaries for word transcription. in the main window next to the input field shows & kmouth; a selection box, if this list contains more than one dictionary. with this selection box you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion.
With the buttons on the right side of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them to a file. below the list you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field.
Select the language you want for this source; & kmouth; then read & kde; -Documentation. the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the word list with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary.
With this option, you can merge the available dictionaries. & kmouth; then ask which dictionaries are merged, and how they should be weighted.
With this option, you create a new, empty dictionary without entries. da & kmouth; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary, create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time.
The main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two. in the upper part, the text passages are displayed as tree structure.
In the lower part, you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the corresponding shortcut. if you have selected a text passage, you can only change its name.
Add actions like new text passages or books, or delete selected text passages and books, either by selecting the menu bar, toolbar, or a drop-down menu.
The order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dragging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the & Alt; button.
The selected text is cut out and copied to the clipboard. if a text section is selected in the input field, it will be used, otherwise the selected area of the expiration storage.
The selected text is copied to the clipboard. if a text section is selected in the input field, it will be used, otherwise the selected area of the expiration storage.
The currently active set is spoken. if text is in the input field, it is used, otherwise the selected propositions of the expiration memory.
If this menu entry is crossed, a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed. the toolbar can be moved by default over the editing window directly under the menu bar. by clicking on the shaded left side and dragging the tool bar can be moved to another position.
If this menu entry is enabled, a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom of the main window with clues about the state of & kmouth; if not checked, this status bar is hidden.
If this menu entry is enabled, a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed. by default, the bar is placed directly below the toolbar by default. by clicking on the shaded left side and dragging the toolbar can be moved to another position.
You probably haven't entered the command for voice output properly or not completely. open settings kmouth; set up..., open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the card voice output. (see Settings dialog for voice synthesizers for more details.)
Festival is a voice-overs system from the University of Edinburgh. currently only English, Spanish and Welsh are supported. the license allows you to use the Festival free of charge and to further distribute it without any restrictions.
To show an example of the command line for setting the voice output, it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory.
FreeTTS is an in & Java; written voice generator. currently, it supports only the English pronunciation. the license allows to use FreeTTS free of charge without further disseminating restrictions.
To show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output, it is assumed that FreeTTS is installed in the / usr / local / freett directory. the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands:
For the third example, the option must be switched on as default input. (this is the recommended example of using FreeTTS.)
MBROLA is a language generator for many languages. it converts a list of phonemes into a Wavedatei, so you need an additional program to dismantle the text in phonemes. the license allows you to use MBROLA for free for non-commercial and non-commercial applications.
In our example, Hadifax is used to convert the German text into phonemes for MBROLA, assuming that Hadifax and MBROLA are installed in / usr / local / hadifax and / usr / local / MBROLA.
Unfortunately, Hadifax would like to swallow the last character of the text, so that an additional character has to be added. therefore, the complete command is more complex than in the other examples:
(cat -; echo & quot;) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadifax / txt2pho -f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MBROLA / de1 - / tmp / tmp.wav; artsplay / tmp / tmp.wav; rm / tmp / tmp.wav
All parts of the command must be written in one line. the option to send data as default input must be switched on.
The voice-out demon of & kde; (KTTSD) is a language service that provides all & kde; applications a standard interface for voice output. KTTSD is currently being developed in the SVN. it uses modules to support different voice output systems.
Since the voice generator setting only takes place in the KTTSD, you only have to use a tstsd as a language service in & kmouth; set.
To setup, use the KTTSD language service page, which appears in the settings dialog from & kmouth; appears when KTTSD is installed.
To use it successfully, you need a language generator (and of course & kde; 3.x). & kmouth; requires about 15 MB of memory (and additionally memory for the language generator), but it depends on your computer and its configuration.
& kmouth; is an application, with the people who cannot speak, can send text by the computer. it is stored in a list of already spoken sentences that the user can always recharge.
Note that & kmouth; does not include voice synthesizers. a voice synthesizer must be installed on the computer.
More detailed user documentation can be found with help: / kmouth (enter either this URL in the address bar of & konqueror; one or start khelpcenter help: / kmouth).
& ktert; - the & kde voice output system; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the & dbus; interface.
& ktert; is a sub-system in & kde; for voice output (TTS). it provides a common application interface for & kde; -programmers with which their applications can be equipped with TTS capabilities.
Reading texts (or parts of it) in the text editor & kate; even if & kate; embedded in other & kde; applications.
Speech output is provided by the speech-scheduler program, which uses various background programs such as espeak, festival, & etc.
Allows the creation of language editions on the command line (or with shell scripts) via the & qdbus; -aid program.
In ZUKUNFT: support for Speech markup languages like VoiceXML, Sable, & Java; Speech Markup Language (JSML), and Speech markup meta language (SMML).
The & node voice output service; an application without visible windows that offers TTS services over & dbus;
An application with & GUI; to configure and set a ttsd over ttsmgr in the system section.
A web browser & konqueror module; for reading the texts from a web page or sharing it.
A text editor module with which a text file can be read in whole or in part.
In addition to the bugzilla database of & kde; (http: / / bugs.kde.org /) you can find the list via https: / / mail.kde.org / mailman / listinfo / kde-accessible. you can also find the developers at IRC (irc.kde.org, channel # kde-trol).
Before you can use it, you need to install and set up speech applications.
On the first start of ttsmgr or as long as no actors are set up, the card card is shown. see also. if you have at least one speaker, the card board will be displayed in general.
Most TTS synthesizers offer different languages and voices, so also various male or female, or those that differ in volume or speed. you can also set up several variants for a synthesizer. you should at least set up a speaker before you & tts; otherwise the program speed-dispatcher uses the default speaker.
Different speakers for the same synthesizer are comparable to several printer queues for the same printer.
If you click on the card reader in ttsmgr the card card will be displayed. this will also appear automatically when you start ttsmgr and no speaker is set up yet.
All speakers already set up appear in this list. the preferred speakers appear at the top of the list. the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker for any application.
Select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list.
Select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to change the settings. see below.
With a click of the mouse, select a speaker from the list, and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down. the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority.
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running & desktop.
Select here a type of voice, three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls' voice are available.
When you click here, the new speaker will appear on the tab Spokesman. to change the settings of this speaker, click Edit.
Now you can use & ktts; already almost. go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled (KTTSD) to start the TTS service from & kde. see. now you can use & ktts; use to create and manage text jobs.
If you have at least one speaker, you can start the language selection system from & kde; click on the General tab card to open this card. here you can set some general options.
Select this check box to activate the tracts; this starts the KDE-TTS service (KTTSD). if this start is successful, the box card orders are displayed, and you can create text jobs and read them. see. remove the mark, KTTSD is stopped and the TTS system from & kde; disabled.
When ttsmgr is finished, it is running and running; further, if the Voice Output field is enabled (KTTSD).
If this check box is marked and ttsmgr appears automatically in the Control Panel at the previous read, it will disappear again as soon as the reading is finished.
With the buttons in this row you can start, stop, pause and resume text jobs.
With the buttons in this row, you can read the current text in the & kde; -Clipboard or open a text file to read. you can also change the speaker for an order.
Click Apply or OK, then all changed settings will be applied to all pages.
The card orders will only be shown when the KTTSD is started. to start KTTSD, click on the General tab and tick Voice Output (KTTSD).
In & konqueror;, the web browser by & kde, you can read the text of the displayed web page. first, check the text that is to be read and select the text from the main menu. after a short time, the voice output should begin.
It is almost always useful to mark the desired text on a web page. you can also skip this step, but then many & HTML; headers and other invisible brands will also be read.
In & kate; the enhanced text editor of & kde, you can read the text displayed. first, check if & ktts; then check the text to read, and select the text editor in the main menu. then the voice output should begin.
This also works when & kate; embedded in other applications, such as & eg; in & konqueror; or in & Quanta;.
Knotifying is the & kde news system that notifies you of events you have set. you can read the text of these messages from & ktts.
In & conversational;, the IRC program of & kde, you can set up various types of messages. you can set up & conversation; for example, set up a message when a message pops up in an IRC channel where your nickname occurs. with & ktts, you can then read the IRC message text.
Supports a & node program Knotify, a menu entry will appear in the menu Settings menu of this program. the possible settings for Knotifications differ depending on the application.
The kmail.xml file, which is part of the delivery of & ktts, is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by KMail, and also the expression / local / inbox, as this can be assumed in most cases as presupposed.
Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of fractts; filters are not required for normal work.
In filters text is processed before being sent to the speech speech scheduler. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to replace unspoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker, or to bypass certain deficiencies of speech synthesizers and their voices.
"" "to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the" "" "speech Dispatcher" "" "program works with a text." ""
The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs. if the output of the screen reader is read forward, the retained orders are resumed.
Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is subject to heat. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the output of the warning.
News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; having a long text read on a web page, you can greet with & kmouth; someone who is just entering the room. & kde; notifications are also news.
The rest are simple text orders. every order that you send from the card order is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text jobs. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular urgency.
All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one reads this, this output is stopped and stopped.
First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.
Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.
Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be even more types of filters.
String replacement parts replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with predefined string replacement filters, which allow replacing chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for re-formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.
& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery, are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; in SSML.
With subscriber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; send to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card reader, you can read text from KDE messages about it.
Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is used for voice output. if the filter determines that its rules are not true, the text will remain unchanged to the next filter.
When a text order, a message, a warning or a & kde; -Notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below. editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.
This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.
Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the next screen dialogs will be displayed.
For setting string replacement filters, you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.
Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.
This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the list. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.
Click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list.
With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.
If a language is registered here, the filter is used only if the spokesman speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click the button to see a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages by holding down the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.
If a value is entered here, the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail
You get the application ID of running programs with the program qibus;. the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example & qibus; the application ID copy-3432, you may only enter copied.
The string replacement filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box can apply these filters if match. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.
When comparing these words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s\\ s\\ s. thus, the words must be limited on both sides by a separator.
In this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular expressions can be found in the package.
XML; converters translate & XML; with the help of XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility needs to be installed on your system.
Enter the path for the xsltproc User Language program. if xsltproc is reachable using the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is sufficient.
With the subscriber selection filter you can send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card card speaker, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can set the text to be read from a female voice by kmail.
Before & ktts; a text passes to the filters, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program presenters, which sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board.
If a value is entered here, the filter will apply if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of the & node; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can access it with a click on the button to get help when entering.
To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression <! [CDATA [^]] >.
Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements. click the button on the right to view the speaker selection dialog.
Use these buttons to save or load your speakers settings or delete all settings.
The Speaker Selection Filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Diesen Filters if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.
The Voice Output API, by & kde; with the help of programmers can give their applications TTS skills. applications communicate with KTTSD about & dbus;.
The KTTSD module API, with the voice synthesizer to be added to KTTSD, so you can use this synthesizer.
The following section contains a short description of the & kde; -DBus; -Interface of the language output API from & kde;. the full documentation for both APIs can be found on the node; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).
Applications call for voice output services via & dbus; -Interface of & kde; from the fractd program to the object KSpeech.
Text of the text to read and option is a language code like & eg; en, de & etc;
There are more commands that you can use. for a list of all commands, enter
Open two & Console; -windows. start now in a window, then ttsmgr in the other.
None of the mentioned language synthesizers supports my speech. where can I get a synthesizer for my language?
I have set up the & HTML; -XML; -Forming filter but when using the module for the festival web pages are not read.
Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone to make Sable at all. you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages. furthermore, make sure the xsltproc User Language program is installed and the environment variable PATH can be found.
Certain characters or punctuation marks appear to cause errors in the synthesizer, so that whole sets are skipped or only gibberish. what can I do about it?
First of all, make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct language value. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be fixed by a string replacement filter.

The voice synthesizers used by & ktts, have their own license, which you will find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites. there are also voices that own your own license.
If you have access to the KDE source code archive, you can download the package declinwith & ktts; download it. & ktts; find the source code of kdebugging ftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / kde /.
Contains many languages, a list of all currently supported languages on the project page http: / / espeaci.sourceforge.net / languages.html.
American English, British, Spanish, German, Finnish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Italian, French, Canadian French, Kiswahili, Zulu and Ibibio.
KTTS cooperates with any voice synthesizer that can be started on the command line in a & console.
The list of languages listed above can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the Synthesizers to the supported languages. also check the website of ktert;, for information not yet contained in this manual.
The "speech Dispatcher" program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand and tort; for the use of any other synthesizer, contact the developer team.
The xsltproc User Language program is used to support SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.
To compile and install, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including the kdelibs and the development files for the 'speech Dispatcher' program.
If you have downloaded and downloaded the source code from & ktts, from the source archive for dictions or downloaded tarball each night, and install the program using the following commands:
Before using a speech synthesizer, first check if speech synthesizer works properly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf.
& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of speech. the tmsg program should be developed so that the creation of speech dispatchers is directly possible and the script spld-conf is no longer required.
A long text is broken down into individual sentences. the user can return set or paragraph style, repeat, pause or cancel output.
If an application is text on & tts, you can specify the characteristics of the preferred language speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker is selected. if you want to know more about how & tts; select a speaker, you will see in.
When you click Add to Add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card reader device will appear. as an example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, see below.
Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is contained in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.
Select the character encoding for text passed to the festival. in the case of voices, the & ktts, this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.
These sliders enable you to adjust volume, speech speed, and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a number of sliders and display them grey, the voice you select does not allow these settings to be selected.
Some voices like multi-syn voices need to be charged for several seconds due to their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first movement is synthesized faster.
If this check box cannot be selected, you have not set up a speaker (or click Apply.).
If this check box is selected, a ttsmgr displays the program window at the start of ttsmgr. apart from that, only the icon in the system section is visible after the start, but not the program window. click on the system section icon to see the program window.
If this check box is marked and ttsmgr does not work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.
Here all orders in the queue are listed, along with the application that has set the job, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently processed sentence. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker.
With buttons in this row, you can go forward or backward on the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every job consists of several sets).
With a click on the OK button all changes in the settings (also on the other card cards) are taken over and ttsmgr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window again.
If the sound system & arts; not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click on the Audio card audio.
Here, only text orders are listed and managed. issues of screen readers, warnings and messages are not displayed. for more information about the types of messages, please refer to.
Select the type of audio output. if a component cannot be selected, & ktts; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or ktypts; can not load the necessary libraries.
If you want to use GStreamer or aKode for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.
Make the speaking speed here. 50 nbsp;% equals about half and 200,1% about the double normal speaking speed. so that these settings can be implemented, the program must be sox installed.
Click Apply to apply the new settings for the running & desktop.
The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system. most of them will not work. you have to find out which device works with you. in doubt, choose Standard.
On this card you can set up special actions which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority.
The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of the screen reader has been read, the orders received will be resumed.
Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is subject to heat. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.
News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you & eg; just have a long text read on a web page, you can talk to & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room.
If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, the audio output is stored in the queue.
This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. when both sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.
The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings, and spending of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message.
To read with & fracts; to read the Knotifications messages, start ttsmgr and click notifications. the box notifications will appear.
Select this check box to switch to & kde; notifications. if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are disabled and ktts; do not read alerts.
If this setting is selected, notifications in which a sound is played will not be read from & forth.
Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. when you click on the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.
This event reads the message, the & conversation; sent when someone mentioned your nickname in an IRC message.
All events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by & ktts; ignored.
Use this drop-down selector to specify what & tts you want to do when an event occurs. you have the following choices:
If you have selected Custom Text, enter the text you want. you can use the following placeholders:
You can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want. standard selects the speaker, which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the card card. see also.
Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is set for a certain event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application.
The All notifications for the Standard application (any other event cannot be deleted from the list. you can set up the default notifications as follows:
Use the Save button to save the settings for the notifications to a file. use the Load button to load saved settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except all notifications will be deleted.
The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.
Currently supported and fractts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:
You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male) since this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the output of SSML.
If settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100?%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.

There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional thresholds filter (SDB filter). SBDs divide text into single phrases. this allows you to start reading or stop, as only the first proposition has to be synthesized, not the entire text order. thus, you can also record or stop orders on the card card orders, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.
Here you see the punctuation filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set-line recognition filter is set up automatically as a default. you can change its settings or add more punctuation filters, but beginners will not be advised.
The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out. switch off the Speaker Selection menu and type text to read. check the Speaker Selection menu, change some properties and check how the speaker selection has changed. of course, you have to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.
And ktts; then faster with reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole block, which can last very long,
You can pause or stop writing assignments on the card card even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.
For these reasons, the normal label limiter filter is automatically set up when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.
Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering).
SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (notify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.
If you have removed the normal punctuation filter from accidentally, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file.
On the card menu, you can overwrite the language preference settings for the application.
Use of the standard speaker (the top of the card reader). in other words: no speaker properties are specified.
Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of a set of speakers. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, elects & ktts; select this speaker. otherwise, elects & ktts; the speaker that best matches the original set properties.
Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.
Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.
Select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.
Since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies before you know that a particular application sends text in another language other than the one configured in the working environment.
To use all the features in the area speaker, which best matches the following, click on the default speaker selection button and then use the speaker that best matches the following.
In this case, 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without an order number the input 0 is required).
Kttsmgr installs immediately when it is started. I have compiled debug support but I don't get any backtracking.
GStreamer 0.8.x is finished. you probably need to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x the command-register-0.8 is installed. if the problem is not solved, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is probably installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.
The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play music with another application at the same time. if I stop a text order, freezes & ktts; a. on the & console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.
On your system, there is a problem that conflicts occur in ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.
I have invited an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it at festival, but ttsmgr does not display this voice.
Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / consolidate / vocals. as a guide, you can serve the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.
On the Audio card Audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizermodules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the flashcard for speakers. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.
The speaking speed settings are ignored if & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is turned into SSML.) Deactivate either the filters for the conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML conversion filter, and set up the speech speed.
I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesperson, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.
At Festival 1.95 beta, the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file will reject the GENDER-tags for converting SSML to Saber. same applies to VOICE tags.
I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can go back or forth in & forth. orders are shown, the order consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?
You may not filter interpunctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma, and semicolon). instead, use a filter for the detection limit detection instead.
Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)
GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling & ktts before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstream.freedatentop.org)
Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in audio output. if your system counts too, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktert; freezes when you stop a text order and then launch another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).
As of July 2005, aKode still does not support real breaks. if you are holding a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read more plainly.
The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speaking speed, but otherwise it is not mandatory. Debian users can install sox using the apt-get install sox command.
Have & ktts; downloaded as tarball (tar packaged), log in as a normal user and unpack the tarball into a matching folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:
In & kde; 4 the Module & arts; probably removed or at least only built on request.
The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have run time dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the Debian distribution guidelines). the configure parameter column option shows the configure parameter which causes the creation of the creation.
If this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify as option --prefix = target. for example:
On Debian systems / usr / local is the right folder for programs compiled from the sources.
CD kdecompression kttsd > inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd fractsd make su make install
Before using & ktts, first check if your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you received with the synthesizer.
Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is exposed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported.
You need to install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read websites, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.
For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.
This voice requires Festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian. if you set up the Russian votes, you need to enter MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone for the voices. select a kyrillic (8-bit-) encoding such as koi8-R.
Festival is usually included in the Linux distributions. therefore, search for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.
If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech language, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.
If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic such as koi8-R.
Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; -Synthesizer. then Festival takes over the lexikalische Analyse and & MBROLA; this produces the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from
Note that & MBROLA; not a complete language delivery system. & MBROLA; generates language from phone files. you need additional software to create this diphone. Festival generates this from & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also be generated from German lyrics dictaph. more information can be found under.
In this process, additional wrapper code is added to the festival to use & MBROLA; -voices to voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; voice files are not installed in the & MBROLA; -folder but in the folder festival / lib /. instructions can be found at
IMS English Festival is a modified version of Festival for German & MBROLA; -Voices. required is either Festival version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install festival and & MBROLA; then download MS German Festival from
Instructions can be found in the README file in the package you downloaded. (for use with Festival 2.0 the playing of the error corrections is not necessary, you only need to recompile the festival). then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sitemit.scm.
(voice-location "german _ de1 _ os" / usr / local / MBROLA / de1 "" German Female, IMS Festival de1 ") (voice-location" german _ de2 _ os ") (voice-location" german _ de3 _ os "" / usr / local / MBROLA / de3 "" German Female, IMS Festival de3 ")
On some systems you need to edit the file / etc / festival.scm. just add the lines for your installed German voices. replace the correct path in / usr / local / MBROLA /. at the time of creating this manual, the German de4, de5, or de6 voices will not work with IMS German Festival.
This procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech & MBROLA; buy and install first Festival and & MBROLA; and make sure both work. then download Festival Czech from
Unpack the program with tar into a matching folder and create the encyclopedia. the executable file festival must be in your PATH.
Download the cz2 voice file from the & MBROLA; -Page and unzip it with unzip in the & MBROLA; folder.
(set! Czech-lexicon-file "/ usr / local / festival-czech-lexicon.out") (set!) _ MBROLA _ database "/ usr / local / MBROLA / cz2" "Czech Male, MBROLA") (require'czech-MBROLA)
Festival Lite is a free, quelloffener voice synthesizer, which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages. it is a simple speech synthesizer with even sufficient voice quality.
Flite is usually included in the GNU / Linux distributions, so search for Flite first on the CDs of your distribution.
Hadifix is a two-stage voice synthesizer that works with diphons. the txt2pho program translates text into diphone and the & MBROLA; voice synthesizer is good, but the support is currently limited to a few languages. you can adjust voice, pitch, speech speed and volume over ttsmgr.
Download at least one German language file from the & MBROLA; and unzip it with unzip into the / usr / local / MBROLA folder.
Copy either txt2phorc to ~ / .txt2phorc or to / etc / txt2pho, the rc must be removed at the end of the filename.
On the card device setup, select a voice and set the paths to & MBROLA; and txt2pho correctly.
EPOS is a free, quelloffener voice synthesizer for the Czech and Slovak language. it is a simple speech synthesizer with even sufficient voice quality. with & ktert; you can only adjust the volume with this voice synthesizer.
Start kttmsg. on the tab Spokesman click Add. select the Czech or Slovak language and EPs TTS voice synthesizer. if the EPs are not in your PATH, enter the path to the programs on the card card speaker. in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs. enter in a & console; epos -h or say -h to receive further information.
FreeTTS is a free, quelloffener voice synthesizer written in & Java; i.e. you must install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; can set neither pitch, volume or speaking speed.
The command module allows you to use & tts; with any voice synthesizer, which can be controlled in a & console; on the command line.
The best way to use a command to write the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkd.conf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows the administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.
The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.
The & knetworkd.conf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:
After installation, a new module is displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetworkd.conf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu; started.
It is important to understand that & knetworkd.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and the setting of the network features enabled.
In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed during installation of & Linux; if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:
The Network Setting module is loaded when the option Network Settings is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system.
If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and the release status. by checking the setting non-restart issues, the definition can be made permanently.
Changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can enter the system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.
In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:
The Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Rider Network interfaces:
The settings of the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the Dialogue device.
By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.
By selecting Auto the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.
With the selection Manual, the TCP / IP address can be set without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address, the desired TCP / IP address has to be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnet mask is to be specified.
If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.
The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.
It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can see if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.
Depending on the need, network devices can be activated or turned off. switching on a switched-off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....
Network devices can be activated or deactivated depending on the need. switching off an activated network device can be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....
Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet that mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.
If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.
A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.
Entries can be added, removed or altered. entries can be added, removed or altered by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the buttons Hinon or Herunder in the priority list.
By clicking on the Add... button from the group machine to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. the Add New nameserver dialog will be displayed.
First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.
From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button. the Edit dialog will appear.
The list named by name specifies computer name-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used by booting when there is no DNS server available. in small, remote networks, it can replace DNS servers.
Normally the list includes some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still existing version of IP will replace version 4 in the future.
Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add... Add the New Alias dialog will appear.
Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the Add button. if the familiar computer has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias name.
Select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit... The dialog Defend Calculator will be shown.
It can be done one of the following tasks, then click OK to update the list of static hosts.
The settings made in the Network Setting module are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, in a & console, the following command must be disabled.
The site of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.
It is sufficient to install the binary distributions (usually rpm packages) if & kde; and Qt are installed.
Installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:
Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.
For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.
This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkd.conf. the following commands should do this.
In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, and in the second section all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files will be discussed.
This section cannot replace any further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is mediated in a small (home) network.
At the moment, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread distribution. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future. this description is therefore currently concentrated on the common IPv4.
One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in other networks, on & eg, the network administrator is the contact point that assigns a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily.
When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.
Of course, access to the Internet can be made possible for such machines by setting a gateways.
For smaller networks, mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.
In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are participants in the same subnet.
Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for IP redirection.
The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a dedicated loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.
In this section are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkd.conf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.
This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if in case of active DSL links there is another content as defined there.
For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly re-sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.

& dat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which moreover provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packaging.
Before a tape can be used it must be done by & Kdat; it can be done in three ways:
& Kdat; file the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognizes and dat; if not on the tape, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.
Recognizes and dat; the template, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.
If everything went smoothly, the icon for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was mounted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the tape.
Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:
& Kdat; gives by modifying the symbol for the tape to realize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the band can now be thrown out without danger.
Before a band can be used by & Kdat, it must be formatted by & Kdat.
A tape-type must be formatted before you can use it to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting with & kdat;. if your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this must be done before you start formatting the tape. floppy disk drives usually require formatting the tape, while DAT drives are not formatted.
After entering the band name and capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the band is automatically integrated and ready to use.
Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:
Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.
Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.
Select files in the local file tree with a check. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.
Right-click on the local file tree and select Save in the Save...
Once the backup has been started, the dialog box for backup opens. in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings.
When you confirm the settings, the dialog box will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.
Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.
Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.
Right-click on any of the archives and select the menu item Check...
Once the check procedure has been started, the dialog box for Verification will appear. in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for verification.
If you have confirmed the review settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.
Before you can reestablish, the files to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:
Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be recovered.
Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.
Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...
Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog box for Restore appears. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery.
When you confirm the restore settings, the dialogue will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.
Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to rebuild the band index file on the basis of the tape content. this deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index in two ways from the band:
This will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:
The current job folder where backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.
For all files listed under backup files, only the files located on the same file system are backed up as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.
Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.
The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.
Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.
The functionality of the buttons is; & lt; and lt; files were not fully implemented at the time the documentation was created.
The settings can be set up using the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:
The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding version of the tape.
If this setting is active, transmitted, and dat, before the tape is mounted, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.
If the option is enabled, & Kdat; lock the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.
If the option is enabled, when loosening the integration of & data, the band will be ejected automatically. do not use this option on floppy drives.
If the option is enabled, & Kdat; the hardwarded block size for the tape drive must be changed. not all drives support variable block sizes. whether this setting is active or not, you need & dat; in any case report the block size for your tape drive.
If & Kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:
(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band was formatted.
The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.
The remaining files on the tape are tar files which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.
Check the contents of a tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted.
& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information on problems that occur on their server.
& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.
In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can provide quick access to information on problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.
In current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. this includes:
Support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba
Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.
As you can see in the screenshot below, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.
After the start & ksystemlog; first try to open the main protocol file of the system - the system log. if this is not shown, and it opens instead of a small message box, so you have not started with system administrator privileges. under Linux, the protocol files are usually found in the / var / log folder, for which normal users usually have no permission to read.
You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or by entered strings. the list of the log lines will now be automatically changed, so that only log lines will appear which match the selected filter. in the default setting, the list of logs will only be displayed if the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.
You can, of course, select another entry at this point, and the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the process column, and then enter the name of a process in the filter bar, and then show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.
This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to identify the important protocol lines. minutes lines of the level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as the step critic's protocol lines. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.
If you want to display only certain processes (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.
In addition, you can activate the To-New Lines option in the main window context menu to display all new incoming log lines.
& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.
& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Here you will find more information about the sources of reference from & ksystemlog;.
& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive
Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and so named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.
System V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for program start-up when running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than traditional BSD init.
I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about myself: -).
The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel first looks under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.
The SysV Init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. .dat you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:
Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start when you boot the system or when you switch to another run level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services don't include such things like setserial, which is only started once. such calls are owned by rc.local.
Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it. you can also put a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot up.
The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.
The default Runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning you should see a line like the following:
At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default level 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then get it repaired by rebooting the system and doing the following:
But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:
You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.
How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:
This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called up with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.
Some people want to have a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; I could also have a user runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.
Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.
Using & ksysv; using a mouse or any other pointing device is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Runtime levels to start (or stop) at this level.
You can also move scripts between level n or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this only happens if you pull an entry from the area of available system services.
Note: items are moved when you move them into a new area. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target zone -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.
The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.
Note: currently there is no way to restore items thrown into the trash bin. so be careful.
You can use the Tab key to activate the different work areas (Available System Services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.
To move an entry into another run level, move it into the clipboard with cut-out (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired level by inserting (using Ctrl; V).
To manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by re-typing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.
Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.
All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. defaults are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.
I experimented with the standard Runtimn, and now the machine is constantly reproducing. what can I do?
Enter the linux single at the LILO prompt and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runtime level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).
I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.
If you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.
The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.
If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are needed by the system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) will simply end without message when their configuration files are not available or installed incorrectly.
The meaning of the & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual.
This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.
To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read Chapter Adjustment by & kuser;
After you have made changes, you need to save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the save in the File menu.
& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user and group Properties dialog.
Some flashcards will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users will create a card card on which you can configure individual settings. additional card cards will appear if shadow passwords or / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unix.
The card card password management will appear if shadow passwords or / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unix.
This card only appears if space restriction (quota) is enabled and initialized for at least one-in-one filesystem (recognizably to the quota.user / quota.group file on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limited space limitations of each file in KB:
These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected by means of the field file system with space restriction.
The map groups are informed about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can be a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field.
The Properties dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.
To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user respectively the selected group works analog.
With this module, you can install the LILO bootmanager, add, remove and change boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.
