Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.
And that was very exciting for me.
My love for America is extraordinarily great.
Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.
In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.
As a 14-year-old, I saw the magnificent Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless journalist exposing the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who were interested in his interest.
I was caught.
Free to Method Man, "I was, as if that was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."
And the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the US.
I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.
I even wrote a very shameful letter of love about its size.
Then Donald Trump came.
Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.
The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.
He never holds with his mind behind the mountain as you say so nicely.
He tells us exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.
Nevertheless, people reacted to his statements and voted for him in droves.
The 13 million votes that he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the Party.
I was speechless.
Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?
I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time.
For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silk, director of the journalism programme that welcomes people from all over the world, a deeply believing human being with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.
"" "Trumps" "" "Weltanschauung" "" "did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of Cincinnati Inquirer." ""
"" "Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "in the game." ""
Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for life the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.
She is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who has always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.
Then there were Andrew gooey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.
These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.
While Trump paved the way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.
However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.
On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt for non-white people.
The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.
Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as racists.
To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.
This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.
It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.
Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?
In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?
Perhaps. perhaps.
However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.
This "Whitelash" (note from white against all other ethnicities): white and whiplash based on white and whiplash, which means so much like skidding trauma), as the big Van Jones described, exactly what made America so great.
Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.
For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan man whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.
With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a vast part of the white American of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.
In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.
In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.
On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.
"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Khan, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.
"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""
"would Muslims have a place in your America?"
"" "" "" "no!" "" "roared the crowd." ""
"do Latinos have a place in your America?"
"no!" they answered.
Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "
"no!" they cried, and their voices became louder.
"" "" "" "if anyone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""
"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""
Mr. Khan concluded by saying: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.
The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.
That is now Trumps Land, said the message.
And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America anymore.
And that breaks my heart.

Out of the Poor to the Stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through garbage

What does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community have in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?
That the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...
Music that lives with the waste
Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.
For some years now, La banda de Música (music gang) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them with their musical instruments.
A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.
The Guardian wrote about this project:
The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and the violence of gangs.
But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered his youth a rare glimmer of hope.
The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:
As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.
They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play.
Music from garbage
More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest landfill of Asunción in the capital of Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste material:
Music with remanufactured instruments, composed of local solid waste materials, is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments.
The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made of the trash.
The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.
In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:
First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.
This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.
Today there is a whole orchestra performed on instruments made of recycled material called The Recycled Orchestra.
"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""
Every year, the world produces about one billion tons of trash.
Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.
And here they turn him into something beautiful.
"" "" "" "landfill Harmonic" "" "follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music all around the world." ""
The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:
"" "" "" "these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing." ""
Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.
This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.
Re-publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content together.
In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the land of Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa was sought.
The East African countries were accordingly affrighted and somewhat inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.
Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorites, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to stop one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit.
"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""
In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.
Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillage of fish stocks in the country.
The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing) in 2012.
The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that then expelled the Premier from their waters.
"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support." ""
Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.
By the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.
But while actions against illegal fishing were impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the pace of snails, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communications platform.
There, for example, the individual countries can share lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.
Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.
This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its catch fish on the way to other ships.
Ideally, such examinations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on their way and possibly whether they have a criminal record.
On the basis of this information, countries opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.
"" "" "" "then there are significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile." ""
"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""
A closed front
The so-called platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters.
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world, including those illegal fishers.
Their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, imaginary seeds, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.
"" "they deliberately use the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-fully organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier a ship could fish illegal and a country could then say" "" "You may not run my harbor." "" "" ""
"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole now attempts to close FISH-i." ""
So far the closed front works.
Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 research of suspicious ships.
It has exposed criminal networks that had spread bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found and found fleeting ships.
Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authorities to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances.
"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime" "", "says Bergh." ""
He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.

Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps pinpoint the illegal ships that are happy to hide.
"" "illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""
Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.
Copeland is therefore helping to build a system linking different levels of information. it should help FISH-i find criminals with greater precision.
A model program
But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?
John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.
Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that offers satellite data and which can display the position of each trackable ship worldwide.
"" "together with the neighbours, to get a better picture of who is doing what is happening - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation." ""
"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""
There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.
Ships which formerly were fishing without license and had hardly expected consequences, know now that they are being watched.
According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile accounted for a 33% increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats buy more licenses.
After FISH-i had helped Somalia to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there towing nets on board which were forbidden.
Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.
"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy us," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object" "". "" ""
In 2015 six countries joined forces to form the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With certainty, the aim is to allow even more of such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.
Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was flying under false flag. and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited.
"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""
For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working across the oceans.

The road movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.
They are seen as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's disrepair.
This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.

After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void, reacted by gathering in the streets.
Under hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: Venezuela's refunds), both images of these demonstrations and arguments can be found for and against them.
The debate will also be held in other parts of the country, including the lowland Barinas, in the Andes-regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the federal state of Nueva Esparta.
The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by acute lack of food and medicines.
Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the impeachment of the current president, Nicolás Maduro, but in the end the detention of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.
Marianne Díaz, co-operative at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:
In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and spiral rate are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on impeachment is considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.
The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (around: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called for a twelve-hour strike on the following day, as well as a march to Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, to continue to block the referendum.
Twitter has been commented on Twitter as follows:
It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil war and on November 3 all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.

@ mariaCorinaYA and @ soyfdelrincon: "tomorrow we will go to the road with the National Assembly - @ NicolasMaduro must go away."
"the reconquest of Venezuela"
"" "the first demonstration in the context of the action programme" "" "The reconquest of Venezuela" "" "took place on Wednesday, October 26." ""
The pictures of the marches that are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also clashes with policemen and supporters of the government.
"" "one of the most shared pictures shows a demonstrator calling through the shields:" "" "will you kill me because I am hungry?" "" "" ""
"" "" "" "will you kill me, because I am hungry?" "" "cried the Venezuelan." ""
It is enough, without shit.

On Twitter images that talk about confrontations as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.
Particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.
There, demonstrators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government, according to their own statement.
Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral but the protests continued.
In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:
The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise one could see something that many National Guards do not have!
Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the round, which forms the amount of repression per day:
Thus dictatorship has suppressed the country.
Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a tendering procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.
Myteks Media Labs:
Nicolás and Diosdado say that 1% of the signatures are fake.
Here is your impeachment!
On the road!
Others are further analysing these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government, which, from its point of view, had little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to refrain from mutilating critical voices:
They took us so much - but also the fear!
Marches always increase in frequency and intensity.
Some Venezuelans reported to the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or shopping.

This is an adaptable version of an interview published by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentine news site.
The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.
When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.
As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba.
The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigates crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.
Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.
Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.
He kept his family secret for 34 years.
In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.
I felt like a secret agent.
As a child with 15 years of age, it is not noticeable that one is manipulated by his father.
At that time I could not realise that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.
Luis Alberto had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Military Intelligence Department of 141 in La Perla prison.

Archive of files.
But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.
No, this is the story of Luis Quijjanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the amount of atrocities he had experienced as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.
His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation.
From the sports hall to the military base
When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.
All called him "Kent."
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend thereon.
He said:
You are an asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP.
Take care not to kidnap you one day and I will have to save you.
The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo - Revolutionary Popular Army - the military arm of the Argentinian revolutionary workers "party.
That is why he forbid me to go to the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.
He told me that I would be a secret agent.
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.
At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.
These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.

'dawned the prisoners are tortured. '
My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.
At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.
When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible.
All of it was stolen.
He gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lumps of silver.
On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were dropped and stopped me with a guard.
Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:
There the prisoners are tortured.
I saw in and saw a couch where people were tortured.
She looked like a cot and metal feathers.
Later I found out that they fastened the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.
They seldom professed a man with handcuffs to the bed, cast it with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts to the genitals.

The stench there was horrible... like a filthy windy.
Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.
I could never forget this smell.
"" "and I asked myself," "" "How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?" "" "" ""
'I knew these people were killed '
When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated and bound with handcuffs.
He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.
In the background I saw a series of mattresses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied in hands and feet.
Close to the entrance, people quiet on the mattresses.
"" "when my father noticed I saw the prisoners, he said," "" "What do you look like, asshole?" "" "" ""
"" "I replied," "" "Why did you get me otherwise?" "" "" ""
I knew these people were killed.
They were thrown into a pit, and were killed by soldiers and buried.
I know this because my father told me at home.
In addition to La Cuadra there were several rooms that were designated as offices.
"" "I know that" "" "Palito" "" "Romero put together a man there and killed him." ""
(according to survivors, the civilian Jorge Romero, who was also indicted at La Perla-Ribera trial, was beaten to death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina.
In the following video, Emilio Fessia, head of the memorial La Perla, leads through the former torture chambers.
The way you came here is also the way in which the abducted came here.
If you look at the map, you will see that they took about this route and then tortured for the first time.
Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.
When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came up that they were to be laid.
This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.
The 'booty'
My father brought home all sorts of stolen things.
At that time I had no idea what the "booty" - as they called it - was.
But when I was at the military later, I was in the gendarmerie - it was clear to me that war booty is a bayonet or perhaps military signs that you have fought against an enemy you fought against.

But if you go into a house and steal the fridge, turntables, clothes, paintings, money... that's not a booty but vandalism.
This is theft.
I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism.
I just don't understand.
I was an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to invade a house and steal everything in it.
I don't understand how my father could do that.
"" "once he called me a criminal and I replied," "" "And you who steal cars on the road?" "" "" ""
You're not a criminal?
He exploded with anger, struck me and cried:
If you go so far, I'll find you and kill yourself.
We don't need anyone else to do that!
That was my father.
I have no good memory of him.
When I said in the process, I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a pullover of wool. I had both my father from La Perla.
We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.
At that time, the defense accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put a burden on what they wanted.
I was there anyway to say.
'Enforced disappearance of the corpse is the last heinous act '
Now, where I am older, I feel regret.
I have children. once you have children, you realize the value of a life.
One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.
I even went so far to say:
"" "" "" "well, you executed people during the dictatorship, but why do the corpses vanish?" ""
Why do children kidnap?
One day my father brought a girl back home, whose mother was killed.
She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.
I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?
They could have put them in jail.
I guess it was simply decided not to kill these people, but why would their corpses vanish?
Did these people not even have families that could be handed down to their mortal remains?
The enforced disappearance of the corpses is the last heinous act that can be done to a human being.
My father told me when the democracy was reintroduced, they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners.
"" "they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." "" "you'll never find anything," "" "said my father." ""
But of course anything remains.
'I have seen how you killed humans! '
Only to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.
I was even with the gendarmerie.
I just told the truth about 20 criminals, including my father.
The thought to show my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest.
I gave him accusations because of all the atrocities that I had to experience because of him.
"" "then he suddenly said," "" "I don't know. I have killed anyone." "" "" ""
"" "I felt internally displaced and asked myself what all the exaggerated patriotism and the" "" "Western and Christian feelings" "" "they supposedly defended were good." ""
Then I screamed:
How can you tell me something like that?
"" "" "" "I have seen how you killed people!" ""
You have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate.
"" "he only answered," "" "Well, show me." "" "" ""
That's exactly what I did.
In 2010 I made the first ad.
I finally realized that he was a criminal.
No one can blame me for being prejudiced. I finally testified against my own father.
Luis Alberto Quijano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial.
He was charged with 416 crimes: including severe, illegal deprivation of liberty in 158 cases, torture in 154 cases, murder in 98 particularly severe cases, torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidnapping of a child under 10 years.

After four years, in which more than 581 witnesses were heard, the historic La Perla Ribera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 716 victims finally in August.
43 repressors were found guilty of crimes against humanity. in 28 cases, the Court suspects lifelong imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years. in six cases, there were acquittal claims.
Eleven of the 54 defendants died during the trial.
# LaPerlaj: murder, torture and rape by officers. # EsWarstate terrorism
All the defendants were members of the military during the dictatorship, including former military personnel, former police and civilian employees.
Piero De Monti was kidnapped and brought to La Perla together with his pregnant wife in June 1976.
He addressed the following words:
La Perla was a death factory designed by inhuman heads.
"" "" "" "the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims." ""
Claudio Orosz, a lawyer founded in 1995 by the Argentinian organization H.I.J.O.S., who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared, said:
The process took more than three years, but the research for it took 39 years.
In March 2007, the Argentinean government handed over the land on which La Perla was located, so that a memorial could be erected there, which is now led by human rights organisations.

"" "an error in translation makes elderly people in Kyoto a" "" "terrible driver" "" "" ""
The shield with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto, where you can prolong your driving license.
The photo was spread in the social media.
Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine.
In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving license have been witnessing a particularly misfortunaty translation last month.
On a sign the Japanese word (koreibelsha), the "older motorists" means, wrongly - perhaps also with evil rear-thought & # 8212; as "fearful motorists" translated.
The wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st - 20th.
Adaptation of the original photographs by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.
The fault was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a population of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.
The Kyoto Shimbun published in Kyoto has written:
"how could there be an English translation?
This proves that no one has read the translation correction.
"" "this is an insult to elderly people and simply unacceptable in an international city like Kyoto," "" "Holmes said." ""
"" "the English translation was first removed." "" "terrible drivers" "" "(German:" "" "terrible drivers" "" ") was later replaced by the more appropriate, even grammatically correct designation" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""
The police of the Kyoto Prefecture have apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.
A blogger related the apologies as follows:
"" "" "" "we are really sorry that elderly people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""
"" "the Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of" "" "fearful" "" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:" ""
"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause for concern." ""
In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a proportion of 10%.
Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.
This increased its share to 17.7%.
While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.
The name not mentioned in the article published in Yahoo's article published comments on the light, which show what prejudices some Japanese seem to rise against older drivers:
The article on Yahoo over the translation error was given among others the following comments:
"" "-" "" "Is this (" "" "awful motorists" "" ") not the reality?" "" "" ""
"" "-" "" "So wrong is the translation actually not, isn't it?" "" "" ""
"" "-" "" "I don't think it's a real translation error." "" "" ""
There are not a few such comments.
Why "Engrish" is so widespread throughout Asia
Translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia.
The Engrish.com website is a treasure trove for these bizarre mistakes in English.

The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.
To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and provide active language skills to transfer it to the target language.
The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.
For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.

Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language, who could translate translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.
Some companies that do not have foreign employees can nevertheless produce translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is valued as the best, becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.

Mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results.
The confused and enigmatic sentences resulting from machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.
Some of the strangest British formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.

Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but from large companies or from the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.
In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translation.
Venezuela: take up protests and censorship on internet and television
Main page of the portal "Naval con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).
On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.
Other users later wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.
Other online broadcasters were also taking photographs of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositional groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.
The protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.
Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was kidnapped, and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.
# Zenit: enables your VPN.
It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again blocked.
This is from @ VivoPlayNet.
Offers like Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.
Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting about protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."
I registered at @ vivoplaynet again without cable TV and informative national TV channels.
It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters lemonade.
The local NGO Vega Filintro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.
Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond correctly to requests of certain domains.
If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies wrongly or refuses the request when calling such a website.
We confirm a DNS block: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet
VPITV, a third locked channel, was broadcast on Thursday 6 April when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas live, was imprisoned.
Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.
Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.
Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making Venezuelans more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country.
In Paraguay too many girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Alvarenga was a criadita as a child. now she visits the house where she worked for years.
Today, Tina is fighting for the rights of children and gathers evidence of other crimes that have become victims of abuse and discrimination.

The following article is the shortened version of a report of structural, which is published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.
The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying Cows, Missing Schools") edited and re-released by Global Voices of Latin America.
Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.
Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her. "she's like a daughter for us.
"" "the one that has become something" "", "she said." ""
But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.
When she was ten years old she began to work as a criadita for the family. in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school are called criadis.
The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their minor daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.
However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and mistreatment - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.
This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations.
After graduating, Alvarenga worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.
She spoke with criadis - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.
She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude inoculated by the cripta guarantees in general silence.
"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.
On the one hand, there is the family that their daughter believes in the belief that she can complete her education, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself" to another family.
On the other hand, the family that takes the girl with her and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.
The victims of the Criadazgo
When the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later.
Sometimes they never know of it.
In January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, got a face.
When Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent shocks. shortly afterwards she died.
She was 14 years old.
She was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as an official at the Einwohnermeldeamt.
Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.
At the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck Marín as long as she suffered lethal injuries.
This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.
A few days later the media reported on the incident.
They stressed that the murdered child was a cricket.
Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela held the deep-rooted practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.
They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."
Several dozen people gathered in protest and demanded that there should be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.
The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.
"in Paraguay, more cows are registered than children," said Tina Alvarenga.
Without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.
Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.
The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for swift investigation of the case.
They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.
If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín may be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.
The everyday life of a Criadita
The criadis are not only exploited as workers, they also live in isolation from other girls at their age.
Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Jobbik in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.
Their brothers now had to go all the work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.
But they all went to school.
Only Tina was sent as a Criadita to the capital Asunción.
In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.
She had to share the time so she stayed for a while to learn.
She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.
For example, it cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.
When the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn.
The sooner it was done with learning, the more free time she had.
But also this time was limited, because she had to make dinner for her employer.
Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.
The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.
In some evenings, the host Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorials from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."
In doing so, he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.
"" "he thought she was intelligent, but did not stay with her." "" "the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "" "she says." ""
"" "" "" "they did not often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would" "" "learn bad habits" "" "there again." "" "they said that Alvarenga, who belonged to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would once again speak their mother tongue guaraní." ""
Their masters were afraid that they would lose the education they had allowed them to lose again.
But she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.
Also in school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken of is mobbing and harassment to which criadis are exposed when they go to school.
Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.
I couldn't invite anyone home to me. I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.
In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.
The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.
Society approves the Criadazgo
In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where job ads for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay can be shared.
The administrator of the group is Pepa Kostianovsky, a city councillor in the district of Asunción.
Hello! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter, who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon.
To learn.
Please contact us.
Starting Monday, if possible.
The ad received five "Likes" and many commentaries.
A woman from the site Ñemby wrote that she had an eleven-year-old girl and she gave her telephone number.
Another woman who also came out of Ñemby offered her 15 year old niece. "she likes small children and is very handsome," she wrote.
"" "in the third comment," "" "a girl from the heartland who wants to work" "" "was written." ""
Then the author switched to the display again:
Dear friends, I've found one. I'll see if it works with it.
Thank you, I write again when something is.
The business was completed.
In the prologue to the report Criaditas, ¿hasta cubándo?
(criadis, how long?), a collection of testimonies of former crimes, writes Ortiz:
In the course of our history, we have managed to abolish systems like slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice from the Early History of Paraguay, in which the Spanish Conquistadores, the Conquistadores, the women of the Guaraní people were enslaved and subjected to Spanish indoctrination) and the system of the Mensú (where the workers are treated as semi-slaves).
The social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as the Criadazgo.
Bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

Published under the Public Domain CC0.
Sixty-one Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to a bill on "the regulations regarding the use and benefits of social networks."
"" "" "" "when it is adopted by the Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""
"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up that is in charge of giving citizens a permit to use social media." ""
Within six months with the adoption of the Act, users on the site must register with their proper names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks.
If it fails to do so, it could bring a fine of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.
The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, videocaching and text."
It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose registration. it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies.
Riyad Abdul Sattler, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users got a username and password from the Ministry of Communications to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "
This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall at the national level around Facebook. because of that, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network.
But so far it is not known that such plans exist.
Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.
"" "Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technologist (in German" "" "Senior Research Techniologist" "" ") at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, on German" "" "Egyptian initiative for personal rights" "" "), told Global Voices:" ""
"" "" "" "I strongly doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology." ""
In my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.
If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court case.
Technically, this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.
"" "" "" "to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it comes into the plenary debate." ""
Whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is consistent with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in which the control will be maximised and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof.
Last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a criminal offence against cyber crime in which a life imprisonment for those found guilty of threatening "public order" and "raising protest."
How a Kurdish nature protector protects the Persian leopard in the Iraq marked by war

High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.
A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which strewn through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus Saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of wild animals, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loot.
Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?
"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""
The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is small and goes against zero. therefore, when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.
As a trained biologist Raza is passionately fond of a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.
She has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.
Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan Region.
Sebastian Meyer, an award-winning photographer and filmmaker, has produced this video for Ensia.
His works have been published in numerous international publications including TIME, Sunday Times Magazine, FT Magazine, Washington Post and The New York Times.
Meyer made films for National Geographic, PBS, CNN and HBO.

Six years after the tsunami: the state of things in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate
"view from the Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."
Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and the region is still busy with reconstruction.

In early March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo daily documented the progress achieved in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had sparked the disaster.
The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a prefecture in Japan's northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.
Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring islands Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, as the tsunami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map.
The Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.
The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the local residents' lives.
The detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of those affected.
The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate
The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare-homes were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.
Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed here.
Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.
At the same time, six years after the disaster, the evacuation of accommodation establishments, evacuated by accommodation, could be relocated to final replacement houses.
After the threefold disaster, almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes.
In December 2016 more than 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.
Almost 40 percent of the people who evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 were still living in emergency shelters whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees who lived in homes after the disaster were resettled into final homes.
For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.
The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures
Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1,100 schools affected by disaster have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.
Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.
While almost 100 per cent of the fisheries "ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation, only 30 percent of the fisheries" ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.
The tsunami and the nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land.
Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed land in Fukushima.
It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land by Fukushima lie in the "nuclear proliferation zone."
In two of the three prefectures tourism has recuperated, but Fukushima is still lagging behind.
The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.
However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.
Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?
In order to obtain a complete picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation centres. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how her empathy with the tsunami-risk has changed.
In their introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:
The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.
The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.
However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that hasn't been done enough in disaster prevention.
How it stands for those who had to evacuate from the Fukushima prefecture
In its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.
Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.
Some 75,000 people from Fukushima were displaced in areas outside the prefecture by 160,000 people.
At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses.
According to the 2017 status, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside of their home prefecture.
In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation centres are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima need to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.
The world is small: our podcast "Into the Deep"
When people from other countries meet, who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater at first than the similarities.
After a while, one often recognizes that one more combines than it seems at first sight.
These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.
In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global links. in our Into the Deep podcast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.
We speak with five Global Voices members, who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.
Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Ehuman explains how the love of music has strengthened its affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has gathered in a small village in Madagascar.

Brazilian activist in artificial coma after being beaten up by the police at nationwide demonstrations
Left: the attack against Mateus Ferreira da Silva. photo: Luiz da Luz. publication with permission.
Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widely used photo.
A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer hit him with a stick against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. across the country, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.
Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.
Doctors operated him on this Saturday and moved him to an artificial coma.
His condition is considered critical.
The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.
On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stick. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.
After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio had been suspended from active service until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident.
The pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in Goiânia (photos: Luiz da Luz).
If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.
The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, distributed the video taken by Luiz da Luz, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics hurry shortly afterwards.
Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, is also submerged in social networks.
In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.
For the family of Mateus who lives in another state, internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2,700 Euro) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in hospital.
"be brave, Mateus.
Against police violence. "
The drawing was divided several times in social networks.
By: Heitor Vilela. publication with permission.
On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado invites further violent attacks against activists in Goiás:
Goiás has experienced a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father, because he left the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police joined a WhatsApp group, only to criminalise teachers, and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policeman who hit him with a stick in his face.
Police assault artillery
"" "" "" "Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police action against demonstrators last Friday." ""
Police officers used rubber bullets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had erected a stage for orators.
The MEP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.
This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.
Once again, the Brazilian media ousted street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window disc.
The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were targeting a broken glass window to illustrate their front pages illustratively with a photograph.
O Globo, on the other hand, preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.
There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window of window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.
This must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of damage.

The Uncharted Villages in Cuba
With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)
The local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on a Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no significant sugar harvest on site.
It was two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.
After laying down, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory lost its facilities gradually until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.
About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.
Some changed the work.
Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.
Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive him of his sleep.
He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are in operation again because they have been preserved.
That was something he didn't expect.
Nene seems to have heard exactly that in Mañalam I would get the sugar cane mill, but the promise was not kept.
The sugar cane industry resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.
In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.
The news would have been a motive for calming the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.
Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?
The old railway platform of the congregation saw better times.

The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.
The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.
They left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).
The solution to unemployment?
The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.
Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again some decade ago.
From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 cent per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural Prospectives" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.
If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.
Not everything went well
"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "said the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""
From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.
In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories came to a halt, with more than 65 million people receiving their full salary for further education.
The same happened in the sugar cane mill Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.
Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.
"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeats most," "" "Scam" "". "" ""
Almost all respondents said in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.
In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.
Before the first year of birth, the first letters began to come.
Officially composed documents were distinguished only concerning the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.
All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister was able to approve every removal.
From then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters came more and more frequently.
Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers still operating in operation," he assures.
Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.
He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he was building.
With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.
The most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important worktop producer has been extinguished.
In many cases, no alternatives were created for the jobs and services that the systems generated in the congregations in which they were located.
We will never know whether during the mammoth speech of 21 October 2002, the then President looked in the eyes of the people present, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well.
The price of the population for the closing of sugar cane factories
Sugar cane has been extracted only high by milling since 2004.
(photo: Julio Batista)
After two years, the folk group Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.
When the sugar cane mill closed, or rather than they began to unmask, they also stopped to asphalve the road, this disadvantaged also other farms.
Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.
They became spare parts.
Without prospect of the future, many young people also left the region.
In the area, a food factory was created whose production does not even serve the care of the community.
The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.
At the end of 2016 Nene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the village where he began to work.
Forty-nine tithes bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand peso a month to spend the years in retirement in Mañalich.
Mr. Nene, a man of black skin colour, small, with a few teeth and a clear voice, is not a supporting person, yet he does not forgive the lies you told him.
They torment him for ten years.
Nene is retiring at age 65, not because he lacks strength, but because he is bitter.

First Nations youngsters use hip-hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
Recording of a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.
Photo used with the permission of N'we Jinan.
Young people from the First Nations communities all over Canada concern themselves with themes that are important to them. they do so using Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.
As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, since 2014 workshop leaders bring mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.
The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and joined North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.
The workshop thus enters into discussions on topics such as "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.
These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.
Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the State of Nebraska.
This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the KitSummonum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in West Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.
Most of the cases were not solved.
The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of globalisation.
Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters are not always proficient in the languages of the First Nations.
In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.
The youngsters involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-Group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.
On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as is a translation into English, which is translated into German:
Sometimes I feel as if no one ever is interested in me
But I try to continue my days on Earth
This is the day when you will hear our cry
Because as a youth we have lost our way in life
But I believe that we will rise one day
I don't want to see how they live a bad life
This is how they can grow and as well as our youth go forward
So they can do what the Creator has ordained for.
In the commentary, the reader and supporters of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to syllname (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):
In Japan, plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
Plastic dishes (for the most part) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan.

In Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes.
To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (for the most part, "plastic models of dishes") are displayed by any food served in this restaurant.
The customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.
There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.
In the death district of Kappabashi there are a multitude of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.
For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend is turning them into striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.
Naver Matome published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin zpuru.
Now in a special sale: new plastic ribbons decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.
Many of these artificial food were turned into kitschy gatherings, as in this case, fridge magnets:
Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.
The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more complex.
In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.
For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.
We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.
And here is an apple that keeps your cell phone:
Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for your mobile phone, this is a great design.
And this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.
Some mobile stand and cell phone designers will allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.
On Twitter some users had their doubts:
"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""
I think I'll be the only one.
This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.
Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.
There are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.
Other scurrile plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.
If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry.
The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made.
A Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
"" "" "" "for the victims of the fight against drug dealers." "" "" ""

In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the mischief and killed appear on a regular basis only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.
The reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of Sinaloa cartels, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict to the background.
The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looking at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with pain.
Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.
For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking"), which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were engaged in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.
Animal Político describes the project like this:
Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.
The effects are far more profound.
For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.
The Pain of Victims
"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid life changes" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""
A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend.
Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews just one day.
"" "priests:" "" "like every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves again today for the task we have placed to go and to search for the tombs, for the people we have loved." "" "" ""
Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.
He was 28 when he disappeared.
He has three children.
He worked in an electrical business in El Naranjo.
On October 13th he left the house.
"" "on October 15th, he should be back, but he never came again." "" "Emma Veleta:" "" "it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship." ""
There is also my mother, who is here also here with me.
At the moment she has no income.
You are entitled to the insurance of my father, but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate.
"" "where are we going to get this?" "" "" ""
The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:
"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""
The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.
Here are some excerpts from the stories.
KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.
Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:
I've known illness and sensational journalism for some years now.
I pass the newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from experts.
It brings me out of the version.
Sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.
I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.
She writes on:
No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people listen to songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.
For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.
"" "the boundlessness of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by being" "" "soaked." "" "" ""
I think they try to argue that they are spared from such tragedies if they do not stir and are still.
Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the entry "Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family with threats was pillaged." in this she describes how armed criminals were squeezing money from their business month by month, until they had torn apart the business in the end, but also tore their family apart.
You think of everything you lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.
The pain of it never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.
Habits have changed, phone numbers too.
We only contact ourselves if it is absolutely necessary.
The farther we are from each other, the better.
She concluded with the words:
We want the others to be arrested, as you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.
In these awful days I wondered if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.
"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation committed by violence." "" "" ""
In the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?
How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?
He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.
Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.
He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every age.
But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.
When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.
But this was not the day when his childhood ended.
His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.
When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was like this:
Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was overthrown by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.
In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizen's Council for Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government.
In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office had 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.
These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.
Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we must not forget.
In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal Político founded the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.
If a picture is worth a thousand untrue words
"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNMENT: this article and the pages to which he links include images on which violence is depicted.
The fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or exposing a falsification.
But what is the year after something has appeared the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.
Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).
Since its first publication, it has been misleading to image tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.
This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.
It raises questions about our desire for images on news.
What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
In 2010, a tanker traversed the village of Sange in the east of DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died there.
After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated it. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate.
Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.
Representatives of the authorities described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of homes, including a movie theater near which was full of people watching the World Cup.
Houses burned and charded corpses were scattered in the streets.
Many people were burnt to ignorance.
A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident portray the horrible scenes of this day.
Above is an example of this.
It shows rows of charded bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at it.
But here the story does not end.
Over the years the same photo was taken over several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.
What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote island of Baga and Doro Gowon.
Eyewitnesses have reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee.
Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were found in streets and bushes.
There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.
"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said Human Rights Watch." ""
Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.
The follow-up time could only be illustrated by satellite images.
The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).
And here the picture from DR Congo appeared again when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:
That is Nigeria.
A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.
They are not Charlie.
They are dead.
In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has been documenting access to Nigeria since 2014.
In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass killings.
Yet another step further personal comments such as this example falsely relates the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.
The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.
According to a flash report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike, rape and several dead, some by burning.
While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:
This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which falsely claimed in 2012 that the President of Myanmar's Thein Being said that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.
The original contribution, which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.
Other news organisations named AFP as their source also falsely attributed Thein to being this statement, but had not related the image from DR Congo.
The global reach of false information
Traces of these false declines date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually from all over the world.
An "reverse image search" enables you to see how far information can transcend boundaries.
An inverse picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion images (as of 3 May 2017), which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo.
They come from a mixing mask of private pages, social media platforms and community and national publications and are available in many different languages including English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.
Some have sent false reports, some have tried to expose the falsifications.
We have enclosed examples of abusive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of what side they have been published on. as a result, we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone.
From the countries listed below (which have been linked to each other in some cases), several examples of abusive usage can come from.
Here are some cases that can now be rinsed completely (on the card in orange):
Map: News frames.
National examples of false couplings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar.
The orange countries point to pages or servers, which are still available through examples of falsifications or falsifications.
The countries in Gray are examples that, according to the metadata and information available via TinEye, probably also show forgery examples.
As a reminder, the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo (in blue).
Algeria, 2012. "what is happening in Burma-Myanmar?" a link to the image taken from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum (aimed at Algerians and interested Arabs) as part of a thread to the "war of Buddhists against Muslims."
Brazil, 2011. "cena Chocante!
Cristòs queimades vivos!
Daddy ou fso? "(shocking scene!)
Christians burned alive!
True or false?).
One side that raised rumours was that the said photo shows Christians who were killed by Muslims.
Canada, 2015.
In this paper, a blogger from Quebec City names not only the false report but also discusses the misuse of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria, as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the tragedies involved in it (in DR Congo and beyond).
"" "Ecuador, 2013." "" "en Nigeria están quemando a los cristianos" "" "(In Nigeria they burn Christians)." ""
In this article about explosions in northern Kani in Nigeria, published in the newspaper La República, the district is identified as the Christian section of the village.
La República cited as its source the Spanish news agency EFE (where it is not known whether the original report has included the picture).
France, 2015.
Twittering contributions after the Boko Haram massacre like this one, who used the image from DR Congo to illustrate the "atrocities of Islam," have clearly seen no sides like Hoaxbster who disprove this.
Hoaxaster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria, then promoted by a post by US-American, anti-Islamic commentator Pamela Geller.
Germany, 2017. "genocide against Muslims continues to be silent in Myanmar, Nobel Peace Prize winner."
This article draws attention to the continuing distress of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, but quoted the work of an article by Indian Express with the image of the DR Congo; Indian express's article did not contain this picture at the time of publication of our article.
"" "Greece, 2012." "" "" ""
The riches between the riches of God?????????????!
The shocking photo you've ever seen!).
This site used the picture as evidence that Muslims were killing Nigerian Christians.
This statement has been disproved by a Greek factencheck page in 2013 and once again in 2016.
Iran, 2012.
A federation of students of theology (Mullahs) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Rohingya Muslims through the news agency Nasim and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo.
Italy, 2015.
An inhabitant of Piedicastello from Trento sent this news to his site to show his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015.
Nigeria, 2012.
Even within Nigeria, the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bombings of Boko Haram in Kano in public discussion forums.
Malaysia, 2015.
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of abusive use of the image from DR Congo, expressing sympathy towards the Nigerian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger to commit the claims that Rohingya are being persecuted, since the photos were used improperly.
Myanmar, 2017.
"" "the Myanmar government has published a definition of what they came as" "" "intentionally dark news and photos, the international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create misunderstandings with regard to Myanmar." "" "" ""
This setting, which was published exclusively in English, also includes references to fake images of smells that Hate Speech use and used by extremist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often disseminated by Burmese nationalists).
Russia, 2012. "fencer scanning puerto rico" (Christianophobia or political provocation?).
This post, addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community, makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo is not Muslims who kill Christians.
Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.
This news site falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar Ta had admitted 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.
The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still contained in it.
Spain, 2015 / 2016.
This article from 2014 on students who had been murdered by Boko Haram, published by Análisis Digital, published now, has explicitly stated that the picture does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it represents a "similar jihadist attack."
When the picture was later circulated in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.
Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world sleeps).
The image of the DR Congo dipped, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.
They wanted to reach a greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.
United States, 2015.
The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times rescued), but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context.
Instead, the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.
Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.
After a message allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums such as this in Vietnamese and declared it a false report.
The organisation of the Clarettin Missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos stood away from the embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo.
There are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.
On other accounts, aggregators and sites in the following countries (on the portfolio in Grau), TinEye also points, but are no longer completely traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.
(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps are available on the Webcrawler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)
In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original piece of 2010, the picture may ultimately have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.
Frames and pictures
There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.
The photograph was used with regard to major discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of the Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.
A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.
To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.
A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.
"" "" "" "with social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy." ""
Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and diminish the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?
The dissemination of violent images has already been comprehensively debated (for example).
One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes these images even are demanded by the victims themselves.
At the same time, the concern is that violent images sensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study examining how violent media are working on helping others).
While there is a lot to discuss about violent accounts in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.
Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which a picture suggests something which can actually be used from the context or in a completely abusive way.
However, every investigation of false attributions should also take into account how internationally it can be.

The "untranslatable" blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
Photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.
A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. unremovable) endeavours to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.
There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.
Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (e.g. the Spanish Sobremesa).
But everyone stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.
A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.
These unique words have been collected for a while in an online list.
Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.
For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's tax-clap language, such as:
"vakasteglok" - take care of your parents in recognition of how they have taken care of you in your younger years.
And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:
"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness you feel after getting warmed in the sun on cold days.
In Birds's own words from his blog about:
They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.
Sometimes, how we analyze and classify the world around us, the linguists on this site want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive are these little languages.
Speakers of the Treasure Languages, which are appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite speakers here.

How Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flooding catastrophe in the decade
The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flooding and landslide disaster in this decade.
Triggered by the monsoon, which normally employs at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya have stepped over the banks in 15 boroughs in the south and west of the country.
After an opinion of the disaster relief centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missed because of the floods and mud waves.
More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people were sent to 304 health resorts.
The rain falls on Saturday (27 May), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.
The health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.
The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:
High water in Tawalama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to the flood situation.
Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the disaster.
Sri Lanka's deadly floods are worsening the crisis of dengue, warns Save the Children, after further rainfalls are already on the way.
This morning the Neluwa bus stood in the flood, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moroda near Galle also flooded because of the water pegs of the Morogoda Ela which occurred yesterday.
The Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations, and five other five are made to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages.
Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.
Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid.
If any search and rescue teams need drones for their operations, please call 0774844639.
For those who want to donate dry food and food-necessities for flood victims -
Today we are in the area around Keleniya and Himbutana.
Please call 0777449729 or 0777843841 if you need help in this area.
The Taxi-Call-App PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks competent people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Catastophenzentrum is informed.
Last year after the tropical storm Roanu, Pickme introduced a "flood aid" button that allowed users to call a vehicle for pickup of assistance and donations. these were then relayed to the srilankische Red Cross for free.
They also introduced a "SOS" button, which resulted in more than thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by flood and landslides.
The combined efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully utilised, bring people in need of security and provide assistance.
This has prevented the loss of further human lives, whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long road to the restoration of normality.
The Muslims that one cannot see
The Women's March is January 21, 2017 in San Francisco.
Photo of Sahar Habib Ghazi.
In January I took part in the Women's March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a friend.
I entrust to her my four years old daughter; she trusted in me her children; she is my rock in the surf.
"" "" "" "in the one minute we call for slogans for women's rights." ""
In the next round, we are enforcing rights for transgender.
We are located in a sea of umbrellas and people, some hold the iconic picture of a woman with a headscarf, tied from an American flag, others scare slogans against Islamophobia.
"" "my girlfriend looks at me and says:" "" "these things do not affect you, or?" "" "why, because I am not Muslim?" "" "I ask." ""
I have already managed this conversation.
People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar who know them - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has established itself in their imagination.
They defigured me.
There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.
We don't all look alike.
We practice our religion differently.
We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different kind. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.
This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims who do not fit into it, Muslims are abducted.
To be abduced
I am not alone.
This is even done to the poet, whose poetry is most widely sold in America: Rumi.
What images do you think of if you think of him?
Love?
Peace?
As Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.
Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died.
But in the western conception, the religion of Rumis was extinguished, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.
This deleting constitutes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.
Another is in the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonizing Western books for centuries.
This enticing picture language is determined by the dark man who was to be feared and the exotic woman to be saved.
The groundbreaking Palestinian-American scientist Edward Said shattered the history behind these images in the 1970s.
But these images continue to stand out today.
Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to steer them.
I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful, flawed narratives dominate our news feeds.
This narrative overshadowed the reality of nine Muslim women in the last three decades, while the United States did not even elect their first female presidential candidate in 2016.
This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi-Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.
"" "a powerful group exercises its" "" "control" "" "on the" "" "other" "". "" ""
This strong narrative weakens Muslim women who lead movements for change.
It seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Africans who had been brought here with slave ships.
It deletes the existence of Queer Muslims.
This narrative has staffed our collective imagination so deeply and flawlessly that often Sikh men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.
Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."
To the tune of 1.7 billion
In the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts.
Or on alternative facts.
We also create narratives that help us to understand the world.
And my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion.
"" "and we have failed here, where seven million Muslims account for the" "" "diverse" "" "religious group in America." ""
More than a third of the population of the Muslim population are African-Americans.
Six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries.
The author of the author in 1976 in New York.
Use approved.
Four decades ago, my immigrated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream.
My mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim, American Statiker of Bangladesh with the name Fazlur Rahman Khan.
Back then, when Khan was thinking of the skylines of the world, my parents were tired Muslims and Americans.
But am I now defenseless Muslims and Americans?
Sometimes when people ask me why I don't eat pork, I say - instead of extracting my Muslim recipes or my handy handkerchief that all Muslims carry with themselves - "out of respect for Peppah Wutz."
I jester, we don't carry all bags of bags with us.
We also don't have to be theological experts to be "Muslim" or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport.
There are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars, Muslim activists and interreligious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam.
These lies are produced by a well-lubricated Islamist skill machine with lenders, think tanks and experts for misinformation, which have manipulated our already flawed picture of what a Muslim is, or what Islam is.
Because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia exists in more than a stranger, who tears a woman's head scarf.
Or as the startling map of attacks on mosques across the U.S., see below.
Screenshot of the ACLU website.
Islamophobia in its ugly forms attacks our affiliation.
It attacks our identity, which is so far-reaching, so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer.
The author in 1986 in a photo of her group of children.
Use approved.
I would like to explain that.
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old in a temporary mosque in the basement of a presbyterian church in New York.
When social scientists describe religious life, they refer to the following terms: faith, behaviour and affiliation.
My Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible, but they are there.
Perhaps my girlfriend, my neighbour, would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses.
She would see the ever-nightly ritual with my daughter if I were silent in my arms and whispering the Arabic verses for protection that seal the Qur'an and be called the Quls.
Each of them I repeat three times.
I ask that it is protected from evil, the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see.
My Muslim faith may not always be visible, but my Muslim affiliation is always part of my shadow.
The grandmother of the author, when she wins an Ikebana contest in Karachi, poses with her sisters sometime in the 1960s.
Use approved.
Belonging to my grandmother is on the maternal side with her sisters; as she has been winning a contest of art of flower arrangement in Karachi for decades.
It is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes: nano, surrounded by its finished and incomplete paintings of painted Sufi saints; and a Qur'an with many bookmarks, a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters, which it can virtually memorize.
To be Muslim means speaking the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day.
To be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God: Allah Mian, what God means, my only Lord.
For a people that - for centuries - became colonized by an "Empire" which has founded a company with the name honorable British Ostinidien-Kompanie, it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord.
The author in 1987 with her grandfather.
Use approved.
Belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not weep but at the same time see that my immigrant grandfather cries.
In the meantime, while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of Kashmir, Nana Jaan was weeping for his family in India ruled by Kashmir, family whom he could not close in half a century.
Affiliation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians, whose families, like my grandfather, have been torn apart by colonialists who have divided the Muslim world as in the game risk.
To be Muslim means knowing that over the last two centuries, Europeans have colonized up to four Muslim countries.
It means knowing that the first aerial bombardment of history was thrown down over a Muslim country a century ago.
It means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother, an Indian, kashmir undertan of the British empire, was referred to as "dangerous" by the newspapers of his time, as he led the first mosque in England.
Before there were planes, he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love, peace and social justice.
The Word of Islam.

To my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion belong deeply into our unforgettable family trees; our unacknowledged history.
It means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world, with troops distributed across every continent apart from the Antarctic, went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist.
It means knowing that more than half a million Iraqis are buried under the rubble of the war.
Being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veterans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001.
It means knowing that when a tragedy threatens the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name, history is reported four times more than a story with a white assassin.
It means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first cry of prayer, the Azaan, was called by a liberated black slave called Bilal.
It means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic scholar named Bilali Muhammad was enslaved and brought to this country.
It means Malcolm X is an American hero.
It is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban.
It is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black lives count.
Being an American, a Pakistani, a Kashmiri, a Punjabi, a Punjabi, a Muslim and a journalist is the inherent intersectionality of our identities with multiple hyphens, but to fail to communicate them to others.
The narrative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube, but is represented in the reducing branch "we" against "it."
Being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children, knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this branch establish structural Islamophobia.
Structural Islamophobia exists in the Muslim registries that began with President Bush and extended to President Obama.
It consists of continuous monitoring of mosques.
It consists in the immigration officer who takes a five-year-old child in handcuffs.
It is in a country that precludes its borders with people from just the countries that are being bombarded.
"" "it is a false and nebulous" "" "no-fly list" "", "which largely targeted Arabs and Muslims." ""
It is the wars that we carry and the bombs that we reject on Muslim lands.
Because of the stories we tell and because of those we don't tell, we are here today.
In a study entitled Ascent of Man, scientists from Northwestern University showed a scientifically inaccurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution.
Muslims received the lowest score.
The conversations that we have to lead
"" "we are too deep to enthuse the Muslim or the" "" "other" "". "" ""
We are back decades back to recognise the roots of our fears and the erroneous and dangerous imagery we perpetuate in our news articles.
At least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry, trying to capture our multiple identities and forgotten history.
The podcast lake Something, Say Something of Buzzante; the podcast # GoodMuslimBadMuslim; Sapelo Square on black, American Muslims; Simon & amp; Schuster Salam Reads, an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Marvel, the PAKISTANISCH, Muslim, American superheroine - all this makes me hope.
Screenshots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and intersectionality of Muslim American life.
Collage of the author.
But I am concerned about this difficult global time in which we are.
And this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion.
There is one reason why conspiracy theorists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet have now led the White House.
"" "they have grown exponentially, because they have made Muslims" "" "others" "". "" ""
There is another group that has grown exponentially by creating the "other."
A few years earlier, it had not yet existed; now they dominate major areas in Syria and Iraq.
I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now, but who made me an unbound Muslim today.
Things I left here like a breadcrumb lane in my speech.
Things that perhaps arouse memories, for in all the intersections that constitute our humanity, a story may sound where someone is being made to another.
Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley, conversations will take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islamophobia.
More than a hundred academics speak about our problems with the "other," "structural racism" and "American militarism."
But these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers.
Poster of the Facebook page of the Islamophobia Studies Network.
We all have to ask ourselves why?
Why do I tell you here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and humanized by the creation of the "other" in the public performance, was even a scientist of Stanford four decades ago.
We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and unconsciously the "other"; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president who feeds chocolate cake, while he already bombarded countries and "to other" man-made "people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion.
It starts here with all of us.
Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban diversity
Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.
Can there be any way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?
For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.
Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the invaluable blog.
Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and honor the diversity of languages of large cities.
In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.
For the creators of the project:
The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong to.
"" "while listening to" "" "listening" "" "often means" "" "to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listening, to appreciate, to make sense." "" "" ""
In this format storytellers insert their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.
Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and presentation lead to the audience getting involved.
They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.
The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassiduou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art typical for her country.
In another event, John Nyamikara tells the tale of the Rabbit and the Baboon in the Shona language:
After explaining the importance of his fables, John Nyeffara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:
You have listened!
They were alert...
They were all with me!
So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend it. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling presentations.
Puerto Rico claims to reestablish public debt from the United States
With the aim of a re-examination of the public debts of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march launched at the capitol Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.
It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the neural exam of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Rico.
The advocates of retaining debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.
This is their requirement:
The people of Puerto Rico require that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accountable for their corruption.
"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed remuneration paid to our working conditions, which acts in favour of the economy." ""
We are pressed and suppressed.
The people of Puerto Rico are refusing to pay a debt that is not theirs.
We will not choose between education and health.
Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with declining pension payments.
We demand immediate action.
The island - not integrated into the national sovereignty of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.
Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-profit non-profit organization without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority.
These are their reasons:
"" "" "" "the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure." ""
"" "" "" "without the participation and conviction of the citizens, measures imposed from the outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people." ""
"" "the demonstration was called" "" "Night Guard for Light and Truth." "" "" ""
Here are some impressions:
Protesters are preparing for the march.

Artists and Writers appreciate the work of the missing Syrian developer Bassel Safadi
Bassel Safadi and his wife Noura.
Photo from the Facebook page of Noura Ghazi Safadi.
The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missed for over a year.
But he is not forgotten.
More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network.
At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, hosted in Berlin, an event hosted by the # FreeBassel campaign.
Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).
The book, published last year and is available free of charge, contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.
It is a homage to Bassel and his work.
In the introduction it means:
This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what is the real cost with which this is connected.
Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.
This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.
His name was taken out of the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.
Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.
The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.
Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us begin thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.
Why are we here today?
What have we decided for?
What have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?
The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.
In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.
"" "his wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police had taken Bassel on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military tribunal in his cell in Adra." "" "" ""
Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented himself as the insider of the Assad administration and who were informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband.
But his whereabouts remain unknown.
A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.
Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at present the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:
Perhaps none of the cultural prototypes was foreseeable than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.
Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of many civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merges with local traditions and Persian influences.
At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he started working, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.
This strip of strife in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.
Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project up until now.
Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:
I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.
I am overwhelmed when I call his name.
Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.
I have learned to read, write and speak English well.
He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.
Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.
He brought me the internet.
He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.
Ghazi is also the author of waiting, a rehearsal that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison.
Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.
She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.
The book is available free of charge.
Book cover from Youssef Abdali.
The book is dedicated to the public domain.
"" "here is an excerpt from the book of Nora titled" "" "It Happens" "" ":" ""
It happens every time you visit,
That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,
That I lose the mind at the moment in which we embrace,
That each of the dangers doesn't matter to me,
Each of the fences, shackles and guards
I forget the prison of the prison
And I penetrate every detail of your voice and words
Which I carry with passion with me,
When your eyes say goodbye
And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...
I return quickly to my loneliness,
To bring back all the moments,
And to weep and smile about your absence.
I convince myself that I will return soon...
On the first anniversary of the port of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:
One year passes, my soul
During the period
I am in your cage,
And you're still in the Monster's cage
The story of Basle's story is not unique in Syria.
Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).
Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of force by the regime were tortured or even executed.
By 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in prison since 2011.
The stories of many other people remain unknown.
The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.
We repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.
Mozambique: due to corruption condemning director after release again on previous post
"" "" "" "Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption case in which a government member after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state machine where corruption was committed." ""
This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants due to misappropriation of 54 million metics (about 800,000 Euros).
The money came from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose council has ruled Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.
Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on 19th April.
In accordance with the opinion of the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to refer to his old post as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.
However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action well.
In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), a local institution supporting public transparency, condemned the company's decision to recharge the director again:
"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""
What we take note is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary action against the counter-traded.
The company, however, apparently kept and instituted no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.
"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "opper" "" ":" ""
If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be an advisor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been served.
He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.
But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be re-integrated into the company he helped to harm.
Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.
Disgusting!
Bitone Viage, young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any moral authority:
Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that already insulted the state.
Cambaza fails to return to morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself on the state.
Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.
Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.
Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in jail:
Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only be remembered by the Mozambians as the first independent president, but also as sharp, incisive, and - by the way - prophetic speakers.
One of his most famous oral representations was when he firmly affirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of everything, including the fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."
Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.
"" "an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""
In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:
Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and was free.
And today the company, in which he treads up funds, sets him back under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - яαsaws (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017
Emildo Sambo from the magazine @ Verdade (to German: @ Truth) states that crime pays off in Mozambique:
In fact, to be in # Mozambique thief and servant of # Frelimo pays off. # Diodino Cambaza, sentenced to long life imprisonment, returns to # airports of Mozambique - Emildo Sambo (@ EmildoSambo) May 11, 2017
Facebook blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users
"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means" "" "chickpeas" "" "or" "" "splitting blower" "". "" ""

According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.
Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."
Facebook censuses the word "Kalar" or, for all, allways (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.
In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.
In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.
But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.
"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically produce hate speech." ""
The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored in order to express their use.
In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.
For example, it is written in Burmese 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'kalar pae' (splitting bse), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).
The Facebookier Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:
A post of one of my friends was extinguished today because he contained the word Kalar.
But he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.
The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different.
There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.
Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook needs to be more analytic before breaking all the posts that were suspected of being racism.
Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.
It filters the word automatically.
Automatism will not understand what you write on faceook.
What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words.
For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "kalar pae" (splits).
The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech are getting a fairly good lesson.
Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.
While the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.
The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.
The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to share his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:
... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.
Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to pay, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "didn't comply with the Facebook community standards."
Facebook has removed many posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:
Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.
In the post, the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.
Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:
Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work like that.
Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.
In addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like "chair" or "inheritance curry."
Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely resolved posts.
If they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.
Facebook's automatic censorship caused a lot of mockery among users.
Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.
Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech but were nevertheless removed:
Used with permission.
Burmese Text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.
"" "just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar." "" "" ""
Screenshot used with permission.
"" "the post states" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""
Screenshot used with permission.
In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.
Among other things, hate speech in social networks is said to increase violence in communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where clashes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.
Facebook has been criticised for its failure to take control of the usurious hate speech on its Burmese sites.
But instead of simply censoring the word 'kalar' it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code-concentrating initiatives and learn from them.
In Trinidad and # 038; Tobago is at the end with the toe
A wedding ring in the sand.

The toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.
On 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously approved a law to prohibit this practice, so that the age-bearing age is now 18.
Before this change of marriage, some members held in practice Hindu and Muslim religious communities, and in May 2016, brother Harryperch Maharaj, leader of the Interreligious Organisation (IRO), said that the State should not interfere since that, age does not determine maturity. "
"" "this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN children's rights convention, the minors as," "" "defined by everyone under 18 years of age." "" "" ""
Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children that have already been married to 15, in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.
In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 young were married to 19 in 1997-2007.
Online petitions and social media moves that were trying to abolish laws on toe, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome.
However, not everything went smoothly.
"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the childrens" "" "toe" "", "they should, damn themselves look after their own affairs." "" "" ""
This kind of religious opposition caused tension in this really uncomplicated affair, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the draft law at all.
But early in 2017, the bill against the childrens' marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.
"" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced." ""
One of the country's senators gave on Facebook a status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:
Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not one against it.
After it was approved in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.
The majority of the social media users were thrilled, because the laws on children's marriage were finally changed.
Lovell Francis, a Facebook member of the Ministry of Education, said:
It took too much time and unnecessary talk to disguise the core of the matter, but do you know what? the toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost any price.
While Abel Jackson thought that it took a long time to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:
Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentral - Thomas, which states:, Hervorraenden News!
The marriage network has been approved.
Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "
Torture Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about the importance of the adoption of the law:
The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.
The proposal to amend the married couple was adopted today, on June 9, 2017.
There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 were present at the vote.
All deputies who were present voted for the law.
The pediatrician is no longer legally allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.
It was a long struggle (...) # childcare label.
Many thanks to all the activists who fought it.
Congratulations.
A thank you to our deputies.
But a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.
Months ago, Maharaj proclaimed his intention to take legal action, should the law be passed, and he seems to release his promise.
While the Attorney General of Paris Al-rawi, an advocate of the law, said that it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wanted to address the subject differently.
Patricia Worrell proposed:
Rather, instead of talking about the problem that we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply talk about the fact that the state, our daughters, prevents them from being misused by large, hard-boiled men, who are opposed to them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?
Or do you think that this is not a problem?
But whether it comes to court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in different gradations, although there are laws that prohibit them.

By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
The Wikipedia page in English was presented on 18 January 2012, in contradistinction to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the United States, internationally darkened.
Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)
For more than a month, Turkey has been blocking popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.
Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.
Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resisting the blockage.
Although many technology-savvy internet users are used to using wrapping tools for blocked web pages (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.
Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia in 2008, as recently published in a published report of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular internet blockages have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.
After China, Turkey is the second best known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.
While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).
A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (thus machine calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.
The content is noteworthy, despite legal prohibition.
In a blogpost, IPFS talks about his efforts:
After we heard the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we tried everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents in decentralized and distributed ways.
This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.
IPFS also stated that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.
However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.
Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar irrorsites, when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.
Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as employees at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:
It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.
One accesses to a different URL that is not the original. that which one can see is from Wikipedia.
Essentially, the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey.
For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.
A Nepalese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
A suhlense rhino, chitwan.
Photo by Sagar Giri.
Used with permission.
Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colors.
This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.
At that time he was still a child.
Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage.
And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.
He described Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:
I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!
I just rested at home when suddenly in Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.
The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.
Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.
My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to crunch pictures!!
Sagar aims to co-operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.
And he should know [it], for he was standing before [him] face to face,
A tiger cannot be disturbed by the sheep's opinion in sleeping!!
Late in the evening. the light is too weak.
Bedtime for all animals and birds.
Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!
To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.
But his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.
He waited for 22 days, mostly staying in a tent to shoot at the Bardia National Park footage of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.
See some of these photos below.

Years after the wedding Indian women dare to speak the name of their husbands for the first time
Women in the small Indian village Gumla Jam Gayi in Jharkhand.

This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.
A revised version has been republished here as part of a content sharing agreement.
In many parts of India, women avoid the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.
Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."
From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of social pressure, they must respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, get this practice alive.
Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted by an Indian state, Odisha, and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married kin with a name.
The tradition of naming their wives by name is also widespread among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all those, they should not follow this practice.
In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and quickly became the main topic of the city.
It is a place for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.
As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the Video Volunteers community and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.
"" "" "" "Rohini Pac has been working with her video camera for seven years at the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS-infected individuals, and manages these clubs." ""
She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.
The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who do not name their husbands by their names.
She chose this issue because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem that women can easily identify with.
Not speaking out loud for the names of their husbands is a custom that they are dutiful and never questioned.
Rohini means:
This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.
A woman who does not stop this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.
The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.
"" "at the beginning," "" "Rohini" "", "who has never named her husband by name, wanted to try at home as it is." ""
She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in-law.
Rohini tells us:
My mother-in-law and my husband stayed for a long time after the video was over.
"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name." "" "" ""
With this confidence in his luggage, Rohini launched her first discussion club.
Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.
At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.
After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.
Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.
"" "then she asked all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?" ""
"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""
"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the names of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paste from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women can never speak the name of their husbands.
Rohini tells us:
A woman was so shy that she only giggle before himself during the whole exercise; another decided to let out the entire frustration of him and his family by cursing him.
The expression on their faces was ecstatic.
I think I will never forget it again.
Still in adrenalin rush to have broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands by name.
And they kept their word.
In the next few days, Rohini received a number of reports.
The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop telling his name.
Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.
When her mother-in-law gazed at her she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.
"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""
A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in force.
Rohini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead, which indicates the status of the Ehestatus:
Why only women have to show that they are married?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred point if he did it too.
He laughed and I stopped bearing him.
The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.
For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.
"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." ""
Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.
"" "I don't want the women to worry about who can hear what," "" "she says." ""
For the first time in their life they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought before.
Rohini says:
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husbands.
It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.
In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.
Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.
For most of them it's okay, but some wanted to wear a saline-cta, a wide shirt over a pair of pants; they did not trust themselves.
After much argument and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes, morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.
Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.
On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:
So far we have only made small steps.
Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped talking to her husband's name.
Some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.
Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads.
The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viola for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate stream.
By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.
How Rohini declares:
Each one of us is a sacrifice of the patriarchate.
I am it too.
But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.
And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.
We are all sitting in the same boat.

The first visit of the popular band The Beatles is celebrated with a commemorative day
The Beatles at their landing in Japan.
Screenshot of the official Beatles YouTube channel.
On June 29th of this year, the hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memoirs and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.
The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.
The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noticed during the 50th anniversary of the first visit:
For just barely five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.
The people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.
Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.
The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.
Good morning! today is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan. for the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo.
Even today, songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools.
The kitsch of the Beatles just survives everything.
Today is the Beatles Memorial Day.
We all love the Beatles in our house.
I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll would represent John Lennon or not.
And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places connected with the band.
"" "" "" "if you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit." ""
1) Abbey Road
2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)
3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial Site in New York)
4) Penny Lane
5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool
The pilgrimages can sometimes not be quirky enough:
Good morning together.
Today is the Beatles Memorial Day.
Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.
The characters from the movie K-On! made a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road.
We did the same last year.
And of course, some companies use the fan base in terms of market conditions, such as this Ramen shop (cyclamen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.
Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! today is the Beatles Memorial Day.
And what could that be for a day?
"" "I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "today and eat the Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya." ""
This is how the day is going to run.
So, we hope you are there!

Bald men will be dragged and killed in Mozambique
The Zambézia police warned the people that bald men could be target of attacks in Mozambique.

A new system of abduction of bald-headed persons for organ trading, presumably for superstitious purposes, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.
At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Millet, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.
One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs were taken.
Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.
There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, said the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC.
It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men have been registered in Mozambique.
Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.
This led to the fact that the UN in 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.
The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government has developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.
Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.
He warned those who are going to travel to the country:
Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique, bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritualistic attacks, warned the Mozambican police according to the latest murder of three bald men due to their body parts.
Two suspects were arrested in the district of Millet, where the killings took place.
Hushed Algy Adamo, student and inhabitant of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said the local police were already following the case:
PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.
The persecution and assassination of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, this also draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in mind (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.
In recent days, three men with hair fallout problems have been murdered in this part of the country.
Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty which Mozambique faces:
I MÖCHTE GERNE EIN Mozambique, THE SI am ashamed of a country in which the teachers would be ashamed to demand sex against good marks, and to take sex against good marks, work and other benefits, a nation in which people would not hurt human activities or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or "black magic" are pursued.
Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunities for macabre humour could not be missed.

We are deeply affected by the death of our friend, Bassel Khartabil.
We mourn for him and speak our heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and all those who have known him and loved him.
A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria, active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel Khartabil (also known as Bassel Safadi) has a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge.
He was a close friend of many from the Global Voices community and participated in our meeting in 2009.
In November 2015, Basle's wife Noura Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people who claimed to be inside the Assad government.
They reported that their husband was sentenced to death but did not give any further information.
His stay and the Constitution were unknown until today (01 August 2017) when Noura was informed of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015.
Today and in the future, we are doing all the work of Bassel as a pioneer of the open web movement.
And we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations that have been committed to their release in the last five years.
Since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, thus the organization Syrian Network for Human Rights.
Countless of those arrested or forcibly disappeared from the regime are subjected to torture and even execution.
Between 2011 and 2016, no less than 17.723 Syrians have died in custody, the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.
The fate of many people remains unknown.

Free Bassel: Netizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize winners and dissident Liu Xiaobo
A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.
This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 to Hong Kong Free Press.
The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.
The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.
In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (endangering the state) after he had participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto called for the democratic reforms in China.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as "an internal affair," and a spokesman tells us that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."
However, China still maintains calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to permit him treatment abroad.
While some countries have criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.
Hong Kong Free Press has summarised several reactions from abroad.
United Nations Educational Talks
Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.
However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu a treatment abroad.
Norway and the world
Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brenden refused to answer questions about Liu's release.
The relationship between China and Norway came to shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government made it clear that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.
Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.
After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.
Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.
During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.
European Union - European Union
On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.
The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as she announced in a statement on 30 June:
At the same time, we expect China to elevate all limitations of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.
They should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.
United States of America
Us ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans "wish him that he has the possibility of treating abroad in so far as he can help him in his recovery."
A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the embassy asks the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.
"" "the US embassy requested an angry response from China, with the Foreign Ministry statement that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""
Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:
"" "" "" "protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice on which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations." ""
The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.
I urge China to release the Nobel prize winner # LiuXiaobo unconditionally so that he can embark on proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo
Germany and the Netherlands
"" "German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hopes" "" "all the medical support he needs" "" "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "" "" "" "
Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.
Previously, diplomatic sources were reported in Beijing by the news agency Reuters, that China had great concerns whether the vortex of Liu might overshadow the visit to Hamburg.
Canada - Canada
On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to worry about his family.
Liu Advocate told AFP that Liu's wife Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.
McCallum continues to say:
"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression and freedom of expression." ""
France - France
In a statement on 29 June, France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:
All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.
Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually take it up.
Taiwan Museum and Taiwan
The Council of the Festival Affairs in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Liu and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.
The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.
Dalai Lama
The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in a statement on June 28 about Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius Well being.
He said about Liu:
It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which would have contributed to a more peaceful world.
I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.
Singapore: city or country?

Is Singapore a city or country?
The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.
But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city.
This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.
During the meeting of the International branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore to other countries.
He supports Singapore as a city to be considered.
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...
This is what most people commit a mistake.
I have tried to explain that we are different.
We are a city.
We are not a country.
The Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice of "turning the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.
And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.
It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from those responsible, a breach of duty.
Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?
The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries," in view of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.
On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.
These cities are democratic.
As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old Lyre comes up from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the distorted logic, since it fits better to their power.
In the end, during the last week of Shanmugam, answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-replies.
He disguised relevant questions with non-answers in a rational manner.
Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.
If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...
In short, I don't understand anything.
I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.
By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.
Read the transcript.
"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""
He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).
"" "when he said," "" "Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""
Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemical statement.
I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...
At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.
But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this, associates right and aware of what he is defending.
The TEMASEK Review breaks down the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:
Did Herr Shanmugam have committed a mistake or was it a Freudian Speaker?
If Singapore is not a country, we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state?
If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?
Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.
Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance.
Why do the Singaporeans afford their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?
Who must pay back our Prime Minister?
What is the value of our pink identity card?
Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?
"" "" "" "Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore, the magazine" "" "Journey of a Decade" "" "has always been a city:" ""
"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""
This sentence seems to have been annoyed by many Singaporeans...
No one ever said that Singapore is a country.
We were always a city.
We have always been a city / island state.
"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "defending the country" "", "but this is not quite true." ""
We should rather talk about the defense of the city.
The myth of the "nice Canadian"
The Canadian Ned Flanders.
Screenshot from a YouTube video.
Global Voices recently asked his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or homeland?
Their answers are published here as part of a continuous series, with which rumors about certain parts of the world are exposed and another facet is to be shown.
The latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan who lives in Canada and Japan.
"" "the question that is most asked for in Japan is:" "" "are you Americans?" "" "" ""
"no, sorry," I reply. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I have been living there and back in Japan.
Depending on which situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.
My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice hockey, Nature." many Canadians might be wary of anger if they are held for Americans, but I don't bother about that.
For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.
This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.
All beloved Canadians.
Americans, on the other hand,....
So it was already when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.
Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.
We have a free healthcare!
There are no weapons with us!
Gay marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!
Everyone seems to think Canada is so great.
We are polite.
"" "we obviously often say" "" "sorry." "" "" ""
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.
We are not as these guys south of the border.
We Canadians are nice.
I hate that.
First of all, I have many American friends I admire very much.
It wouldn't matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas, for example.
With Marc from Austin.
With Adam from San Francisco.
Or with Michael from Honolulu.
"" "but there are also some issues with the stamp" "" "nice" "". "" ""
First, to be called "nice" is basically to be philistine - like the benevolent, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has a Canadian Doppelgänger).
If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.
There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.
To be harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and not to pay attention.
This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that happen around you.
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians.
We tend to take care of our own affairs only.
"" "what outsiders call" "" "nice" "" "is perhaps just chilly politeness." ""
Canadians don't often talk about the fence along with the neighbours.
We lack the warm, open kindness which I now connect with my American friends.
Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice."
Music video of a pop band parody Thailand's junta
A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video released by the Junta, which took power in 2014, and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.
The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend does.
Although not explicitly political, the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the junta.
The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.
The video of the song was a huge success.
In the first three days alone, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,254 times divided and received 8,800 Likes.
Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.
The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.
Take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.
The "44 rules of the girls" may relate to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives absolute decision-making on important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army.
"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious programme of" "" "changing the settings" "" "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people viewed by the Junta as critics." ""
The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest militants and other critics of the state.
For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosecute persons accused of leveraging the monarchy.
Thailand uses a strict law against "read Majeste" (Majestic).
On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.
Two days later it came to a coup of the army.
One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that purchasing is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.
The video shows how people are thrown into a black van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.
"" "some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy." ""
Meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band who imitated the Salut of "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014.
Life continues in ruins of ghost towns in eastern Abkhazia

The following article, written by Dmitri Stateynov, was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission.
The post-war society only recovers very slowly in East-Abkhazia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.
It has now been over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchashic war has been officially ended, but its scars are still very visible in this part of the Republic.
The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.
Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharagava are located in the coal-basins of Abkhazia.
Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, East Asia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area.
Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.
Today the majority of Russians and rabbits live in the area.
Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.
During the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns.
This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.
Since 2011, the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people, having barely risen over a decade.
In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.

The empty five-storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s, known as chukchkovite, symbolize the decline and devastation of the region.
The buildings are in decay and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families.

At the entrance of the village Dzhantukha I met a native elderly man.
He starts a conversation and it is hard for him to finish it.
"" "" "" "all this is a consequence of war." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "can I talk to you?" "" "why talk?" ""
"" "nevertheless it is clear." "" "" ""
Before the war, the village was full of life.
There were community centres, schools and kindergartens that served all of the community.
Now there is only paved road with faded glory buildings.
The people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district.
About fifty inhabitants live in Dzhantukha ghost town.
About 38 people live in Akarmara, in other villages it looks similar.
The Khrushchowkas, which still house one or two families, can be seen on the balconies, where laundry is dried.
Two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house.
When they discover me with the camera in my hand, they pull back immediately.
"" "" "" "our mother has forbidden us to be photographed," "" "says one of the girls." ""
"" "" "" "why?" "" "it simply forbidden us, that's all." "" "" ""
The girl is whispering something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and vanishes.
Many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called Tkuarchalugol.
Families are also involved in the subsistence economy (cultivation of agricultural products for personal use) such as cattle breeding, beekeeping and vegetable cultivation.
It is difficult to get over the laps.
In winter, the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages.

Galina doesn't want to receive financial help from her daughter and insists that she supports her young grandchildren instead.
Galina's monthly pension is just nine dollars.

Aunt Galya tells that they and other villagers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together.

She has lived in her house for some time together with her husband and the five common children.

Every day she recalls the village life before the war.

Her husband works in the carbon pit.
The young family has their own farm.
Near the house where Natasha's kindergarten was once located, they keep pigs, cows, cocks and chickens.
She tells us that it was a very frightening situation at first when many people left the village after the war.
But over time, it lost its anxiety.

When our conversation comes to an end, a little boy runs past us.
It runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself.
A ball flies out of the window and another boy chases him afterwards.
He plays with the ball rolling down the hill.

While they are running, some of them throw rocks on the ruined buildings.

In Mexico, "Mama Africa" houses migrants on their long journey
Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border from Mexico to Guatemala.

This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission.
"" "" "" "on the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality." ""
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is on the border to Guatemala.
It is a very simple hotel near the city center.
It is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured ear rings in teddy bear-form.
It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.
This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.
The hotel has no charm.
For about $2.50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.
In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.
There is no sign for the hotel - there are still hundreds of African and Haitian migrants coming here.
Sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, people come to the full little busses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!
Where are you mummy Africa?. "
At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.
There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard.
She doesn't want to refuse anybody.
She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, they buy them medication, which they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.
Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.
The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Mercalli, who has a moustache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.
The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to be able to go to Boston.
Photo: Amy Bracken.
"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel it fits her, as African women are very nice women." ""
Very loving.
She has the warmth of a mother...
We feel very comfortable here. "
Sebastiao travels with his sister hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.
They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to normally make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.
The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.
He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Ms Ramírez.
As many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.
When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.
He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money necessary to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.
"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he responds with a smile." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""
MS Ramírez recounts that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey.
She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.
She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.
MS Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.
At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.
This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house.
He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive.
He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night.
At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.
Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.
Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.
"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.
"" "there are places where people will help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""
After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.
The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.
José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.
In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single traveller, offered him her roof.
A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go.
Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is again full of guests.
In the aisles, the travellers consult their telephones quietly.
A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.
MS Ramírez appears happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.
Like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with numerous photos.
There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.
She laughs sadly as she introduces herself to me.

China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.
A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.
The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.
On July 10, mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi were given a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").
"" "in the communication it is said that the app" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""
However, the authorities could also use the app to fight terrorism for more than ever.
According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged news with a private weavchat group.
The police said that the app would identify and track down the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.
Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:
Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.
The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.
This app with minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.
An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.
For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.
This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.
While reports about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often bleak for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.
In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.
The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (as well), the censored news published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen accidentally checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the surveillance app.
The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.
A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.
If you are being discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.
This is a setback for technological development.
They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.
This is a form of captivity by the rest wax technology.
We are back in Maos China.
"images from mainland China" (BTW.) also released a Jingwang product description from which it emerges that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.
After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.
The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.
All government branches, authorities and institutions affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.
A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:
In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a decree with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.
The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a whole series of other possible crime rates, including those related to peaceful religious or political messages.
Sleep or death, part 1: all screams after death

"" "this is the first of six reports in the series" "" "sleep or death" "" "in which activist Sarmad Al Jilane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison." ""
Far from our blue, virtual world you are looking at and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing.
Everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable, both from the inside and from the outside.
One that gives honour to their name.
One who has settled down in a list of feelings and phrases that do not allow metaphors.
But when the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into being flesh and blood, and everything screams after death.
All doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence, even when the earth is spinning on the axis of evil. it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone.
They tried me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to learn "my lesson," as the chief of security trusts formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.
He demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.
Five young people were torn down during a peaceful protest as weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.
"" "it was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with" "" "Allahu Akbar" "". "" ""
All the neighborhoods were coveted, but my own not.
For the first time, it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I did not set high demands on a city that is stuffed into the arteries with government security organisms and their accomplices.
In the third night things had calmed down somewhat after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood.
"" "I broke the silence by shouting" "" "Allahu Akbar" "" "several times from my house roof." ""
I heard my voice resisted by silence.
A few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.
I was not alone.
Many friends, true friends joined me; we allied to a magnificent picture that fully fulfilled my expectations.
In such a moment, you are aware that you liberate the mind from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least.
"" "I received a call from my father:" "" "get ready, we meet at the Military Security Building." "" "" ""
He laid up.
Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you could swallow - nothing can give you your voice after you screamed it all the way up to the office of security service out of the body.
I arrived there.
The Colonel Ghassan was standing there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I am now.
The Colonel Ghassan starts speaking: "let me hear how you write" Allahu Akbar, "or you are only brave enough to scream when we're not nearby."
His fiercely-filled eyes focused on me.
"" "" "" "and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground!" "" "" ""
What I did then has nothing to do with courage.
I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building.
Perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution.
"" "I was so sure of my case when I replied," "" "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday." ""
"" "and I think I never stopped gazing at you, so why should I do it now?" "" "" ""
It was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said.
"" "" "" "put him in solitary confinement and his father alike." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "his father is right with it." "" "" ""
The stench of this cursed proposition lies in my nose until today.
"" "he became a" "" "syndrome" "", "a mental torture I was subjected to for months." ""
I went through the courtyard.
In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.
Then back through the courtyard and into the second office which leads through a corridor to the individual cells.
I took care of all the details before I enter the room.
In contrast to what else they have allocated a larger cell to me this time.
I have to share them with only one single prisoner and I am allowed to put them immediately without waiting for their permission.
After a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the police left the cell, and I reached an old-tried communication method: beating against the wall with the fist.
"" "I learned that my cell comrade was a" "" "first-convicted" "". "" ""
After a long hesitation he finally answered me.
"" "apparently, none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle-aged man, who looks similar to me and called" "" "the Doctor" "". "" ""
In the complete darkness, no markings can be seen on me, and doctors do not exist here; we are all only numbers.
"" "" "" "maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine?" "" "" ""
All the answers deny his existence.
Perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells.
Perhaps he will stop immediately.
The investigator had assured me that they would release him if I remain.
Of all the liars.
I would have liked to have had a scarecrow in order to remove all these crows, which are labelled with the fruits in the garden of my head.
From afar, I still hear them shout "Allahu Akbar."
It must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cries, every day.
The door opens.
I was always convinced that black is the colour of perdition until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror in person: the Raad (e.g.: "thunder," allusion to the 13th Sure of the Koran).
"" "" "" "they are here to be heard." "" "" ""
Thus the secret was revealed: to protect the state security from us and prevent us from exposing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their sectarian blackmail and betrayed the narrow field of view of their view of the world.
This is not a house, this is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to turn the criminal of their clans into a hero.
I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man.
"" "he starts a" "" "pleasant" "" "conversation, despite the facial expressions that derail him:" "" "my boy, you are still young, you can do so much more important with your life than to join those Tagedieben and to protest on demonstrations that will soon end anyway." "" "" ""
I did not answer.
I got used to not responding.
I can't say exactly when insults and punches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me.
When and how this happened was unimportant.
Some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I did not have done anything to deserve this punishment.
On penalty in all its diversity.
His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.
He calls the affectionate "confession."
It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloak.
Your executioner rejoices in your cry.
Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cries.
My screams were not enough for him, so they exchanged the tube through a cable.
At my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator used to work as a refuse collector or if it belonged to the normal work equipment.
They had intertwined four cables to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.
Within a single hour three of them switched off while I was still in the row.
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I ceased to scream.
The executioner noticed the cooling and didn't like it, which is why he went next to an electrically charged rod.
Electricity flowed my whole body enough to supply my entire neighborhood.
My semi-naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor.
The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.
After two horrible hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.
This must have been around midnight.
I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.
Some hours passed which occurred to me like minutes.
Then the call to the morning prayer.
"" "the door opens and the morning light fulfils the space." "" "Raus mit dir, Arschfecker" "". "" ""
"" "I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "" "my Lord, my Father must be fearful." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "be quiet and keep away, you'll be laid." "" "" ""
That was new.
Otherwise they always released me.
Where do they lead me?!
The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition
Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.
The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.
Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he shuffles to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and then back to his couch.
But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.
He lives in the highest floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as feluyees (about: farmers).
For six years now Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.
With his music, which often deals with topics like orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are relevant not only in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.
At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking and, according to his own statement, can sympathize with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.
Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special tendency towards American foreign policy.
Hdaib views his art in his studio in Amman.
Recorded by the author.
Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before.
"I don't think so because of my own circumstances," says Hdaib.
"" "then he added:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he shook water in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""
The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.
Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot day's day has little to do with protest against Islam.
Basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.
"" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries." ""
Therefore, it is easy to do basic things like drinking water in the public during the Ramadan, not to land in prison.
Recently the Ministry of the Interior Jordaniens announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.
Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the corporate statement.
The MPs and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of the scary's sexual orientation.
Many also claim that the engagement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism which will question the old-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.
In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to choose "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."
This statement might not be simple rhetoric, but actually reflects an ever-growing reality in Jordan, which clearly manifests itself in Hdaibs's work.
In 2016, Hdaib promoted traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.
The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs extend up to the corners of the canvas.
It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.
In the last few years, the number of 'Honorary-mordes' has been accepted in Jordan - the unofficial externally left.
According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary positions reached its peak in 2016; however, it is further aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.
According to a law on the fight against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be kept in prison indefinitely," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee of the family are often necessary that the woman will not do anything.
Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects which in his country long considered taboo.
Hdaib denies that his work is political, but concedes that he cannot divorce his music, which is full of explicit promises of sexuality, freedom and expression.
"" "" "" "I come out of the Middle East, man." ""
"" "politics has been tricked," "" "he says." ""
In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity.
"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""
The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.
In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."
In this song repeating a verse often repeats:
"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""
In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which you, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.
He notes that barely anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.
In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember later that his comments were torn, twisted and his opinion had been censored.
"" "" "" "it was uploaded on Youtube without cuts, but streamed only a edited version," "" "he says." ""
Today, Hdaib openly advocates the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.
He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.
Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who later was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?
The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.
In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.
Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, arguing that they had voiced criticism on social media commentaries on issues linked to deep-rooted corruption.
In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.
For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, reasoned and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.
Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.
He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing them."
Perhaps the region is approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced cracies. at least, he hopes that.
Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and resist.

Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.
These big, extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!
There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta festival.
One assumes that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory states that the fortresses, the drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years, and from a time in which armies from west Japan moved to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi to the knees.
We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.
We were able to pick some great seats, so we have a great view.
One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...
A community centre in the capital city, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.
I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.
Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:
"Yattemare!
Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.
I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.
The sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible.
Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!
Young Peruvians exchange arms against shears and razors

Seldom outward appearances and body care were so important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate occupation like the hairstyle.
El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.
A survey published in April 2017 revealed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.
At the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, experiences rising demand for esthetic services for men.
The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles by famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more normal citizens entering the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.
The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," held since 2014.
Experts will compete against each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).
Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and receive training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work.
Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.
The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes:
In 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.
Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters
Photo: Valentina Monsalve.
Use with kind permission.
"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine" "" "Tea After Twelve" "". "" ""
The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.
Why do we only write love letters to people we know?
Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled, to accommodate affection?
This is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la cumliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.
Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: Revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.
The signing of the Peace Treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.
However, before the Colombians there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.
Guerrillas, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a rhetoric of war, and around the clock had their weapons in their hands, now have to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.
The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.
Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help with the integration process.
And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.
The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every guerrilla fighter who is to be handed over personally.
Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign
The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.
He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.
He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most of them.
So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC soldiers who will now find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace."
To date, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.
The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.
'I would never have thought that someone would forgive me '
The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19th.
A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters in person.
The members of the FARC acted as they had done before to receive orders from their leaders.
But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people all over the country.
It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness and all that lies in between," said Manuela Jiménez Avila, political science student.
Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:
After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.
When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed lay a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Palace.
"" "I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""
It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.
"" "" "" "never in my life has someone written such a beautiful thing to me, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran on me over the cheeks." ""
I hugged him completely and placed me beside the pomegranates.
Perhaps he was sorry for the war too, it was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.
The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.
But now I know there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms.
Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.
"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""
New voices and voices
At the outset, students and some FARC leaders joined a discussion round.
The students were all raised up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.
That is why the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has worked out on the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.
"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""
Manuela was impressed:
Hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and recognizing that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.
The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.
But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.
Many former fighters have responded to the letters.
For example, Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Jesús Monsalve, the archbishop of the city of Cali:
"" "" "" "the Colombians have been prophesied that peace would reign after disarming." ""
But this is not the case.
As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people ready to pick up arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).
We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.
That is why we call all advocates of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.
We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.
There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.
A Transwoman talks about the persecutions in Chechnya and the life before Kadyrov
A map of Chechnya, with neighbouring autonomous regions and countries.

It follows the translation of an article written by our partner Aida Mirmacerova and whose first publication was published on the OC Media website.
Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers, including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.
With horrors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.
But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community there is not only about night.
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.
Several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya conquered the international headlines after reports were published bringing about the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.
The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities that arrested suspected queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.
"" "" "" "you have brought a monster to the world" "" "" ""
Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozy and grew up there.
Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.
When she grew up she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow.
After experiencing a group of Chechens from the sex equation of their landing, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.
She moved to the United States because of fear of her life.
Sabrina: I was a volunteer at a human rights organisation.
One day I was told that someone needed my help.
It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.
She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.
While I tried to help her, someone I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can remove this disgrace?"
After that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp.
On October 10, 2015 I was attacked.
When I was doing some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."
When I turned around I felt something in my body, but I hurt.
"" "then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still honour the family, you flock?" "" "" ""
I did not know the person.
I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.
Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital.
Apparently some women had received everything and started to scream.
The man was fled.
The women had called a ambulance.
In the hospital, I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung wing.
OOC Media: in which health wings you have been placed - in the men or the women?
Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women.
I am very grateful for that.
When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.
But he turned out to be a good person.
I am grateful to him for having respect with me respectfully.
I spent more than a month in the hospital.
Last February I got threats.
They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.
That was the beginning of a nightmare.
My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.
They demanded to send me back to Chechnya in order to prove that it was all a lie.
They ordered absurd demands: some said to me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozy and say that I didn't change my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.
I have grain size C - what should I have told on TV?
OC Media: how did your family manage to deal with this pressure?
Sabrina: it's still hard for her.
Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.
"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic." ""
"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""
My mother became too much and she lay a rope around her neck.
Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.
At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.
After it happened the third time, I realized that there was a bit lazy.
My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.
OK Media: how did you fly?
Sabrina: with the help of activists.
For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.
With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.
I can still not understand how it could be.
Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.
I bought them without registering me, without identification, without everything.
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.
Arrived and checked in at the hotel.
The number was registered to a stranger.
I inserted the SIM card into my mobile phone.
At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?
Our people already know which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.
"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""
Can you imagine that?!
This was actually my room number.
OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?
Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.
But we don't talk about the gender equality, that's a taboo topic.
I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.
As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.
I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.
When chatting with camera, I actually try to look at how the person looks at them from their past - so on my male form.
But this is very difficult.
OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?
What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?
Sabrina: I filed a report last week in Washington.
For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.
I talked to someone who has been in argun for a month and a half.
He told us that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not exclude a new wave.
Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.
This is what I mean, they probably charge relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.
OK Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?
Sabrina: a friend of mine says there's not too many.
If, then, especially those who have no rich relative or who were dropped by their relatives to make Cadyrov's judgment.
As far as I know, they are captured there so that they can later present them as terrorists.
"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked some village or a military base." ""
Do you understand?
As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.
OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?
Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for a month and a half.
He says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard has grown.
There has been nothing new from them ever since.
They simply took them along.
And this so-called Lord, that person was there even when these people were taken along.
Until now they were not presented as bandits but there were no reports about this yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.
Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?
Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?
Sabrina: I wore my hair always long.
In Chechnya I had a Bob.
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.
In earnest!
Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.
On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.
"" "Russia originally intended to introduce us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but eventually thrown us back into the Stone Age." ""
How is this possible under the Sharia law?
Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, bore tubes and short loops.
The Ministry of Defense of Sharia has never crossed my hair.
Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me.
It was a small place where several benches stood and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.
We have never been insulted.
"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""
They often say it to children when they make fun of the sick.
OK Media: so they just shut their eyes off you because they thought you were sick?
Sabrina: yes.
They have never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.
How long did this Gnadenszeit last?
Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov resigned.
When he became prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.
He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.
Nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city.
Those who had smiled and laughed at before looked at you once with suspicion.
In the meantime I left Chechnya.
But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated.
OC Media: what activity do you have now?
Sabrina: I work as a waitress.
I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.
Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.
Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.
I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.
We organise tea riffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.
I do not miss a cent for it.
I discovered these people myself when I klapperated the type of refuge.
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.
OC Media: do you wear a Hiddebug?
Sabrina: that is silly.
Nature is so, it has nothing to do with religion.
This is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to make you know with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gays with them.
"" "the Dagestanes have those who have Kabardinian which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya" "". "" ""
I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.
I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.
Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.
You know, many think of transient to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.
These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings.
For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.
Not if I have a partner or not.
Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.
And I'm not really sad because of that - I just know that I am now myself.
Local groups warn of an increase in self-murder within the impoverished Arab Ahrai community in Iran
The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.
There has been a sharp rise in suicide since the last few months.
The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.
Photo: use with permission.
The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi group in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.
Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.
He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to arise, so Ahrazi human rights groups who would like to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.
A video shared on YouTube gave the moments after he had lighted himself.
Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to Taleghani Hospital in Ahraz.
According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything.
He died shortly afterwards.
It was not the only suicide that happened in August in the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.
The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Folah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have changed.
Their stories have one thing in common: they were all fathers of the family who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on the grounds of persecution by the Iranian government.
Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination
The region, where much of the Arab Ahrazi-community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to maintain their livelihoods.
A century ago, the Arab forefather was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.
In the Ahraz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the wealthiest and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.
Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of that wealth.
It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, starvation and deprivation.
The Iranian regime systematically refuses to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.
The government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.
These dams have only managed to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm-industry.
The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youth has now increased to 81%.
Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and have 45% university degree.
"" "a" "" "systematic strategy" "" "aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""
Karim Dohihimi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist headquartered in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mix of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi-men.
"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahraz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""
Because functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities across all sectors.
This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland Ahraz.
There are people who had to change their name and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahrazi and be hired as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.
Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi has to endure, human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive.
It remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it.
The main reason for suicide is untreatable depression.
Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.

"" "" "" "why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectionalen?" "" "" ""
Detail of a photo. added by: Pixabay. published in the CC0 Creative Commons License.
The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.
You can read in the comments below the original text.
When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.
They wonder why I am not part of the movement.
They even suggest well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.
For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men despite equal education.
That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.
Violence against women is a global epidemic.
Or that cultural and social norms ensure that women sooner or later meet a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and faiths.
All of this is aware of me and well-known.
I am convinced of it and I suffer double and triple among them.
I am a black woman.
And yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination; if I mention the way we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists have been silent.
But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "raise their voices and" singing Kumbaya, my Lord "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.
But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence, which we are subjected to black women in two ways.
Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.
That black girls and girls with a migration background often are referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.
Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.
On the one hand I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, which relate both to gender and to the skin color of a person.
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.
"" "" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an unmended and marginalized being in historical terms." ""
I refuse to join groups that, through cultural appropriation, absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric program.
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin colour and gender, because some of them will continue to be silent about the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for the better.
Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word feminism is still in its name.
I prefer to fully isolate myself from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and status as a woman, rather than using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.
Now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.
Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: recall (example: Africa-Womanismus: as we recapture ourselves), we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped who make up the black woman.
Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement that affects the black woman.
In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm on account of my dark skin and on account of my being as a woman.
I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment in which my life is neither ignored nor ignored, nor rejected.
Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
This post by Todd Reubold was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems.
This article will be published once again as part of a content sharing agreement.
Again and again Nabil Musa traveled in the last 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.
In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community.
"" "" "" "I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "" "said Musa." ""
Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.
Musa is a member of the Waterkeepers Iraq non-governmental organisation - a subsidiary of Waterkeepers Alliance that is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "
At the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in one question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"
This video was produced, filmed and edited by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq.
The focus of her work lies on pursued, neglected subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, whose help suppressed municipalities can tell their stories in their own way.
Paraguayan women and their difficult fight against violence

The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" of Corpus. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin), which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay.
Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.
A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent to her.
Since the end of their relationship there was some time passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.
As another woman Balbuena pointed out because of abuse, the official display of Ada Báez also took advantage of nothing.
A few days later, the second woman returned her ad.
Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.
In general, if women reimburse ads at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.
In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women admit to be victims of violence, to report to prosecution authorities at all.
Contentment 1 Beaches and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that nothing under-dimmt3 Paraguayan laws: good base, inadequate implementation hits and statistics
It is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are different statements and reports which, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay" explains them.
The available numbers, however, are alarming.
In 2015, 9600 indicators of domestic violence were reported to the District Attorney Office. 70% of them were violence against women.
86% of the ads in police came from women.
There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women's ads came here too.
In the advertisements 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women said of psychological abuse.
However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.
"" "according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "" "on every woman reported in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women do not do that." ""
"" "at the end of 2014, there are two women who are unable to do so because of physical abuse." "" "" ""
Since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement agencies cannot properly document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.
By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.
The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.
According to her estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violent acts by men.

Invisible abuse and a judicial system that undertakes nothing
Before Mariana Brítez became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends.
In the beginning, she didn't want it, but then still gave up. this should be regrettable for ever.
Today Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.
When I read about it, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too miserable because they are fooled by violent men.
I was convinced that this would never happen to me.
Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.
Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.
Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.
Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.
It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.
Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the Paraguay authorities in order to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.
"" "Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse." ""
In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.
They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.
In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.
Her prosperous partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worthless.
Then he began beating them.
Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support.
She led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.
Paraguayan laws: good base, poor implementation
"" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied." ""
"" "the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "" "says Victoria Santos." ""
Carmen Echauri, representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.
On 10 August 2016, a bill of law was discussed at the Paraguayan Parliament which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Luxe).
This hashtag and the movement # NiunaMenos (# NonReeLess) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.
The original draft of the law stipulates that Feminid will lead to an independent criminal record and to punish the harsher as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.
Thus, the text of the law changed in some respects to also win the deputies for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions was denied, which is currently banned in Paraguay and punishable with up to five years imprisonment.
The original bill had intended to cost the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs that the victims of violence have to bear on their own, if they just want to pay a complaint and want to receive a safe accommodation to the state.
Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:
In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.
Here a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.
In view of these facts, the perpetrators are complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are offended.
We have to reimburse for such a long time until mistreatment is no longer considered normal.
On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan senate. previously, parts of the law had been modified. among other things, a passage was cancelled, which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.
Opinions on the changes go apart.
The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victims again.
"" "the cancellation of the words" "" "gender" "", "" "" "political violence" "" "and" "" "sexual harassment" "" "of parts of the law, however, is regarded as a great setback." ""
This article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" of Corpus. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin), which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay.

Independent media continues to attack attacks a year after banning a newspaper
"" "" "" "this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information" "" "is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn." ""
More than a year ago, the Venezuelan authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the sultan.
Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he is serving a one-year prison sentence.
Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and put to trial, but later released.
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having deposited his father, Said ibn Taimur, through a coup d "état.
Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he has held the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.
The sultan's rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, restricting public freedoms, including press freedom, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to intimidate and detract.
The authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists from expressing their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.
The attack on Azamn, its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.
Azamn is an independent newspaper reported since its foundation in 2007 on Corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.
On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Editor-in-Chief of Azamn, arrested after an article published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016 titled "High-ranking Parties" Hands of Justice. "this was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-ranking officials in court decisions.
In the report, government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court in Oman to suspend a verdict in an inheritance dispute.
"" "issue of the newspaper Azamn of July 26, 2016 with a report on the title page with the title:" "" "high level parties bind the hands of justice." "" "" ""

On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the Editorial Board, was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival.
On 9 August 2016, the ISS took over the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj who acted as editor-in-chief after Al-Maamaris arrest.
"" "the paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the directive that" "" "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper is prohibited on any road, including online, from 9 August 2016." "" "" ""
The trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the Court in Maskat on 26 September 2016.
The Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.
Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned by interference of the public order, "misuse of the Internet," and "undermining the state of the state."
In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and of slander.
Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines of 3,000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year ban was imposed on the two journalists.
Al-Abri was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order."
For Al-Abri, a bail was set in the amount of 5000 omanic Rial (13,000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pronouncement of the sentence.
The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari for six months in prison.
Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month jail sentence from the Central Prison in Maskat. al-Haj remains in prison, where he served his first prison sentence.
The Appeals Court also revoked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the Azamn paper.
Despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper still faces attacks by the omanic government.
On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of Azamn was extended by three months.
On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of Azamn was extended by three additional months, and with what the minister once again opposed the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again.
The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times press freedom has been violated.
Other violations include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper to stop its operation.
Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the authorities are still unwilling to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom.
The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the authorities to:
1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can follow their work;

Medical research in Africa: opportunities and misunderstandings
Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent
Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent.
There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.
Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere in the poorest countries of Africa, and lack of investment in research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.
Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.
Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for the Research of Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).
In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic showed serious consequences for national health.
He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.
As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he researched the HIV virus itself before deciding to go back home in order to support the Samba health system.
With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.
(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).
Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?
Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sambian National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.
In addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.
CC: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?
How do they differ from those in Western countries?
RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.
This has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipients instead of being themselves creators.
The solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.
CC: where does the funding and support come from?
Is it sufficient?
How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?
RW: from the USA and Europe.
The projects are promoted in different ways.
It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.
CC: what is the research infrastructure?
What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?
RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.
Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.
CC: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?
RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.
CC: how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate on, and how can we support the development?
RW: the potential is amazing.
I have seen great students of all ages.
There is a need for special scientific training, starting at any age.
Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.
CC: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?
RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.

From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production
This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.
Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.
Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outstanding Gorgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.
For almost 20 years, Morton's work has only been limited by his own imagination and the question of how many sorts of salads he can get.
But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding.
The patents are not only valid for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance to disease, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.
Over the past few years, more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or cartel varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food security are concerned about the future of food production.
As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still growing salad, but it needs to be longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions.
"" "" "" "it's like lying in a river a boulder that I have to mate." ""
"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go far too far." ""
And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented. "he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those features he wants.
However, he is very careful not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.
It has also joined a movement growing in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).
Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red roman lettuce of the "Greenhouse" variety in the "Greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.

It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.
The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.
It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.
As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.
However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seed to breed their own varieties, and not immediately cut it out - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.
Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.
Gloomy views
For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.
Seeds therefore play a role in larger contexts, such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.
Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.
All kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability," he says and takes control of increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples are the combinations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, which are being offered in farmers markets for example, should also know that the manner in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.
"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""
The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains free, as opposed to patented seed and plant features.

Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.
Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartel features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only complicit.
For other plants, such estimates are not yet available, but experts such as Luby suspect that plants that are grown naturally like wheat are still more patented than lettuce or carrots.
A question of perspective
Plants are cultivated in such a way that they have purposefully desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves as far as such, due to which they prosper in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.
Opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is far more necessary than ever since the modified conditions are much more likely to be predicted by climate change.
In an e-mail Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also vital for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.
It contradicts the view that intellectual property is in possession of other breeders as "patents and the protection of plant varietets promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.
Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.
Such protection does not prevent innovation, it encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "
Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not support innovation.
And if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.
"" "however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""
"" "" "" "we want farmers to facilitate their work." ""
"" "this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""
"" "in total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant features:" "" "we do not really create the features ourselves." ""
The plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.
A secret of nature. "
For Carol Deppes, Plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi Management Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety, also breeds its own values into it.
Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce herbicides, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.
"" "my concept is exact opposite." "" "" ""
While some medium-sized companies (such as that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they hold it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.
The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salate in his breeding garden.

Morton is also the opinion that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am stronger than companies with my efforts to produce new products.
I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition, which makes it very easy to do with my opinion. "worldwide response
"" "although the US seems to be a leader in the" "" "open source" "" "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world." ""
In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open-source" seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre collaborates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.
"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""
The German organisation Agrecol works on an "open source" license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.
(rules for breeders differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot simply be joined one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)
At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conventionally bred plants.
However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.
In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed patenting.
Willy Douma, responsible for "open source" seed systems for Hivos, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems, which should be the official start of the official launch next year.
An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.
In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report from aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others. it believes farmers have the opportunity to feed on seeds, exchange and improve seed policy and ensure stable food supply.
The report also stresses the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby from Ossi hopes that more people will soon see him.
"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food mainly focused on where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role in this," "" "said Luby." "" "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food." "" "" ""

Human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt
The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.
This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.
On the weekend around the 5th of August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above.
In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.
The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains consistent despite this attack and the mocking of Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as it is now.
It is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network originating from Qatar because of alleged "support for terrorism."
# Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of web side closures fell victim. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K
In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt anymore.
Zida used his blog for the prevalence of articles and articles that he writes for websites and media that are inaccessible to Egypt.
Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was the target of an attack.
Blogger, the provider with which Zigiadas blog is given a home, on the other hand, is further accessible.
Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video showing how the police practised physical violence against two students.
His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.
In a Facebook comment, Ziadah expressed himself about the government's blockage and reflected what this meant for him:
Blocking blogs is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:
1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs, as well as any other web page for which I was working.
2) You have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only on a small audience.
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.
First I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.
But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.
The brave ones go the way to the end.
According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.
Afte also documented the locking of providers through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Afte reported in her research:
On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages offered by VPNs began.
Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users may have access to.
"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the reasoning decisions are being made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed to court against these acts." ""
Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will it attack next?
Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?
The inhabitants fight.

Newspapers from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives, report day after day newspapers all over Brazil.
Some of these headlines are as follows:
"14-year-old was shot in school," "On the second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "thieves smokes pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers from the army, navy and air to Rio."
In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violence wave reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.
The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.
Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.
"" "so the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio" "" "Extra" "" "on August 16 published the editorials" "" "This is not normal," "" "in which she announced to establish a new column called" "" "war in Rio" "". "" ""
All reports about violence in the city are now published there.
The newspaper explains the motives for their decision:
It will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world, such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!
This is the only alternative, so as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.
In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:
It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.
In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to information from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 territories controlled by criminal organisations.
In the editorial, the newspaper writes:
We are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to retouch atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions.
But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.
Does the term "war" harm more than it does?
In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war." in her opinion, this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police officer.
This is not a war.
This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of the public sector.
To commemorate: the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.

According to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro says: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.
None of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
"" "when we look at the murders per state, Rio lies in place 16," "" "she writes." ""
Extra owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.
These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by using a massive police bloc and permanently stationing a unit there.
In the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. but after several years, the UPP was increasingly becoming increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities intended to protect the newly created police unit.
On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux was quoted from an article published in 2010 explaining why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention as a "civil war."
He writes:
In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for human beings.
This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war. this includes intrusion into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."
War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.
A week ago, the police came up with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.
In the midst of all this violence, this incident caused headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.

To stay alive: besieged Syrians learn to plant mushrooms

Source: CanDoAction
Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the ensuing civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.
According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, in Damascus and the surrounding area, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege.
Particularly affected is the region east of Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.
Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.
Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which led to local inhabitants to rely locally or through tunnels and control points.
Due to the many years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.
As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."
They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Adala.
Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged Eastern Ghouta.
The Directly of the Project, Abo Nabil, told the French news agency AFP:
"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""
"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, who has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now becoming more and more" "" "gaining popularity" "". "" ""
In order to raise money for the initiative, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is in agreement with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.
According to Dr. Leila, it is planned to teach 125 families to plant fungi, as Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.
At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about 12,700 €, but will continue to raise donations to CanDo until Monday, 4th September 2017.
The initiative relies on generators that hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.
Because of the fuel shortage locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.
"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began with the" "" "production of mushrooms from the regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""
Then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a bigger tub. and so on.
"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""
Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi free of charge anywhere in Eastern Ghouta.
Dr. Leila said that it is part of a larger movement.
"" "" "" "we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons" "" ": breaking the siege." ""
Providing a new source of food on the market.
Dissemination of a culture of self-sufficiency by using food leftovers (such as paper, tea, coffee, cardboard, etc) to extract new food.
Creating new jobs, especially for women who work at home.
Creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes.
"" "he said," "" "We hope to spread this idea all over the world, so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will become visible." ""

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal.
Forty-two persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the government to last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.
Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.
It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.
In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.
According to the European Forestry Monitoring System, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the Lisbon region.
So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.
The whole of Portugal burns in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata (@ a _ ataner) October 15th, 2017
Some pictures shared by Twitter users:
This is Braga this night. # PrayForPortugal # Braga # FogosPT
Numerous videos spread over the web and show images that allow better insights into what happened:
The predictable tragedy
The goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.
People wondered why civil protection was unable to curb the scale of the tragedy as far as possible.
João Soveral from the Confederation of farmers of Portugal declared the paper Público:
After Pedrógão streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.
This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire.
"" "in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were closed very late." "" "" ""
Furthermore, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.
A far-reaching proposal for the Waldread government introduced by the government after serious fires between 2003 and 2005 was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments.
"" "" "" "the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed the construction activity if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open rear door, so that everything could be built," "" "João Sorval explains in the same article by the newspaper Público." ""
The environmental organisation Quercus drew attention to the fact that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of easily inflammable wood, as in a vicious circle, continued to spread to fires of this kind.
In addition to these problems, the website of Civil Defence of Portugal on 15th and 16th October, when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.
It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used its own civilian protection data with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.
The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was thus crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the server did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: the site counted more than half a million visitors.
Even the founder asked for help:

The way from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneur

One night in the autumn of 1994, the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.
Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.
Exactly at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the Ethnic Group of Hazara, spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan.
Even if his mother didn't say it that way, she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.
In the morning, the boy should break.
His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.

Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many hazards suddenly felt vulnerable.
The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.
Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.
A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.
For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him ill.
Then he took what was left of his little reward and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar that were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his living.
Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.
"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "remembered Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we worked." ""
There was no service and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows to prevent us from freezing at night. "
After four years, Asharaf dismissed his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.
During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.
After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.
Some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy twice a day.
It is true that due to relatively high ratings, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.
The Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, "the system" suffers from a general lack of transparency.
"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""
According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum, which can still withdraw for months after the registration of the asylum application.
Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.
And so did Asharaf.
But his immortal will helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.
After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his total savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice.
This was so good that after a while, he opened a second hostel and a fast snack bar.
Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "after Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.
In 2017, the film won the Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.

The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.
A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.
According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.
For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries.
In recent years, several Afghan-powered companies, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have emerged.
Some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.
In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea for his Restaurant Oriental Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.
The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.
The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.
But Asharafs targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country he had forced to leave as a teenager.
"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.
I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.
"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else." "" "" ""
"" "Asharaf also plans plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""
The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.
Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.
Netizen Report: Egypt's draft laws enable shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.
He reported about the clearance of the camp of Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.

Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, wins and emerging trends in global internet rights
The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority.
Users must register in order to use the social networks within six months of the successful decision of the law on the authority's website, stating their full name and identification number.
Those who missed this step could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months or a penalty.
The law, which has been promoted by sixty-five members of the Parliament, is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.
"" "" "" "in May, another deputy presented a legislative proposal in which harsher penalties for the insult of the president or high officials would be introduced." ""
Under the law proposition, such an act would be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.
If the law is passed, this may be up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.
In addition, this would underline a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.
A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while fighting violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.
After four years in prison, Shawkan was waiting four years in prison for a court appointment.
Recently, his trial was postponed for 20 May because the prison leadership according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.
Shawkan faces the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups are unanimous, among other things arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.
In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi's blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.
The Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.
Interrogated Tunisian activists on leaked documents
In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.
Ben Gharbia has been largely interrogated to a sophisticated action plan. according to the plan, the President of the Republic, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill supporting businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption.
The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April casts a light on how the presidential plans for the support of the legislation look like.
Ben Gharbia flatly rejected the attribution of his sources under the guidance of Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, assuring journalists the right to protect their sources.
Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case.
Does China want to force social media users to submit their identification document?
According to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media.
In addition, it is stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.
Analysts suspect that by this the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.
Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat?"
Not in Russia!
May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.
"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat, in the state government, failed to register as an" "" "organizer of information distribution." "" "" ""
This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that "organize" the publication of the information. "the law also allows the government to take responsibility for the removal of content and force it upon request to suspend user data.
These web pages currently include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoblniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the mail service Mail.Ru and dozens of other services.
Turkish court decrees Wikipedias blockage
Turkish court ordered Wikipedias locking in Turkey after Wikipedia admins have refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.
"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication gave up the site because it became" "" "a source of information that cooperates with groups to make a political defamation campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""
It is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website, including China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.
United Kingdom can't stop sniffing
After this week of leaked documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a deliberate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install malware programs that decrypt data encryption.
The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.
Despite all this, the consultation still runs until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.
