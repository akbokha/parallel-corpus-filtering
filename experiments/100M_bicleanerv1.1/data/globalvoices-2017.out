although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less journalist expos@@ ing the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was , as if that was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very sham@@ eful letter of love about its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never holds with his mind behind the mountain as you say so nicely .
he tells us exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people re@@ acted to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes that he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ k , director of the journ@@ alism programme that welcomes people from all over the world , a deeply believing human being with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wel@@ tan@@ schauung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for life the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she is still adap@@ ting to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who has always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew goo@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tr@@ ump paved the way to the nom@@ in@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps . perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note from white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ) : white and whi@@ plas@@ h based on white and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means so much like sk@@ id@@ ding trauma ) , as the big Van Jones described , exactly what made America so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a vast part of the white American of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un Khan , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded by saying : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America anymore .
and that breaks my heart .

out of the Po@@ or to the Stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through garbage
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what does the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music gang ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and the violence of gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered his youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day after day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments , composed of local solid waste materials , is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra performed on instruments made of recycled material called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content together .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the land of Liber@@ ian waters before the other coast of Africa was sought .
the East African countries were accordingly aff@@ righ@@ ted and somewhat inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ites , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to stop one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pil@@ lage of fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fishing ) in 2012 .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that then exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were imped@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the pace of sn@@ ails , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can share lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . such suspi@@ cious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its catch fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such examinations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on their way and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
on the basis of this information , countries opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to reg@@ ain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose every year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world , including those illegal fish@@ ers .
their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , imag@@ inary seeds , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ fully organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could fish illegal and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not run my harbor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole now attempts to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 research of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has exposed criminal networks that had spread bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps pin@@ point the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fish@@ ers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system linking different levels of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that offers satellite data and which can display the position of each track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours , to get a better picture of who is doing what is happening - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them .
ships which formerly were fishing without license and had hardly expected consequences , know now that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile accounted for a 33 % increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped Somalia to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there tow@@ ing nets on board which were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 six countries joined forces to form the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty , the aim is to allow even more of such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was flying under false flag . and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working across the oceans .

their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Pri@@ mary Education , New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela continue to spin : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; reg@@ aining the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are seen as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s dis@@ repair .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void , re@@ acted by gathering in the streets .
under h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : Venezuela &apos;s ref@@ unds ) , both images of these demonstrations and arguments can be found for and against them .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including the low@@ land Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current president , Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the detention of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ operative at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and spiral rate are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment is considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( around : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day , as well as a march to Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , to continue to block the referendum .
Twitter has been commented on Twitter as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also clas@@ hes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .

on Twitter images that talk about confron@@ tations as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government , according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise one could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic is already making the round , which forms the amount of repression per day :
thus dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ dering procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado say that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !

others are further analy@@ sing these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from its point of view , had little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to refra@@ in from mu@@ til@@ ating critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adap@@ table version of an interview published by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cór@@ doba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investig@@ ates crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept his family secret for 34 years .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , it is not noticeable that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Military Intelligence Department of 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the amount of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend there@@ on .

you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
take care not to kidn@@ ap you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - Revolutionary Pop@@ ular Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
that is why he forbi@@ d me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ da@@ w@@ ned the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great lum@@ ps of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were dropped and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a cot and metal feathers .
later I found out that they fastened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they seldom prof@@ essed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , cast it with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a fil@@ thy win@@ dy .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied in hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and were killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were several rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , the civilian Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was beaten to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way in which the ab@@ duc@@ ted came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came up that they were to be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that you have fought against an enemy you fought against .

but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... that &apos;s not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to inv@@ ade a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I &apos;ll find you and kill yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
that was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . I had both my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put a burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ En@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel regret .
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses van@@ ish ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl back home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided not to kill these people , but why would their cor@@ p@@ ses van@@ ish ?
did these people not even have families that could be handed down to their mortal remains ?
the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act that can be done to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course anything remains .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed humans ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought to show my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I gave him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt internally displaced and asked myself what all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they supposedly defended were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me for being pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I finally testified against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years .

&quot; &quot; &quot; an error in translation makes elderly people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shield with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long your driving license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving license have been witness@@ ing a particularly mis@@ fortun@@ at@@ y translation last month .
on a sign the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ bel@@ sha ) , the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means , wrong@@ ly - perhaps also with evil rear @-@ thought &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st - 20th .
adaptation of the original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the fault was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n published in Kyoto has written :
&quot; how could there be an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and simply unacceptable in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , even gram@@ mati@@ cally correct designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture have ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger related the ap@@ ologies as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a proportion of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the name not mentioned in the article published in Yahoo &apos;s article published comments on the light , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to rise against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error was given among others the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So wrong is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and provide active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language , who could translate translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can nevertheless produce translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is valued as the best , becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .

mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences resulting from machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest British form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery , but from large companies or from the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translation .
Venezuela : take up protests and cens@@ orship on internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
other users later wrote that the internet sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers were also taking photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was kidn@@ apped , and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Zen@@ it : enables your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked .
this is from @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting about protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO Vega Fil@@ in@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond correctly to requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies wrong@@ ly or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was broadcast on Thursday 6 April when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried out the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned .
Flor@@ es was beaten as he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country .
in Paraguay too many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers evidence of other crimes that have become victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use courtesy of structural .
the following article is the shortened version of a report of structural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Mis@@ sing Schools &quot; ) edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school are called cri@@ adi@@ s .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their minor daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with cri@@ adi@@ s - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude in@@ oc@@ ulated by the cri@@ p@@ ta guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family that their daughter believes in the belief that she can complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that takes the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know of it .
in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent sho@@ cks . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o who works as an official at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra struck Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ cket .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela held the deep @-@ rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest and demanded that there should be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered than children , &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the cri@@ adi@@ s are not only exploited as workers , they also live in isolation from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Job@@ bik in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go all the work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time so she stayed for a while to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
for example , it cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would once again speak their mother tongue guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their masters were afraid that they would lose the education they had allowed them to lose again .

also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken of is mo@@ b@@ bing and har@@ ass@@ ment to which cri@@ adi@@ s are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home to me . I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where job ads for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay can be shared .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comment@@ aries .
a woman from the site Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and she gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very hand@@ some , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author switched to the display again :
dear friends , I &apos;ve found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ b@@ án@@ do ?
( cri@@ adi@@ s , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former crimes , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history , we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Early History of Paraguay , in which the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ an@@ í people were ens@@ la@@ ved and subjected to Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( where the workers are treated as semi @-@ slaves ) .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty @-@ one Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to a bill on &quot; the regulations regarding the use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up that is in charge of giving citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the Act , users on the site must register with their proper names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a fine of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , vide@@ oc@@ aching and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose registration . it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users got a username and password from the Ministry of Communications to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . because of that , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Senior Research Techni@@ ologist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case .
technically , this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it comes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in which the control will be maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a criminal off@@ ence against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; raising protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish nature prot@@ ector protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the Iraq marked by war

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which stre@@ wn through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of wild animals , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . therefore , when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist R@@ aza is passion@@ ately fond of a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an Region .
Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , has produced this video for En@@ sia .
his works have been published in numerous international publications including TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times .
Meyer made films for National Ge@@ ographic , P@@ BS , CN@@ N and HB@@ O .

in early March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o daily documented the progress achieved in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had spark@@ ed the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring islands Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture had a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later to re@@ build the local residents &apos; lives .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of those affected .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ homes were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed here .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
at the same time , six years after the disaster , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of accommodation establishments , ev@@ acu@@ ated by accommodation , could be reloc@@ ated to final replacement houses .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster , almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 more than 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the people who ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 were still living in emergency shel@@ ters whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees who lived in homes after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by disaster have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fish@@ eries &quot; ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation , only 30 percent of the fish@@ eries &quot; ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear prolifer@@ ation zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is still lag@@ ging behind .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to obtain a complete picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres . she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy with the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk has changed .
in their introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents think that hasn &apos;t been done enough in disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
some 75@@ ,000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture by 16@@ 0,000 people .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
according to the 2017 status , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma need to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people from other countries meet , who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater at first than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , one often recognizes that one more combines than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ hu@@ man explains how the love of music has strengthened its affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma after being beaten up by the police at nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer hit him with a stick against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . across the country , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and moved him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs hur@@ ry shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also sub@@ merged in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he left the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police joined a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group , only to crimin@@ alise teachers , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who hit him with a stick in his face .
police assault arti@@ llery
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for or@@ ators .
the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media ou@@ sted street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were target@@ ing a broken glass window to illustrate their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photograph .
O Glob@@ o , on the other hand , preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ ted Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on a Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after laying down , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory lost its facilities gradually until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve him of his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation again because they have been preserved .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene seems to have heard exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am I would get the sugar cane mill , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for cal@@ ming the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the congregation saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again some decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 cent per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural Pro@@ spec@@ tives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the first words of Cu@@ ban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories came to a halt , with more than 65 million people receiving their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of birth , the first letters began to come .
officially composed documents were distinguished only concerning the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve every removal .
from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers still operating in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he was building .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ top producer has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services that the systems generated in the congregations in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President looked in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closing of sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high by milling since 2004 .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the folk group Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane mill closed , or rather than they began to un@@ mask , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospect of the future , many young people also left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the village where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine ti@@ thes bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ eso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and a clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies you told him .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at age 65 , not because he lacks strength , but because he is bitter .

the workshop thus enters into discussions on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the State of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ Sum@@ mon@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters are not always profi@@ cient in the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young@@ sters involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as is a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if no one ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and as well as our youth go forward
so they can do what the Creator has ordained for .
in the commentary , the reader and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ name ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for the most part ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( for the most part , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are displayed by any food served in this restaurant .
the customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the death district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a multitude of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend is turning them into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin z@@ pur@@ u .
now in a special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y gather@@ ings , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that keeps your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for your mobile phone , this is a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ic .
some mobile stand and cell phone designers will allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ chief and killed appear on a regular basis only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ els , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict to the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looking at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were engaged in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves again today for the task we have placed to go and to search for the tom@@ bs , for the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentices@@ hip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are we going to get this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for some years now .
I pass the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from experts .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bound@@ lessness of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they do not stir and are still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the entry &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family with threats was pill@@ aged . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals were squee@@ zing money from their business month by month , until they had torn apart the business in the end , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact ourselves if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , as you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
in these aw@@ ful days I wonder@@ ed if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation committed by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was over@@ thrown by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Council for Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ tico founded the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this article and the pages to which he links include images on which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the year after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to image trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it raises questions about our desire for images on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died there .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated it . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of homes , including a movie theater near which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and char@@ ded cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident portra@@ y the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ ded bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at it .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo was taken over several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote island of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses have reported dras@@ tically the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were found in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated by satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from DR Congo appeared again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has been docum@@ enting access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass kill@@ ings .
yet another step further personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relates the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could strike , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which fal@@ sely claimed in 2012 that the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Being said that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations named AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to being this statement , but had not related the image from DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false dec@@ lines date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually from all over the world .
an &quot; reverse image search &quot; enables you to see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries .
an in@@ verse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo .
they come from a mixing mask of private pages , social media platforms and community and national publications and are available in many different languages including English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have sent false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have enclosed examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of what side they have been published on . as a result , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which have been linked to each other in some cases ) , several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage can come from .
here are some cases that can now be r@@ ins@@ ed completely ( on the card in orange ) :
map : News frames .
national examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also show for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image taken from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( aimed at Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side that raised rum@@ ours was that the said photo shows Christians who were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City names not only the false report but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .

in this article about explo@@ sions in northern Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian section of the village .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ tering contributions after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one , who used the image from DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no sides like Ho@@ ax@@ b@@ ster who dispro@@ ve this .

even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to commit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being persecuted , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government has published a definition of what they came as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intentionally dark news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this setting , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech use and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; fen@@ cer scanning puerto rico &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo is not Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar T@@ a had admitted 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , published now , has explicitly stated that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo di@@ pped , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to reach a greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times res@@ cu@@ ed ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false report .
the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos stood away from the embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Grau ) , Tin@@ Eye also points , but are no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps are available on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original piece of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to major discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of the Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been comprehen@@ sively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these images even are demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study examining how violent media are working on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent accounts in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which a picture suggests something which can actually be used from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , every investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally it can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ removable ) endeav@@ ours to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( e.g. the Spanish Sob@@ rem@@ esa ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a while in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ at@@ u &apos;s tax @-@ cla@@ p language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - take care of your parents in recognition of how they have taken care of you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after getting war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze and classi@@ fy the world around us , the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive are these little languages .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Languages , which are appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite speakers here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally employs at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 bor@@ ou@@ ghs in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster relief centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missed because of the floods and mud waves .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were sent to 304 health resorts .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are wor@@ sen@@ ing the crisis of den@@ gue , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ o@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water p@@ eg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a which occurred yesterday .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and five other five are made to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and food @-@ nec@@ essi@@ ties for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Taxi @-@ Call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks competent people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for pickup of assistance and donations . these were then rel@@ ayed to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ische Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by flood and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully utili@@ sed , bring people in need of security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long road to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that one cannot see
the Women &apos;s March is January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a friend .
I entr@@ ust to her my four years old daughter ; she trusted in me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next round , we are en@@ forcing rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , tied from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in their imagination .
they de@@ fi@@ gured me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims who do not fit into it , Muslims are ab@@ duc@@ ted .
to be ab@@ duc@@ ed
I am not alone .
this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing picture language is determined by the dark man who was to be feared and the exotic woman to be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images continue to stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality of nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the United States did not even elect their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has st@@ aff@@ ed our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ lessly that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the tune of 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims account for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the population of the Muslim population are African @-@ Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was thinking of the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were tired Muslims and Americans .
but am I now def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess Muslims and Americans ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ p@@ ah W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ester , we don &apos;t carry all bags of bags with us .
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist skill machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which have manipul@@ ated our already flaw@@ ed picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than a stranger , who tears a woman &apos;s head sc@@ arf .
or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the U.S. , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ever @-@ ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter if I were silent in my arms and whis@@ per@@ ing the Arabic verses for protection that seal the Qur &apos;@@ an and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , poses with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is on the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as she has been winning a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its finished and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can virtually mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means speaking the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - for centuries - became colon@@ ized by an &quot; Empire &quot; which has founded a company with the name hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not we@@ ep but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan was weeping for his family in India ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , family whom he could not close in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as in the game risk .
to be Muslim means knowing that over the last two centuries , Europeans have colon@@ ized up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was thrown down over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir under@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion belong deeply into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy threat@@ ens the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first cry of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave called Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X is an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this branch establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders with people from just the countries that are being bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targeted Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we carry and the bombs that we reject on Muslim lands .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades back to recognise the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous ima@@ gery we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news articles .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ ante ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet have now led the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they dominate major areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me an un@@ bound Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb lane in my speech .
things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may sound where someone is being made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations will take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Facebook page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and human@@ ized by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance , was even a scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president who feeds chocolate cake , while he already bombar@@ ded countries and &quot; to other &quot; man @-@ made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be any way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and honor the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening , to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers insert their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and presentation lead to the audience getting involved .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ik@@ ara tells the tale of the Rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the Sh@@ ona language :
after explaining the importance of his f@@ ables , John Ny@@ eff@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were alert ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend it . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling presentations .
Puerto Rico claims to re@@ establish public debt from the United States
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debts of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march launched at the capit@@ ol Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural exam of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ taining debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
the people of Puerto Rico require that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed remuneration paid to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the national sovereignty of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed from the outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missed for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , an event hosted by the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , published last year and is available free of charge , contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what is the real cost with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was taken out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us begin thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police had taken Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal in his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented himself as the in@@ sider of the Assad administration and who were informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
but his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at present the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the cultural prototypes was fores@@ eeable than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of many civili@@ zations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles mer@@ ges with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he started working , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip of stri@@ fe in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project up until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting , a rehear@@ sal that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ i .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind at the moment in which we embrace ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guards
I forget the prison of the prison
and I penetrate every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

the story of Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption condem@@ ning director after release again on previous post
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambique responded with anger to a corruption case in which a government member after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state machine where corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants due to mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million me@@ tics ( about 800@@ ,000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambique airports , whose council has ruled Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which happened on 19th April .
in accordance with the opinion of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer to his old post as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution supporting public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re@@ charge the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary action against the counter @-@ tra@@ ded .
the company , however , apparently kept and in@@ stituted no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ per &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be an advisor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been served .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re @-@ integrated into the company he helped to harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any moral authority :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that already insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za fails to return to morality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in jail :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered by the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans as the first independent president , but also as sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve , and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he firmly affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and was free .
and today the company , in which he tre@@ ads up funds , sets him back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ saws ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spl@@ itting b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or , for all , all@@ ways ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically produce hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored in order to express their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ki@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was extingu@@ ished today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
but he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook needs to be more analy@@ tic before breaking all the posts that were suspected of being rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ e@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ its ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech are getting a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to share his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to pay , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t comply with the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed many posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work like that .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely resolved posts .
if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech but were nevertheless removed :

Bur@@ m@@ ese Text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is said to increase violence in communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where clas@@ hes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to take control of the us@@ uri@@ ous hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sites .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code @-@ concentr@@ ating initiatives and learn from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ bearing age is now 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members held in practice Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ch Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( I@@ RO ) , said that the State should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN children &apos;s rights convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined by everyone under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children that have already been married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 young were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media moves that were trying to aboli@@ sh laws on to@@ e , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
however , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the chil@@ dr@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they should , dam@@ n themselves look after their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tension in this really un@@ complicated affair , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the draft law at all .
but early in 2017 , the bill against the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not one against it .
after it was approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws on children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
Lov@@ ell Francis , a Facebook member of the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk to disgu@@ ise the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson thought that it took a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which states : , Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ enden News !
the marriage network has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
torture Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about the importance of the adoption of the law :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the proposal to am@@ end the married couple was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were present voted for the law .
the pedi@@ atri@@ cian is no longer legally allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ care label .
many thanks to all the activists who fought it .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj proclaimed his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed , and he seems to release his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wanted to address the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
rather , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about the fact that the state , our daughters , prevents them from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men , who are opposed to them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page in English was presented on 18 January 2012 , in contra@@ distinction to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright law in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series resist@@ ing the block@@ age .
although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy internet users are used to using wrapping tools for blocked web pages ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia in 2008 , as recently published in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular internet block@@ ages have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second best known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( thus machine calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is not@@ e@@ worthy , despite legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS talks about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we tried everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents in de@@ centralized and distributed ways .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar irr@@ or@@ sites , when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as employees at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one acc@@ esses to a different URL that is not the original . that which one can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ h@@ len@@ se r@@ hin@@ o , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and balanced colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly in Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to cr@@ unch pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to co @-@ operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he was standing before &#91; him &#93; face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the sheep &apos;s opinion in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , mostly staying in a tent to shoot at the Bar@@ dia National Park footage of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
see some of these photos below .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of social pressure , they must respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , get this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by an Indian state , O@@ dish@@ a , and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married kin with a name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also widespread among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if at all those , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and quickly became the main topic of the city .
it is a place for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ c has been working with her video camera for seven years at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and manages these clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who do not name their hus@@ bands by their names .
she chose this issue because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women can easily identify with .
not speaking out loud for the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they are du@@ tiful and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who has never named her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband stayed for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in his luggage , Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the names of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women can never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only gi@@ ggle before himself during the whole exercise ; another decided to let out the entire fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law gaz@@ ed at her she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead , which indicates the status of the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who can hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their life they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine @-@ c@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of pants ; they did not trust themselves .
after much argument and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes , mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped talking to her husband &apos;s name .
some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viol@@ a for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate stream .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each one of us is a sacrifice of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged mem@@ o@@ irs and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noticed during the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . for the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo .
even today , songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les just survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll would represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial Site in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies use the fan base in terms of market conditions , such as this R@@ amen shop ( cycl@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat the R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to run .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men will be drag@@ ged and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia police warned the people that bald men could be target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of ab@@ duction of bald @-@ headed persons for organ trading , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ let , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , said the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men have been registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique , bald men in Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police according to the latest murder of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ let , where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ hed Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said the local police were already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this also draws the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambique in mind ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair fall@@ out problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty which Moz@@ ambique faces :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ I am ashamed of a country in which the teachers would be ashamed to demand sex against good marks , and to take sex against good marks , work and other benefits , a nation in which people would not hurt human activities or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or &quot; black magic &quot; are pursued .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter bene@@ fici@@ ary , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the boss of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the murder of bald men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) has a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people who claimed to be inside the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but did not give any further information .
his stay and the Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a was informed of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are doing all the work of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations that have been committed to their release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , thus the organization Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared from the regime are subjected to torture and even execution .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize winners and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 to Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( endanger@@ ing the state ) after he had participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o called for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and a spokes@@ man tells us that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China still maintains calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to permit him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised several reactions from abroad .
United Nations Educational Tal@@ ks
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u a treatment abroad .
Norway and the world
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ enden refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government made it clear that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as she announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to elev@@ ate all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
us ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treating abroad in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the embassy asks the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy requested an angry response from China , with the Foreign Ministry statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice on which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can embar@@ k on proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and the Netherlands
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources were reported in Beijing by the news agency Reu@@ ters , that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u might over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to worry about his family .
Li@@ u Adv@@ oc@@ ate told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom of expression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
in a statement on 29 June , France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually take it up .
Taiwan Museum and Taiwan
the Council of the Festival Affairs in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in a statement on June 28 about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the International branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the single political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city to be considered .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice of &quot; turning the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from those responsible , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old Ly@@ re comes up from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leave the distorted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he disgu@@ ised relevant questions with non @-@ answers in a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this , associates right and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
did Herr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam have committed a mistake or was it a Freu@@ dian Spe@@ aker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance .
why do the Singap@@ ore@@ ans afford their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have been anno@@ yed by many Singap@@ ore@@ ans ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked for in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I reply . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have been living there and back in Japan .
depending on which situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans might be war@@ y of anger if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bo@@ ther about that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all beloved Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some issues with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be phi@@ list@@ ine - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not to pay attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just chil@@ ly pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence along with the neighbours .
we lack the warm , open kindness which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video released by the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend does .
although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing the settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest milit@@ ants and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosec@@ ute persons accused of le@@ ver@@ aging the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict law against &quot; read Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that purchasing is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ag@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ bas@@ ins of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , East Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today the majority of Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , known as ch@@ uk@@ ch@@ kov@@ ite , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are in decay and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to finish it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha gh@@ ost town .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they pull back immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl is whis@@ per@@ ing something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and van@@ ishes .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina didn &apos;t leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ ch@@ asia forever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
she has lived in her house for some time together with her husband and the five common children .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply departed ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for each child , Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 child allowance .
her husband works in the carbon pit .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
while they are running , some of them throw rocks on the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure un@@ so@@ lic@@ it@@ ness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured ear rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear @-@ form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - there are still hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants coming here .
sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , people come to the full little bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you m@@ um@@ my Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , they buy them medication , which they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to be able to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to normally make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money necessary to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez re@@ counts that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people will help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single trav@@ eller , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the travellers consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez appears happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly as she introduces herself to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi were given a cell phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app to fight terrorism for more than ever .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged news with a private we@@ av@@ chat group .
the police said that the app would identify and track down the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app with min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China usually focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often ble@@ ak for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( as well ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen accidentally checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are being discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .

the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued a decree with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a whole series of other possible crime rates , including those related to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you are looking at and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside .
one that gives honour to their name .
one who has settled down in a list of feelings and phrases that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into being flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the earth is spinning on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they tried me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of security tru@@ sts formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , but my own not .
for the first time , it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not set high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with government security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a magnificent picture that fully fulfilled my expectations .
in such a moment , you are aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you could swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an was standing there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we &apos;re not nearby . &quot;
his fi@@ erc@@ ely @-@ filled eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped gaz@@ ing at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition lies in my nose until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I took care of all the details before I enter the room .
in contrast to what else they have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share them with only one single prisoner and I am allowed to put them immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the police left the cell , and I reached an old @-@ tried communication method : beating against the wall with the f@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ convic@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the complete darkness , no markings can be seen on me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
of all the li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to remove all these crow@@ s , which are lab@@ elled with the fruits in the garden of my head .
from afar , I still hear them sh@@ out &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ it@@ or and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their view of the world .
this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can do so much more important with your life than to join those Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ eben and to protest on demonstrations that will soon end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to not responding .
I can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I did not have done anything to deserve this punishment .
on penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I wonder@@ ed if the investig@@ ator used to work as a refuse collector or if it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them switched off while I was still in the row .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I ceased to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t like it , which is why he went next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two horri@@ ble hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed which occurred to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fulfil@@ s the space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fe@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and keep away , you &apos;ll be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he shu@@ ff@@ les to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and then back to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the highest floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ u@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) .
for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with topics like ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are relevant not only in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking and , according to his own statement , can sympath@@ ize with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special tendency towards American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b views his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before .
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ ook water in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot day &apos;s day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , it is easy to do basic things like drinking water in the public during the Ram@@ adan , not to land in prison .
recently the Ministry of the Interior Jord@@ ani@@ ens announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the corporate statement .
the MPs and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled because of the sc@@ ary &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism which will question the old @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually reflects an ever @-@ growing reality in Jordan , which clearly mani@@ f@@ ests itself in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b promoted traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs extend up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in the last few years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary @-@ mor@@ des &apos; has been accepted in Jordan - the un@@ official externally left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary positions reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is further ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on the fight against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be kept in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee of the family are often necessary that the woman will not do anything .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects which in his country long considered tab@@ oo .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but conce@@ des that he cannot divor@@ ce his music , which is full of explicit promises of sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come out of the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been tri@@ cked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song repe@@ ating a verse often repe@@ ats :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that barely anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on the equality of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember later that his comments were torn , twi@@ sted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was uploaded on Youtube without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly advoc@@ ates the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they had vo@@ iced criticism on social media comment@@ aries on issues linked to deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , reas@@ oned and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region is approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one assumes that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fort@@ resses , the drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years , and from a time in which armies from west Japan moved to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ hi to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

seldom out@@ ward appearances and body care were so important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate occupation like the hair@@ style .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 revealed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , experiences rising demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles by famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more normal citizens entering the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; held since 2014 .
experts will compete against each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and receive training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel exp@@ elled , to accommodate affection ?
this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la cum@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla war F@@ ARC ( German : Revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the Peace Treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a rhet@@ oric of war , and around the clock had their weapons in their hands , now have to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who is to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most of them .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC soldiers who will now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace . &quot;
to date , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I would never have thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters in person .
the members of the F@@ ARC acted as they had done before to receive orders from their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; said Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a , political science student .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed lay a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Palace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life has someone written such a beautiful thing to me , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran on me over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and placed me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war too , it was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
at the outset , students and some F@@ ARC leaders joined a discussion round .
the students were all raised up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has worked out on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and recogni@@ zing that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
for example , Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bi@@ ans have been proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people ready to pick up arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all advoc@@ ates of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mac@@ er@@ ova and whose first publication was published on the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ r@@ ors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community there is not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya conquered the international head@@ lines after reports were published bringing about the spread , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities that arrested suspected qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ y and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the sex equ@@ ation of their landing , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
she moved to the United States because of fear of her life .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer at a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around I felt something in my body , but I hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honour the family , you flock ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung wing .
O@@ OC Media : in which health wings you have been placed - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having respect with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that it was all a lie .
they ordered absurd demands : some said to me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ y and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have told on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family manage to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it happened the third time , I realized that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OK Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering me , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in at the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I inserted the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when chat@@ ting with camera , I actually try to look at how the person looks at them from their past - so on my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been in ar@@ gun for a month and a half .
he told us that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not exclude a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
this is what I mean , they probably charge relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OK Media : are gay men still det@@ ained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there &apos;s not too many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relative or who were dropped by their relatives to make Cad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are captured there so that they can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked some village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun for a month and a half .
he says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was there even when these people were taken along .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits but there were no reports about this yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I wore my hair always long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore tubes and short loops .
the Ministry of Defense of Sh@@ aria has never crossed my hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches stood and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say it to children when they make fun of the sick .
OK Media : so they just shut their eyes off you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ zeit last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov res@@ ig@@ ned .
when he became prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at before looked at you once with suspicion .
in the meantime I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you have now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise tea riffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I do not miss a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I kl@@ ap@@ per@@ ated the type of refuge .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ bug ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
nature is so , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you know with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es have those who have Kab@@ ard@@ inian which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not really sad because of that - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a sharp rise in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi group in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to arise , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who would like to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube gave the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani Hospital in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August in the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fol@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have changed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all fathers of the family who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on the grounds of persecution by the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where much of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to maintain their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
a century ago , the Arab foref@@ ather was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi Mon@@ archy took power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , star@@ vation and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only managed to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth has now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and have 45 % university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist headquartered in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
because function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities across all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their name and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and be hired as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treat@@ able depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . added by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published in the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even suggest well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men despite equal education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms ensure that women sooner or later meet a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all of this is aware of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , black C@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under ra@@ cial se@@ gregation and discrimination ; if I mention the way we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists have been silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; raise their voices and &quot; singing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often are referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , which relate both to gender and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an un@@ men@@ ded and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that , through cultural appropri@@ ation , absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin colour and gender , because some of them will continue to be silent about the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word femin@@ ism is still in its name .
I prefer to fully isol@@ ate myself from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and status as a woman , rather than using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : recall ( example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) , we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped who make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement that affects the black woman .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m on account of my dark skin and on account of my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment in which my life is neither ignored nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
this article will be published once again as part of a content sharing agreement .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq non @-@ governmental organisation - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Alliance that is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;

Paragu@@ ay@@ an women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their grief over the women &apos;s mor@@ de in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; of Cor@@ pus . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent to her .
since the end of their relationship there was some time passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out because of abuse , the official display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also took advantage of nothing .
a few days later , the second woman returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women reimbur@@ se ads at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit to be victims of violence , to report to prosecution authorities at all .
cont@@ ent@@ ment 1 Be@@ aches and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that nothing under @-@ di@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good base , inadequate implementation hits and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports which , however , do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; explains them .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 indicators of domestic violence were reported to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here too .
in the advertisements 40 % of women said that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women said of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman reported in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women do not do that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , there are two women who are unable to do so because of physical abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement agencies cannot properly document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violent acts by men .

invisible abuse and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want it , but then still gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ table for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too mis@@ erable because they are fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the Paraguay authorities in order to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good base , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of law was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Lux@@ e ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Re@@ e@@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ini@@ d will lead to an independent criminal record and to punish the har@@ sh@@ er as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the text of the law changed in some respects to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was denied , which is currently banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ish@@ able with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to cost the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs that the victims of violence have to bear on their own , if they just want to pay a complaint and want to receive a safe accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
in view of these facts , the perpetr@@ ators are complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are offen@@ ded .
we have to reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an sen@@ ate . previously , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victims again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media continues to attack attacks a year after bann@@ ing a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Venezu@@ el@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having deposited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sul@@ tan &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , restric@@ ting public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ra@@ ct .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists from expressing their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its foundation in 2007 on Cor@@ ruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after an article published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 titled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties &quot; H@@ ands of Justice . &quot; this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high level parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took over the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the directive that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper is prohibited on any road , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the Court in Mas@@ k@@ at on 26 September 2016 .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by interference of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and of slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year ban was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail was set in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari for six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month jail sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he served his first prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the Az@@ am@@ n paper .
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper still faces attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of Az@@ am@@ n was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of Az@@ am@@ n was extended by three additional months , and with what the minister once again opposed the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times press freedom has been viol@@ ated .
other violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and can exercise without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects than elsewhere in the poor@@ est countries of Africa , and lack of investment in research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for the Research of Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed serious consequences for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he resear@@ ched the HIV virus itself before deciding to go back home in order to support the Sam@@ ba health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Sam@@ bian National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
CC : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipients instead of being themselves cre@@ ators .
the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
CC : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
CC : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
CC : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
CC : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
CC : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system means that magazines can only be made available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ standing Gor@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work has only been limited by his own imagination and the question of how many sorts of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding .
the patents are not only valid for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance to disease , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ el varieties . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts in food security are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still growing salad , but it needs to be longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der that I have to mate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot; he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those features he wants .
however , he is very careful not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
it has also joined a movement growing in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red roman let@@ tu@@ ce of the &quot; Green@@ house &quot; variety in the &quot; Green@@ house &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant bree@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seed to breed their own varieties , and not immediately cut it out - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds therefore play a role in larger contexts , such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; he says and takes control of increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples are the combinations of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , which are being offered in farmers markets for example , should also know that the manner in which this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains free , as opposed to patented seed and plant features .
photo taken by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ el features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only complic@@ it .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet available , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that plants that are grown naturally like wheat are still more patented than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are cultivated in such a way that they have pur@@ pos@@ efully desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves as far as such , due to which they prosp@@ er in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is far more necessary than ever since the modified conditions are much more likely to be predicted by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also vital for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property is in possession of other bree@@ ders as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ets promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
such protection does not prevent innovation , it encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not support innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to facilitate their work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form themselves and as bree@@ ders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pes , Plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i Management Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce her@@ bi@@ cides , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exact opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they hold it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
Mor@@ ton is also the opinion that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am stronger than companies with my efforts to produce new products .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition , which makes it very easy to do with my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre collabor@@ ates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ col works on an &quot; open source &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for bree@@ ders differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be joined one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for Hi@@ v@@ os , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems , which should be the official start of the official launch next year .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report from aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes farmers have the opportunity to feed on seeds , exchange and improve seed policy and ensure stable food supply .
the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by from O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food mainly focused on where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains consistent despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as it is now .
it is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network origin@@ ating from Qatar because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web side closures fell victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt anymore .
Zi@@ da used his blog for the pre@@ val@@ ence of articles and articles that he writes for websites and media that are in@@ accessible to Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with which Zi@@ gi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video showing how the police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ad@@ ah expressed himself about the government &apos;s block@@ age and reflected what this meant for him :
blocking blo@@ gs is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs , as well as any other web page for which I was working .
2 ) You have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , al@@ beit only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the locking of providers through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) .
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages offered by V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users may have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the reason@@ ing decisions are being made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed to court against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants fight .

newspapers from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives , report day after day newspapers all over Brazil .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; On the second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smo@@ kes pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , nav@@ y and air to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violence wave reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16 published the edi@@ tori@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to establish a new column called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explains the motives for their decision :
it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to information from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 territories controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to ret@@ ou@@ ch atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it does ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; in her opinion , this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police officer .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of the public sector .
to commemor@@ ate : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro says : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio lies in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police blo@@ c and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . but after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly becoming increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities intended to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from an article published in 2010 explaining why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention as a &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for human beings .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week ago , the police came up with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident caused head@@ lines : an or@@ ch@@ ard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the ensu@@ ing civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , in Damascus and the surrounding area , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
particularly affected is the region east of Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which led to local inhabitants to rely locally or through tunnels and control points .
due to the many years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the Project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , told the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now becoming more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining popularity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to raise money for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is in agreement with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
according to Dr. Lei@@ la , it is planned to teach 125 families to plant fung@@ i , as Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to raise donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i free of charge anywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. Lei@@ la said that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to extract new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government to last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European For@@ estry Monitoring System , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the Lisbon region .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
the whole of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread over the web and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the predictable tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Con@@ federation of farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the Wal@@ dre@@ ad government introduced by the government after serious fires between 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val explains in the same article by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continued to spread to fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of Civil Defence of Portugal on 15th and 16th October , when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used its own civilian protection data with the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was thus crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : the site counted more than half a million visitors .
even the founder asked for help :

one night in the autumn of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the Eth@@ nic Group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it that way , she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little reward and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar that were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows to prevent us from freezing at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af dismissed his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high ratings , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum , which can still withdraw for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and so did A@@ shar@@ af .
but his im@@ mortal will helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his total savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a fast snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; after Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 , the film won the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries .
in recent years , several Afgh@@ an @-@ powered companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have emerged .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea for his Restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
N@@ eti@@ zen Report : Egypt &apos;s draft laws enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearance of the camp of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , wins and emerging trends in global internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority .
users must register in order to use the social networks within six months of the successful decision of the law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identification number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months or a penalty .
the law , which has been promoted by sixty @-@ five members of the Parliament , is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another deputy presented a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or high officials would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , such an act would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may be up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ line a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while fighting violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
after four years in prison , Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting four years in prison for a court appointment .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed for 20 May because the prison leadership according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan faces the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are unanim@@ ous , among other things arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iz@@ a acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si &apos;s block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ ro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists on le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been largely inter@@ ro@@ gated to a sophisticated action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill supporting business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April casts a light on how the presidential plans for the support of the legislation look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia flat@@ ly rejected the attri@@ bution of his sources under the guidance of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , ass@@ uring journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case .
does China want to force social media users to submit their identification document ?
according to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media .
in addition , it is stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that by this the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to en@@ force these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat , in the state government , failed to register as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that &quot; organize &quot; the publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to take responsibility for the removal of content and force it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ bl@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the mail service Mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as block@@ age
Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as locking in Turkey after Wikipedia ad@@ mins have refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave up the site because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to make a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website , including China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
United Kingdom can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week of le@@ aked documents , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install malware programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation still runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
