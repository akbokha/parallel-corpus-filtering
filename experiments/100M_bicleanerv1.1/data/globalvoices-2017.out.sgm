<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the magnificent Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless journalist exposing the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was, as if that was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very shameful letter of love about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds with his mind behind the mountain as you say so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells us exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people reacted to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes that he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silk, director of the journalism programme that welcomes people from all over the world, a deeply believing human being with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Trumps" "" "Weltanschauung" "" "did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of Cincinnati Inquirer." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "in the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for life the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who has always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew gooey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump paved the way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps. perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note from white against all other ethnicities): white and whiplash based on white and whiplash, which means so much like skidding trauma), as the big Van Jones described, exactly what made America so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan man whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a vast part of the white American of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Khan, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "roared the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices became louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if anyone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded by saying: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America anymore.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community have in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de Música (music gang) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and the violence of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered his youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest landfill of Asunción in the capital of Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments, composed of local solid waste materials, is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra performed on instruments made of recycled material called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world produces about one billion tons of trash.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "landfill Harmonic" "" "follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music all around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content together.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the land of Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa was sought.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly affrighted and somewhat inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorites, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to stop one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillage of fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing) in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that then expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the pace of snails, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can share lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its catch fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on their way and possibly whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world, including those illegal fishers.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, imaginary seeds, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-fully organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier a ship could fish illegal and a country could then say" "" "You may not run my harbor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole now attempts to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 research of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks that had spread bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authorities to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps pinpoint the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system linking different levels of information. it should help FISH-i find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that offers satellite data and which can display the position of each trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours, to get a better picture of who is doing what is happening - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which formerly were fishing without license and had hardly expected consequences, know now that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile accounted for a 33% increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there towing nets on board which were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy us," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015 six countries joined forces to form the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With certainty, the aim is to allow even more of such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was flying under false flag. and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working across the oceans.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are seen as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's disrepair.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void, reacted by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: Venezuela's refunds), both images of these demonstrations and arguments can be found for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country, including the lowland Barinas, in the Andes-regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the federal state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the impeachment of the current president, Nicolás Maduro, but in the end the detention of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-operative at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and spiral rate are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on impeachment is considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (around: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called for a twelve-hour strike on the following day, as well as a march to Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, to continue to block the referendum.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptable version of an interview published by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentine news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigates crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept his family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, it is not noticeable that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realise that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Military Intelligence Department of 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive of files.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijjanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the amount of atrocities he had experienced as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend thereon.</seg>

<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo - Revolutionary Popular Army - the military arm of the Argentinian revolutionary workers "party.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbid me to go to the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me that I would be a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving license have been witnessing a particularly misfortunaty translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word (koreibelsha), the "older motorists" means, wrongly - perhaps also with evil rear-thought & # 8212; as "fearful motorists" translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st - 20th.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photographs by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The fault was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a population of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun published in Kyoto has written:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could there be an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture have apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger related the apologies as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are really sorry that elderly people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a proportion of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and provide active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language, who could translate translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can nevertheless produce translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is valued as the best, becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences resulting from machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest British formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but from large companies or from the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translation.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naval con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Other users later wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters were also taking photographs of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositional groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was kidnapped, and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenit: enables your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting about protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I registered at @ vivoplaynet again without cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO Vega Filintro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond correctly to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies wrongly or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS block: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third locked channel, was broadcast on Thursday 6 April when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas live, was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making Venezuelans more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a criadita as a child. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today, Tina is fighting for the rights of children and gathers evidence of other crimes that have become victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report of structural, which is published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying Cows, Missing Schools") edited and re-released by Global Voices of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her. "she's like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a criadita for the family. in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school are called criadis.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their minor daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and mistreatment - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with criadis - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude inoculated by the cripta guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family that their daughter believes in the belief that she can complete her education, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that takes the girl with her and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know of it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent shocks. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as an official at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck Marín as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cricket.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela held the deep-rooted practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest and demanded that there should be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered than children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín may be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The criadis are not only exploited as workers, they also live in isolation from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Jobbik in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all the work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so she stayed for a while to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, it cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited, because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings, the host Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorials from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought she was intelligent, but did not stay with her." "" "the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they did not often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would" "" "learn bad habits" "" "there again." "" "they said that Alvarenga, who belonged to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would once again speak their mother tongue guaraní." ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their masters were afraid that they would lose the education they had allowed them to lose again.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken of is mobbing and harassment to which criadis are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home to me. I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty-one Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to a bill on "the regulations regarding the use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "when it is adopted by the Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up that is in charge of giving citizens a permit to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the Act, users on the site must register with their proper names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a fine of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, videocaching and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose registration. it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattler, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users got a username and password from the Ministry of Communications to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall at the national level around Facebook. because of that, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But so far it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>

<seg id="513">"" "Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technologist (in German" "" "Senior Research Techniologist" "" ") at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, on German" "" "Egyptian initiative for personal rights" "" "), told Global Voices:" ""</seg>

<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court case.</seg>
<seg id="517">Technically, this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it comes into the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is consistent with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in which the control will be maximised and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which strewn through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus Saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of wild animals, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is small and goes against zero. therefore, when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza is passionately fond of a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan Region.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and the region is still busy with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo daily documented the progress achieved in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had sparked the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a prefecture in Japan's northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring islands Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, as the tsunami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare-homes were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed here.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the disaster, the evacuation of accommodation establishments, evacuated by accommodation, could be relocated to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster, almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 more than 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the people who evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 were still living in emergency shelters whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees who lived in homes after the disaster were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1,100 schools affected by disaster have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fisheries "ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation, only 30 percent of the fisheries" ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land by Fukushima lie in the "nuclear proliferation zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recuperated, but Fukushima is still lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain a complete picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation centres. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how her empathy with the tsunami-risk has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that hasn't been done enough in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Some 75,000 people from Fukushima were displaced in areas outside the prefecture by 160,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 status, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation centres are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima need to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people from other countries meet, who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater at first than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, one often recognizes that one more combines than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global links. in our Into the Deep podcast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members, who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Ehuman explains how the love of music has strengthened its affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has gathered in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer hit him with a stick against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. across the country, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and moved him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>

<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio had been suspended from active service until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in Goiânia (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Uncharted Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on a Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After laying down, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory lost its facilities gradually until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive him of his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are in operation again because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene seems to have heard exactly that in Mañalam I would get the sugar cane mill, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for calming the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the congregation saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again some decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 cent per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural Prospectives" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "said the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories came to a halt, with more than 65 million people receiving their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane mill Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeats most," "" "Scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of birth, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">Officially composed documents were distinguished only concerning the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister was able to approve every removal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers still operating in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he was building.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important worktop producer has been extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives were created for the jobs and services that the systems generated in the congregations in which they were located.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane mill closed, or rather than they began to unmask, they also stopped to asphalve the road, this disadvantaged also other farms.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with the permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities all over Canada concern themselves with themes that are important to them. they do so using Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, since 2014 workshop leaders bring mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and joined North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus enters into discussions on topics such as "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the State of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the KitSummonum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in West Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters are not always proficient in the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-Group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as is a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if no one ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and as well as our youth go forward</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what the Creator has ordained for.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary, the reader and supporters of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to syllname (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (for the most part, "plastic models of dishes") are displayed by any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the death district of Kappabashi there are a multitude of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend is turning them into striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin zpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in a special sale: new plastic ribbons decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were turned into kitschy gatherings, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for your mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile stand and cell phone designers will allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">There are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other scurrile plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the mischief and killed appear on a regular basis only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of Sinaloa cartels, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict to the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looking at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking"), which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were engaged in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensational journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass the newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from experts.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people listen to songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the boundlessness of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by being" "" "soaked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to argue that they are spared from such tragedies if they do not stir and are still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the entry "Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family with threats was pillaged." in this she describes how armed criminals were squeezing money from their business month by month, until they had torn apart the business in the end, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact ourselves if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, as you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these awful days I wondered if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation committed by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was overthrown by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizen's Council for Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office had 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal Político founded the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the year after something has appeared the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to image tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">It raises questions about our desire for images on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the village of Sange in the east of DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died there.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated it. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of homes, including a movie theater near which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charded corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident portray the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charded bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was taken over several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote island of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses have reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were found in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated by satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from DR Congo appeared again when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has been documenting access to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further personal comments such as this example falsely relates the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which falsely claimed in 2012 that the President of Myanmar's Thein Being said that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations named AFP as their source also falsely attributed Thein to being this statement, but had not related the image from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The global reach of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false declines date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">An "reverse image search" enables you to see how far information can transcend boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverse picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion images (as of 3 May 2017), which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixing mask of private pages, social media platforms and community and national publications and are available in many different languages including English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to major discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of the Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and diminish the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been comprehensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes these images even are demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images sensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study examining how violent media are working on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent accounts in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which a picture suggests something which can actually be used from the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every investigation of false attributions should also take into account how internationally it can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. unremovable) endeavours to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (e.g. the Spanish Sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's tax-clap language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - take care of your parents in recognition of how they have taken care of you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness you feel after getting warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze and classify the world around us, the linguists on this site want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive are these little languages.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They defigured me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different kind. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims who do not fit into it, Muslims are abducted.</seg>

<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadowed the reality of nine Muslim women in the last three decades, while the United States did not even elect their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi-Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1032">This narrative has staffed our collective imagination so deeply and flawlessly that often Sikh men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the tune of 1.7 billion</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narratives that help us to understand the world.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be any way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the invaluable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and honor the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while listening to" "" "listening" "" "often means" "" "to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listening, to appreciate, to make sense." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers insert their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and presentation lead to the audience getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassiduou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamikara tells the tale of the Rabbit and the Baboon in the Shona language:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his fables, John Nyeffara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend it. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling presentations.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debts of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march launched at the capitol Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the neural exam of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of retaining debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their requirement:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missed for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, hosted in Berlin, an event hosted by the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is available free of charge, contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what is the real cost with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was taken out of the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us begin thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police had taken Bassel on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military tribunal in his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented himself as the insider of the Assad administration and who were informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at present the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the cultural prototypes was foreseeable than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of many civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merges with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he started working, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip of strife in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project up until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting, a rehearsal that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption case in which a government member after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state machine where corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants due to misappropriation of 54 million metics (about 800,000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose council has ruled Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with the opinion of the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to refer to his old post as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), a local institution supporting public transparency, condemned the company's decision to recharge the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary action against the counter-traded.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, apparently kept and instituted no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "opper" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be an advisor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be re-integrated into the company he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any moral authority:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that already insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza fails to return to morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only be remembered by the Mozambians as the first independent president, but also as sharp, incisive, and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censuses the word "Kalar" or, for all, allways (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically produce hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored in order to express their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written in Burmese 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'kalar pae' (splitting bse), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookier Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was extinguished today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">But he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook needs to be more analytic before breaking all the posts that were suspected of being racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "kalar pae" (splits).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech are getting a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to share his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to pay, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "didn't comply with the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed many posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work like that.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like "chair" or "inheritance curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely resolved posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech but were nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Burmese Text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post states" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is said to increase violence in communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where clashes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to take control of the usurious hate speech on its Burmese sites.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'kalar' it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code-concentrating initiatives and learn from them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page in English was presented on 18 January 2012, in contradistinction to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey has been blocking popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resisting the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology-savvy internet users are used to using wrapping tools for blocked web pages (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia in 2008, as recently published in a published report of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular internet blockages have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second best known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (thus machine calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is noteworthy, despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS talks about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we tried everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents in decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar irrorsites, when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as employees at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses to a different URL that is not the original. that which one can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly in Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to crunch pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to co-operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he was standing before [him] face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the sheep's opinion in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, mostly staying in a tent to shoot at the Bardia National Park footage of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of social pressure, they must respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, get this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted by an Indian state, Odisha, and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married kin with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also widespread among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all those, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and quickly became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the Video Volunteers community and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">"" "" "" "Rohini Pac has been working with her video camera for seven years at the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS-infected individuals, and manages these clubs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who do not name their husbands by their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not speaking out loud for the names of their husbands is a custom that they are dutiful and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "at the beginning," "" "Rohini" "", "who has never named her husband by name, wanted to try at home as it is." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband stayed for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in his luggage, Rohini launched her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the names of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paste from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women can never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only giggle before himself during the whole exercise; another decided to let out the entire frustration of him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenalin rush to have broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law gazed at her she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead, which indicates the status of the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry about who can hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their life they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them it's okay, but some wanted to wear a saline-cta, a wide shirt over a pair of pants; they did not trust themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes, morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped talking to her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viola for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate stream.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a sacrifice of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, said the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men have been registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government has developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who are going to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique, bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritualistic attacks, warned the Mozambican police according to the latest murder of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Millet, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hushed Algy Adamo, student and inhabitant of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said the local police were already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and assassination of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, this also draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in mind (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair fallout problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty which Mozambique faces:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 to Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (endangering the state) after he had participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto called for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as "an internal affair," and a spokesman tells us that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China still maintains calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to permit him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised several reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations Educational Talks</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and the world</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brenden refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government made it clear that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as she announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to elevate all limitations of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans "wish him that he has the possibility of treating abroad in so far as he can help him in his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the embassy asks the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy requested an angry response from China, with the Foreign Ministry statement that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"" "" "" "protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice on which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources were reported in Beijing by the news agency Reuters, that China had great concerns whether the vortex of Liu might overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to worry about his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu Advocate told AFP that Liu's wife Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to say:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression and freedom of expression." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In a statement on 29 June, France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually take it up.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Museum and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the Festival Affairs in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Liu and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in a statement on June 28 about Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius Well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the International branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice of "turning the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from those responsible, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries," in view of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old Lyre comes up from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the distorted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, during the last week of Shanmugam, answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised relevant questions with non-answers in a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said," "" "Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this, associates right and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks down the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Herr Shanmugam have committed a mistake or was it a Freudian Speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singaporeans afford their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have been annoyed by many Singaporeans...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice hockey, Nature." many Canadians might be wary of anger if they are held for Americans, but I don't bother about that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video released by the Junta, which took power in 2014, and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video of the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,254 times divided and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may relate to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives absolute decision-making on important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious programme of" "" "changing the settings" "" "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people viewed by the Junta as critics." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest militants and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosecute persons accused of leveraging the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict law against "read Majeste" (Majestic).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that purchasing is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video shows how people are thrown into a black van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured ear rings in teddy bear-form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - there are still hundreds of African and Haitian migrants coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, people come to the full little busses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mummy Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, they buy them medication, which they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to normally make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money necessary to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he responds with a smile." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">MS Ramírez recounts that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">MS Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>

<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single traveller, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the travellers consult their telephones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">MS Ramírez appears happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi were given a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication it is said that the app" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app to fight terrorism for more than ever.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged news with a private weavchat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police said that the app would identify and track down the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often bleak for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (as well), the censored news published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen accidentally checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are being discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest wax technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (BTW.) also released a Jingwang product description from which it emerges that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a decree with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a whole series of other possible crime rates, including those related to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2058">"" "he starts a" "" "pleasant" "" "conversation, despite the facial expressions that derail him:" "" "my boy, you are still young, you can do so much more important with your life than to join those Tagedieben and to protest on demonstrations that will soon end anyway." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to not responding.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't say exactly when insults and punches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I did not have done anything to deserve this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">On penalty in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him, so they exchanged the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator used to work as a refuse collector or if it belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them switched off while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I ceased to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling and didn't like it, which is why he went next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed my whole body enough to supply my entire neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he shuffles to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and then back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the highest floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as feluyees (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are relevant not only in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking and, according to his own statement, can sympathize with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special tendency towards American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib views his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so because of my own circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he added:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he shook water in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot day's day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things like drinking water in the public during the Ramadan, not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Ministry of the Interior Jordaniens announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the corporate statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MPs and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of the scary's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism which will question the old-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to choose "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simple rhetoric, but actually reflects an ever-growing reality in Jordan, which clearly manifests itself in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib promoted traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs extend up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the last few years, the number of 'Honorary-mordes' has been accepted in Jordan - the unofficial externally left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary positions reached its peak in 2016; however, it is further aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the fight against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be kept in prison indefinitely," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee of the family are often necessary that the woman will not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects which in his country long considered taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but concedes that he cannot divorce his music, which is full of explicit promises of sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come out of the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been tricked," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song repeating a verse often repeats:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which you, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that barely anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember later that his comments were torn, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "it was uploaded on Youtube without cuts, but streamed only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly advocates the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who later was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, arguing that they had voiced criticism on social media commentaries on issues linked to deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, reasoned and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced cracies. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory states that the fortresses, the drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years, and from a time in which armies from west Japan moved to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to pick some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital city, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Seldom outward appearances and body care were so important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate occupation like the hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 revealed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, experiences rising demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles by famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more normal citizens entering the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts will compete against each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and receive training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine" "" "Tea After Twelve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled, to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la cumliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: Revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the Peace Treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombians there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a rhetoric of war, and around the clock had their weapons in their hands, now have to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every guerrilla fighter who is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most of them.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC soldiers who will now find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I would never have thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters in person.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC acted as they had done before to receive orders from their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness and all that lies in between," said Manuela Jiménez Avila, political science student.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed lay a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Palace.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never in my life has someone written such a beautiful thing to me, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran on me over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and placed me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war too, it was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the outset, students and some FARC leaders joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has worked out on the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and recognizing that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">For example, Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Jesús Monsalve, the archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">"" "" "" "the Colombians have been prophesied that peace would reign after disarming." ""</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people ready to pick up arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all advocates of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OOC Media: in which health wings you have been placed - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having respect with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya in order to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They ordered absurd demands: some said to me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozy and say that I didn't change my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have told on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family manage to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time, I realized that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OK Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering me, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I inserted the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the gender equality, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When chatting with camera, I actually try to look at how the person looks at them from their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been in argun for a month and a half.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not exclude a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">This is what I mean, they probably charge relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OK Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there's not too many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relative or who were dropped by their relatives to make Cadyrov's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are captured there so that they can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked some village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for a month and a half.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was there even when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits but there were no reports about this yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I wore my hair always long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to introduce us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but eventually thrown us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">How is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, bore tubes and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defense of Sharia has never crossed my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say it to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OK Media: so they just shut their eyes off you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">How long did this Gnadenszeit last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov resigned.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he became prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed at before looked at you once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise tea riffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not miss a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I klapperated the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddebug?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Nature is so, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to make you know with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestanes have those who have Kabardinian which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transient to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not really sad because of that - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a sharp rise in suicide since the last few months.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi group in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to arise, so Ahrazi human rights groups who would like to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube gave the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to Taleghani Hospital in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August in the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Folah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all fathers of the family who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on the grounds of persecution by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where much of the Arab Ahrazi-community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to maintain their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab forefather was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the wealthiest and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, starvation and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only managed to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm-industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youth has now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and have 45% university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohihimi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist headquartered in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mix of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahraz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Because functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities across all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahrazi and be hired as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi has to endure, human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreatable depression.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. added by: Pixabay. published in the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even suggest well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men despite equal education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms ensure that women sooner or later meet a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware of me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination; if I mention the way we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists have been silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "raise their voices and" singing Kumbaya, my Lord "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence, which we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often are referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, which relate both to gender and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an unmended and marginalized being in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that, through cultural appropriation, absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin colour and gender, because some of them will continue to be silent about the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word feminism is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to fully isolate myself from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and status as a woman, rather than using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: recall (example: Africa-Womanismus: as we recapture ourselves), we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped who make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement that affects the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm on account of my dark skin and on account of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment in which my life is neither ignored nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" of Corpus. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin), which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship there was some time passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena pointed out because of abuse, the official display of Ada Báez also took advantage of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman returned her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women reimburse ads at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women admit to be victims of violence, to report to prosecution authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contentment 1 Beaches and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that nothing under-dimmt3 Paraguayan laws: good base, inadequate implementation hits and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are different statements and reports which, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay" explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 indicators of domestic violence were reported to the District Attorney Office. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women's ads came here too.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women said of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want it, but then still gave up. this should be regrettable for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too miserable because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the Paraguay authorities in order to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse." ""</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill of law was discussed at the Paraguayan Parliament which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Luxe).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiunaMenos (# NonReeLess) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Feminid will lead to an independent criminal record and to punish the harsher as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the text of the law changed in some respects to also win the deputies for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions was denied, which is currently banned in Paraguay and punishable with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to cost the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs that the victims of violence have to bear on their own, if they just want to pay a complaint and want to receive a safe accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">In view of these facts, the perpetrators are complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are offended.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to reimburse for such a long time until mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan senate. previously, parts of the law had been modified. among other things, a passage was cancelled, which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he is serving a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and put to trial, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having deposited his father, Said ibn Taimur, through a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he has held the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The sultan's rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, restricting public freedoms, including press freedom, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to intimidate and detract.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists from expressing their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>

<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times press freedom has been violated.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other violations include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper to stop its operation.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere in the poorest countries of Africa, and lack of investment in research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for the Research of Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic showed serious consequences for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he researched the HIV virus itself before deciding to go back home in order to support the Samba health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sambian National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">CC: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipients instead of being themselves creators.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">CC: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">CC: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">CC: how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">CC: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outstanding Gorgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has only been limited by his own imagination and the question of how many sorts of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only valid for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance to disease, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or cartel varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food security are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still growing salad, but it needs to be longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like lying in a river a boulder that I have to mate." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go far too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented. "he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement growing in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red roman lettuce of the "Greenhouse" variety in the "Greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seed to breed their own varieties, and not immediately cut it out - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds therefore play a role in larger contexts, such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability," he says and takes control of increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples are the combinations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, which are being offered in farmers markets for example, should also know that the manner in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains free, as opposed to patented seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo taken by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartel features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only complicit.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet available, but experts such as Luby suspect that plants that are grown naturally like wheat are still more patented than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated in such a way that they have purposefully desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves as far as such, due to which they prosper in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is far more necessary than ever since the modified conditions are much more likely to be predicted by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also vital for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts the view that intellectual property is in possession of other breeders as "patents and the protection of plant varietets promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not prevent innovation, it encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not support innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to facilitate their work." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant features:" "" "we do not really create the features ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppes, Plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi Management Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety, also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce herbicides, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exact opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they hold it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am stronger than companies with my efforts to produce new products.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition, which makes it very easy to do with my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">"" "although the US seems to be a leader in the" "" "open source" "" "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open-source" seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre collaborates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol works on an "open source" license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeders differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot simply be joined one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>

<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for "open source" seed systems for Hivos, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems, which should be the official start of the official launch next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 5th of August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains consistent despite this attack and the mocking of Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">It is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network originating from Qatar because of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of web side closures fell victim. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Zida used his blog for the prevalence of articles and articles that he writes for websites and media that are inaccessible to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which Zigiadas blog is given a home, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video showing how the police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziadah expressed himself about the government's blockage and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs, as well as any other web page for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the locking of providers through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages offered by VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users may have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the reasoning decisions are being made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed to court against these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Newspapers from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives, report day after day newspapers all over Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot in school," "On the second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "thieves smokes pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers from the army, navy and air to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violence wave reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "so the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio" "" "Extra" "" "on August 16 published the editorials" "" "This is not normal," "" "in which she announced to establish a new column called" "" "war in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">It will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world, such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to information from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 territories controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to retouch atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it does?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war." in her opinion, this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police officer.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of the public sector.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To commemorate: the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro says: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by using a massive police bloc and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. but after several years, the UPP was increasingly becoming increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities intended to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux was quoted from an article published in 2010 explaining why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention as a "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war. this includes intrusion into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police came up with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident caused headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the ensuing civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, in Damascus and the surrounding area, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Particularly affected is the region east of Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which led to local inhabitants to rely locally or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the many years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged Eastern Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the Project, Abo Nabil, told the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to raise money for the initiative, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is in agreement with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">According to Dr. Leila, it is planned to teach 125 families to plant fungi, as Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about 12,700 €, but will continue to raise donations to CanDo until Monday, 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began with the" "" "production of mushrooms from the regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the government to last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European Forestry Monitoring System, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the Lisbon region.</seg>

<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of Civil Defence of Portugal on 15th and 16th October, when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used its own civilian protection data with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little reward and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar that were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "remembered Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows to prevent us from freezing at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf dismissed his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high ratings, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, "the system" suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum, which can still withdraw for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so did Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his immortal will helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his total savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while, he opened a second hostel and a fast snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "after Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In 2017, the film won the Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, several Afghan-powered companies, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have emerged.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea for his Restaurant Oriental Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharafs targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also plans plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearance of the camp of Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo taken by @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, wins and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register in order to use the social networks within six months of the successful decision of the law on the authority's website, stating their full name and identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months or a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been promoted by sixty-five members of the Parliament, is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another deputy presented a legislative proposal in which harsher penalties for the insult of the president or high officials would be introduced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, such an act would be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may be up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underline a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while fighting violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">After four years in prison, Shawkan was waiting four years in prison for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed for 20 May because the prison leadership according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan faces the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups are unanimous, among other things arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi's blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogated Tunisian activists on leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has been largely interrogated to a sophisticated action plan. according to the plan, the President of the Republic, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill supporting businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April casts a light on how the presidential plans for the support of the legislation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia flatly rejected the attribution of his sources under the guidance of Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, assuring journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force social media users to submit their identification document?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, it is stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that by this the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat, in the state government, failed to register as an" "" "organizer of information distribution." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that "organize" the publication of the information. "the law also allows the government to take responsibility for the removal of content and force it upon request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoblniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the mail service Mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias blockage</seg>
<seg id="2964">Turkish court ordered Wikipedias locking in Turkey after Wikipedia admins have refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website, including China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">United Kingdom can't stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a deliberate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install malware programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation still runs until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
