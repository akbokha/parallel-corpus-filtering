This is James Risen.
You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.
Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to phones by Americans.
But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA surrendered to Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.
If this sounds crazy, read it.
It's an incredible story.
But do you know who the chapter didn't like?
The U.S. government.
For nearly 10 years, the government has been investigating cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources.
In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.
According to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information.
But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give.
So when the government leaked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.
From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived at the risk of going to prison.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, although they were indications that it would be essential in their case, the government's demands were dropped on breaches.
The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.
Instead of shutting and splitting to make statements, it could also do his digital footprints for him.
And so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his telephone conversations secret,
Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit, and even travel warnings with the list of his flights.
In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.
Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.
President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.
Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their work as secret.
Since September 11 almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.
So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitution, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone.
"" "" "" "but just as technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources." ""
They can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.
Today there is communication software that didn't exist yet when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.
Such a technology is SecureAnywhere, an open source system for whistleblowers that was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.
Instead of sending an email, go to a news site like the Washington Post.
There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form.
These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access.
So the government cannot secretly procure information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.
SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize us all.
It is important to ensure that not only technology owners, such as Edward Snowden, have the opportunity to mislead offenders. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,
Who knows about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, who alarm the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street Insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis.
"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crime but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""
Thank you.
[the "Panama Papers" revealed that the rich and powerful] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.
We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"
We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.
This has already led to very direct consequences.
Iceland's prime minister has resigned.
There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox firms in tax havens.
It is claimed that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.
Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.
Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or John-Grisham-novel.
It seems to be far away from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should that come to us?
But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.
And this concerns all of us.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, will be used by a few to hide and obscure their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.
I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.
I always imagine a matryoschkapuppe.
So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.
Presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations, this scandal.
Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.
But due to the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.
If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.
In fact, in some U.S. states, less information is needed to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card.
This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees from school districts to rip off school children.
It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.
It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.
Here with Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.
How does it work?
So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.
Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.
"" "" "" "we really shocked the fact that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money." ""
None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system.
It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.
"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator." ""
"" "" "" "it's not about a single top policeman wrapped up in a scandal." ""
It is about how the system works, where corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established.
And in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.
"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult." ""
It may sound so dim as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.
But as a born optimist I can see that a lot has started to change.
"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen pushing for greater transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""
The theme found political alertness by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.
Since then, the EU registers in central registers on a national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it.
One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.
Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary groups, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.
We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.
For us with Global Witness this is a moment for change.
"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies." ""
"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of transparency by law." ""
"" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""
This is the story that I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.
One day after completing my design studies, I made a sale of the back yard.
A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.
He bought one of my works of art.
He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.
I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.
It was late. I got tired.
"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""
"" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""
And I thought, "Oh, man!
What do I do now? "
Who doesn't know the situation?
Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?
But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!
This is a small trunk!
"" "then I heard say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""
"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, as please?" "" "" ""
"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get in there?" ""
A stranger sleeps in my living room.
What if he's crazy? "
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed, sneaking on my toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.
But he was not crazy at all.
We are still in touch.
The artwork he bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.
This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.
Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?
To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.
Let's take a skip, two years later...
I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased.
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.
I believe creativity can make it turn fear into fun.
I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and breakfast each morning.
Ha! "
We created a website and thus created "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.
They found it super, and we too.
I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.
We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.
Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent?
Things were rolling.
My former roommate, Nate Blepharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept from it.
This is how we presented investors: "we want to create a website where people post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.
Via the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them.
That will be the next big thing! "
We were waiting for the missile to be lit.
But they do not.
No one who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.
Why?
Because we, as children, have learned that strangers are dangerous.
If you have a problem, you are thinking about the things that you can do well. we could design.
At the Academy of Fine Arts we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.
Can design afford something like that?
Is it possible to create trust with design?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we entrenched.
It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.
Thumbs up when you are ready.
Take your mobile phone into your hand.
Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.
Enter your locked mobile phone with your left seat neighbour.
This silent flight of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.
Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.
Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?
Most people feel the responsibility.
This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.
Only for this reason can our company exist.
Only so, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?
Could you please tell Twitter that he is candidding for the President's office?
You can now return the mobile phones back.
You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.
What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?
What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he told you where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?
Imagine you would have 150 assessments, all of which say: "he can really keep very well-locked mobile phones!"
How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?
A well thought-out feedback system improves confidence.
In the beginning we did some things wrong.
It was hard for the people to give off negative judgements.
Finally, we decided to wait until both the host and the guest left their assessments before we put them online.
Last week we discovered something new.
We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust one another, depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.
Not surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.
If you have less than three convictions, nothing changes.
But if you have more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation assimilates similarities.
The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.
In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you pay off.
Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.
"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""
"" "tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request will not be accepted." ""
"" "so there is an optimum degree of openness, e.g." "" "great works of art in your apartment! I make holidays with my family." "" "" ""
How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?
We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.
Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.
What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.
Here you see how many people use our offer.
You can see three things.
First: incredible good luck.
Second, the tireless work of our team.
Thirdly, a demand that had not been met before.
The business is running very well for us.
Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.
There were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate parties or ravaged apartments.
Hosts have left guests in the rain.
At the beginning of the project I worked on my customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.
There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.
The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.
Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays only one fraction may have a problem.
For people trust one another rightly.
When trust works, wonderful things can arise.
One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even donated blood for the necessary operation!
Here is his assessment:
"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""
The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, although they don't know one at all.
You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.
They leave one even longer without charging the extra nights.
I can only recommend it! "
Of course, not every stay does not work.
But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the sharing economy.
When I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:
How does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions fit together?
This is an economic transaction.
"" "but now simply call it" "" "rental industry" "" "does not do justice to the thing." ""
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.
People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.
When you travel today, you can compare fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.
But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?
What if in any place you were visiting, a group of residents would wait to fill it thoroughly and to show you a quarter of a pub you've never heard before;
Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?
Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.
What if we would create apartments for the sake of sharing?
What would that look like?
What if cities would take the thought of joint participation?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.
In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun.
Were offered to residents now. students who were looking for a place to stay,
Were taught to people whose children were moved out. incubator programmes were initiated,
In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.
So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.
We didn't reinvent the wheel.
Hospitality also existed before.
There were already similar websites before us.
So why exactly did our work?
Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.
Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.
I find it amazing,
Almost overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.
We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.
But if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we can use in the near future.
Thank you.
What do you think when you look at me?
A believer? an expert?
Maybe even a sister.
Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?
Or simply a delay in the airport security check.
This is indeed true.
I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.
That's how the media are people who look like me.
A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.
Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.
Presumably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.
For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.
I tell you who I am.
I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.
I am introverted,
A Wannabe-Fitness-Fanatikerin,
And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.
But not like Lady Gaga singing, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.
I decided to do this.
When I was 17 years old, I decided to outen me.
No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.
"" "my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "" "why are you suppressing yourself?" "" "" ""
The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.
I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.
I have wrestled with the Qur'an.
I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and finally believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
It was trust and slow devotion, deepening with every reading of the Qur'an.
The beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry.
I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever felt that someone you perceive you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?
That is how it feels.
Later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.
"" "later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream" "". "" ""
Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.
I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."
There was smoke, planes flying into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical malfunction?
My shock quickly turned into outrage.
Why should you do something like that?
I changed the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..." "... in the name of Islam..."... "Middle East..."... "..."... "bombed Mecca!"
Oh my God.
It was not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect.
On the same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start with postgraduate studies.
I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I feared for the first time to be recognized as Muslims.
We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.
And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said: "be alert," "Be careful," "Stay in well lit areas," "Don't mess."
I stayed indoors all week.
Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims assemble for prayer.
"" "and again the warnings watched:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""
I saw the extensive reporting.
The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims, dragged and struck.
There were really surf attacks on mosques.
I thought: we should stay at home.
But something did not feel right.
Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.
"" "" "" "I have turned the anger of the people on the terrorists." ""
Imagine! I was angry as well.
It is not easy to constantly assert itself.
I have nothing against any questions, I love questions.
It is the accusations that are hard.
"" "today, we can actually hear people say," "" "There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""
When will we get rid of them? "
Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.
They speak of my church like a tumor in the US's body.
Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?
You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour can only be observed under observation.
The alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrong.
Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.
Thank you!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic champions.
Will the closure of mosques America make America safer?
There may be a few parking places free, but do not stop terror.
The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.
And as I recently told a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.
They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.
When it comes to the radicalization process, it has been established that it starts online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists may make a brainwashing that leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or fallen away from faith.
If we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.
As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.
But we would add to their imaginations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thank you!
The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.
"" "both groups claim their ideology on their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""
"" "but when one looks at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""
It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.
An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:
A girl came to him because she prefers to join the IS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.
Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised their solution.
This imam restored the connection to God and its church.
Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque she saved from joining the IS.
This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect everyone else?
How does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, our freedom of thought?
One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.
We are more accepting an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice.
A study shows that if you read news reports that have been reported negatively by Muslims, they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.
This is not just a academic problem.
If you look at the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.
It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.
So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism as I expected.
It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.
Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.
We might feel it first, but the toxic air of fear bathes us all.
When assigning collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain to themselves.
Deh and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was at the dental Faculty, talented, promising...
His sister would tell me he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:
"" "" "" "when did my brother become such an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""
Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, as well as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her home, as in a execution after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.
He shot at Deh eight times.
Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after 9 / 11?
Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?
We discussed it and there was no easy decision for us, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.
We chose the mosque.
With our son in the child's seat we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.
I took it out, put off my shoes, walked into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.
At that moment I broke down.
These people were there because they had withdrew courage and compassion from panic and prejudice.
What will you choose?
What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?
Will you go on number safe?
Or will you join those who think: we are better than yours.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much!
Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.
But I wonder what do you say to those who might say you're holding a TEDTalk, a mindset with deep down, working in a classy think tank, so an exception and not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.
I am no exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am as ordinary as it is allowed.
Looking at Muslims around the world, and I did so with the biggest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.
So I am in no way an exception.
If people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.
HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.
What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion-dollar business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones.
Before sending air-parcels into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.
By connecting flights, air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.
You can also build up independently loadable structures.
They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.
Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.
Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight.
In order for a system to operate autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in space.
In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.
There are no external cameras.
Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculate calculations on board what the machine should do.
"" "external commands are available at the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""
This is a so-called rear starter,
A flight device trying to beat two flies with one flap.
Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.
In contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.
However, there is always one downside.
A limitation of stern-starters is that they react sensitively to turmoil like wind gusts.
We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.
The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter what location the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.
Okay. okay.
During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.
One such question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moveable parts that meet to hurt you.
Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two moveable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.
Recently we discovered that flying with just one thing works.
This is the monospist, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.
It has only one movable part, one propeller,
No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, so that it can fly stable, and can move everywhere in the room.
Nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to bring it to flight, I have to throw it exactly right.
The likelihood of throwing it right when everyone is watching is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.
When the monospist is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is an exercise in abundance here, the bus with its eight propellers.
What to do with all this overflow?
They see that it is very symmetric.
That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.
Thus it receives the extraordinary ability,
Moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even as it rotates.
Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive flows of the eight propellers.
Some can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.
Let's look at that.
When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.
This machine is made up of two separate two propeller planes.
This turns clockwise
And the other counter-clockwise.
When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.
But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit restricted.
We will now demonstrate this by making one half flightless.
The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.
We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.
Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.
Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.
The most secure machine on Broadway wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.
For guys like us, wages are in development and creative act.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, wise creations to form them in such a spectacular way.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.
Thank you very much.
1.3 billion years ago, two black holes were orbiting each other in a very far distant galaxy, transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For this short moment, they lit up brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.
It was a very big bang.
But they did not put their energy in the form of light --
We finally speak of black holes.
The entire energy was released into the space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.
Let us arrange the events at first.
Just 1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on the earth.
Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet.
About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.
Most of them thought they were crazy.
But enough people recognised them as mad geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.
After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometric gravitational-shaft observatory.
In the following years, the precision of Ligo could be substantially increased, which significantly improved recognition performance.
Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.
In early September 2015 Ligo was launched for a last trial to clarify some minor persistent issues.
On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the detachment of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes disappeared through the earth.
They went through you and me
And also through the detector.
Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:
The birth of my daughter
"" "" "" "and the farewell from my sick father." ""
Basically these were the fruits of my life.
AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes and their signals measurable by observatories like Ligo for 23 years. what are gravitational-waves?
A wave of gravitation is a contraction in the structure of space and time.
When the shaft is moved forward, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other.
For illustration, lecturers often perform a properly albery dance in courses to relativity theory.
"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."
The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.
On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched out and smoked when the waves were hit. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.
That is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. that's why one explained the Ligo staff for crazy.
With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus.
At the end of his classic text about gravitation
"" "said Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such a metal detector are enormous." ""
"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""
Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.
Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.
I would like to explain what this means.
Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.
This is quite convenient, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.
It is different with sounds.
Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:
For example, the face of your child.
Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to make the story behind it.
"" "" "" "now, Alice is talking." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "and Bob breaks it." "" "" ""
"stupid Bob."
The same applies to gravitational-waves.
We can't make simple pictures of objects in space with them.
But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.
At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.
So if we transmute wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.
To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working very long.
SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just circular: wupp!
If the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same cycle with an additional key change. it sounds like this: Wu-wu-Yiwu-Yiwu-Yiwu!
It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.
AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender sounds] No one who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.
AA: let's think about what this means.
Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle one hundred times per second before they collide.
Imagine these forces.
Fantastic.
And we know of it because we heard it.
This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.
Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before.
On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the unseen.
We can't see much in space -- virtually or principally -- not.
A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.
They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe from them.
But the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.
We will never see through since they are opaque.
Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.
With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.
And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.
In fact, in the first attempt, Ligo found things that we had not expected.
My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the suckers for our archaeological work so to speak.
Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view on what is happening in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.
AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.
Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and the chirp of the cosmos.
We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.
For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?
Now is the time of great dreams.
Do you dream with us?
Thank you.
Some time ago I experimented with an experiment.
"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes" "" "to everything I was afraid of." ""
"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "Yes" "". "" ""
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes!
Did I want to be on TV live?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start playing?
No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of getting rid of my fear.
My fear to speak, my social anxiety -- puff, away.
The power of a word is impressive.
"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed my life." ""
"yes" changed me.
But there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected. it began with a question of my little ones.
"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "" "for inexplicable reasons," ""
As if she were a waitress from the south.
"kittens, I need milk for my beak cup."
"" "she asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""
This yes was the beginning
From then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.
It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.
But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" -say to play with my children saved my career.
I have a real dream job.
I am a writer. I think things out, awaken you to life.
Dream job.
No.
I am a Titan.
Dream job.
I created television. I produce television.
I make television, in a great style.
In this TV season I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program to the world.
Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.
Each consignment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.
The budget for an episode of a TV broadcaster may be between three and six million dollars.
Let us say five.
A new episode nine days by four shows, all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programmes, 70 hours of TV, three shows simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,
350 million dollars for a season.
In America, my TV series are running successively on Thursday evening.
All over the world, my series in 256 regions run into 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programs I created myself, and not just produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories.
Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.
Do you know who else does that?
No one, so I am a Titan.
Dream job.
I don't want to impress you with that.
I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.
I tell you, so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are managing a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I am not just typing on the computer and fanciful, and it is true when I say that it's not dreaming about a dream job.
It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.
I work a lot, hard and I love it.
When I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.
My work always creates a land out of nowhere.
It's as if I set up troops, as if I painted on a canvas.
As if you carry a high tone, run a marathon.
One feels like Beyoncé.
And all this at the same time.
I love to work.
It is creative, mechanical, exhausting, intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best part is the buzz.
There is such a change in me when the work is running well.
A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it.
Many people assume when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.
Don't understand me wrong, it does.
But the buzz -- when I began to work and work and make, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!
The buzz is more than writing.
The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.
The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.
The buzz is God's voice in my ear.
And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive differently from size.
The feeling of not being able to do otherwise than to strive for size, no matter what price.
This is called the buzz.
Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.
Perhaps it is called genius.
Perhaps it is called ego.
Perhaps it is the fear of failure.
I don't know.
I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.
I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.
In order to make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more the more episodes, the more things there are, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.
The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love work, isn't it?
The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.
I like this sums. I love the buzz.
I need the buzz. I am the buzz.
Am I just this sums?
And then the buzzing stopped.
Overloaded, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.
The buzz stopped.
Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single labour force.
Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."
"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-country." "" "" ""
It is the children of a Titans.
They are baby Titans.
They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing stopped.
The engine's buzz was silent.
I didn't love my work any more. the engine was off.
The buzz did not come back.
My buzz was broken.
I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing to delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever.
But there was no buzz.
In me was silence.
Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.
Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...
I was the perfect Titan.
I was a demonstration Titan,
Everything was grey, I just had no fun.
And that was my life.
All I did.
I was the buzz and the buzz I was.
So what do you do if what you are doing is suddenly fade away?
"" "I know some may think:" "" "Heul, stupid Author-Titan." "" "" ""
But you know you do, you do, you work, you love what you do, be a teacher, be a banker, a mother, be a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz you know when the buzz is stopped, who is you then?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a Titan?
When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?
"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""
"" "I am on the way outside, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""
And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:
"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" "" "kitten." "" "" ""
"" "she calls no one any more" "" "kitten." "" "" ""
When did this happen?
"" "" "" "I miss it when I'm Titan and I am fucking my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes." ""
"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""
And I say, "Yes."
There is nothing special about this.
"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""
Nothing extraordinary.
But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of money, I can't do anything except to fit.
I am focused.
I am silent.
The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.
All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons, and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl gets released in "The Ice Queen."
Peace and simplicity are everywhere.
The air at this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.
I can hardly believe that I breathe.
Playing is the opposite of work.
And I am happy.
Something in me dissolves.
A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.
And that's not right away, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The buzz is coming back slowly.
No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.
"" "" "" "not the buzz but a buzz." ""
And now I feel as if I know a magic secret.
But let's stay with the matter.
It is love. that's all.
No magic. no mystery. only love.
It is something we have forgotten.
The buzzing, the work-sum, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement.
If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of programmes and televisions and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.
The buzz is not a force and it is not work-specific.
It depends on the joy.
The real buzz is dependent on love.
The buzz is the current that comes from the zest of life.
True humming is self-confidence and peace.
The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.
The real buzz is simple and original.
The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me I am a titanium?
It's just love.
We all need a little more love, much more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.
It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice unless I want to hear the buzz again.
I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.
Playing doesn't seem to me as much as they work.
The truth is painful,
But I don't like playing it.
I always work because I love it.
I prefer to work at work than at home.
This admission is painful, because what kind of person does he prefer to be home?
Well, yes, I.
"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""
I have to have problems.
That I am too relaxed is none of it.
We race around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.
We make small dance parties,
We sing and play ball.
We crush bubbles.
At the same time, I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.
I always travel to my mobile phone.
But it is OK.
My children show me how to live and the buzz of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?
You can also say yes, if your child wants to play with you.
Perhaps you think me naive, for a daydreamer.
You're right, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.
Your child will find you less interesting than you think.
It is only 15 minutes.
My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.
It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.
And when my teenie daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I'm the mother of the year.
It is only 15 minutes, more it does not need.
Everyone can spend 15 minutes on a piece, even in a bad mood day!
15 minutes by piece!
No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.
The day is short: dinner, the children are ready for bed.
But 15 minutes are in it!
My children are my feelessness, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz, to have a place for peace of mind.
It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,
"" "in order to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""
Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!
Find out what you are doing well.
Find out and preserve it.
I'm not perfect in it. I won and I'll win. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --
"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""
15 minutes by piece, why not allow for full 15 minutes?
What can be wrong about it? nothing!
The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.
Working doesn't work without playing.
It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown tune, it fills me and my soul.
I like the buzz, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.
Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.
This is my sum.
The buzz of life.
The buzz of love.
The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part of it. and I am so grateful for that.
It's snuffed to me that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan that plays a trip to Jerusalem.
I said yes to less work and more games.
And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire still burns.
The more I play, the happier I and my children.
The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.
The more I play, the clearer is my head.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I created the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right hum: the buzz of life.
The more I feel the buzz, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new feeling of being in me is broadly. less titanium -- more I!
The more I feel the exact sums, the more I know who I am.
I am a writer. I think things out, I stir you to life.
This is part of the job, which means living his dream.
This is the dream of this job,
Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.
"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""
Titans have no chance here.
"do you want to play?"
Thank you very much.
I am neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.
For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing ability.
After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.
This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.
They certainly have heard of one of the best known, the "depth brain stimulation." thereby one implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.
It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.
Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-cure.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.
In my opinion, we approach this dream.
I would like to show you that we are very close to it.
With some help, the brain can help itself.
The story began 15 years ago.
At the time I was leading doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.
Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.
You have to imagine that skull-brain trauma shakes the brain and the cranial pressure increases.
To save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of cranial pressure.
Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.
Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.
What do I mean by this?
We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.
This is not an easy task.
Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.
You need to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.
That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts Jean-François managed to do this.
He saw it under his microscope.
That was a big surprise for us.
Why?
It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.
Perhaps you still know from biology training that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.
It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.
We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died.
So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved otherwise.
We needed long to understand where they came from.
They come from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brain.
They make up 4% of our cerebellum cattle.
They play a very important role in our development.
In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.
But why stay with us?
We don't know that.
We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.
But this is not so secure.
One thing is clear, however -- of these cells we received our stem cells.
We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.
We had to prove this.
So we decided to develop an experiment.
We wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non-linguistic field and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.
And then mark them in color to be able to pursue them in the brain.
In the last step we have re-imported them to the collection point of the same individual.
We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.
One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-integrate these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-integrate the same cells into damaged brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.
In the first scenario we re-imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home.
In the second scenario we had an injury and re-reimplantate exactly the same cells, and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up into mature neurons.
Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.
These are the cells that have been re-imported.
The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.
Of course we couldn't stop here.
Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.
They had to take food pellets from a tray.
They did it very well.
When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor-motor area in the motorised cortex.
As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.
Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.
The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkey.
When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.
On the left hand side they see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered.
It can generate about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.
It is not as precise and not as fast.
See now when we re-imported the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.
I can tell you that we were very exciting also for us.
Since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal themselves.
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."
I definitely.
Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.
Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.
BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.
JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.
BG: look to the future -- You have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look in the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.
JB: it's hard to say.
First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.
Will the authorities allow us to start soon?
Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.
It takes a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.
Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.
You have to prove first that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.
BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.
BG: thank you very much.
Democracy.
We in the West make a great mistake to consider them as self-evident.
We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.
We tend to look at them as immutable gedness.
We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
That is not true.
Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.
In fact, democracy disappears in us, in Europe.
At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs carried out in Greece.
At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaked friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.
At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.
I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group, succumb to a mistake, we could save us democracy, but that we need a genuine and defenceless democracy.
For without democracy, our societies will be bogged down, our future bleed and our great new technologies are wasted.
On the topic of extravagance I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.
"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox" "". "" ""
A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that throws his long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world.
We all know the mountain of debt,
But few recognize its twin.
A mountain of unused cash which belongs to the high net worth saving savers and corporations, but they are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity is desperately needed, for example "green" energy.
I call them two numbers.
Over the past three months, $3.4 trillion was invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.
$3.4 trillion will sound like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock markets and hug the real estate prices.
Debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.
The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that advocates the pessimism of investors, which, as in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, in which they do not invest.
Unintentionally, the circumstances cause the Oedipus to kill him.
This is my Hades with Capitalism --
"" "his extremely wasting art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and to finance all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial to the saving of the earth." ""
So is democracy the solution?
But before we continue, what do we understand under democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.
The Athenian democracy included too many --
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy based on these exclusions.
The decisive thing in the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working arms, and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech, but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political participation with the same vote of vote in questions of state matters.
The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted for a long time --
Like a candle that lights up very brightly, it is burnt out quickly.
However, our present-day liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,
But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.
While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.
For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.
In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an implacable struggle between the two takes place by gradually undermining policies and disempowering them.
Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?
It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.
It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power, because power is migrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.
I mentioned my Hades with Capitalism.
If you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores, who so sustainably decimated the animals of which they feed, that they are starving at the end.
Similar to the economy which has canniated politics so far that it is harming itself by the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations increases, political goods are being exploited, the inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.
The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.
If this is true, it is obvious that we have to reassemble politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" maintain control, just like in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.
By the way, this is not a new idea.
The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.
The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working oppressed return only through a miracle a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new ways of brutality and waste.
But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!
Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.
The problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin peaks become higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- to come in countries like China.
So we must reunite the economy and reunite the sectors of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a hospital-like hyper autocracy, which makes the film "matrix" appear as a documentary.
The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it produced --
The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to "Matrix" or something similar to "Star Trek," in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life.
I think we must be optimistic.
So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?
In practical implementation, I would like to give you, in brief, some examples.
In the area of companies: please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.
Then all income from capital and redemption and the concept of wage labor are completely overhauled.
No distinction between those whom the companies belong, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not belonging to the company. no more exchange between capital and labour, no great gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twins.
In the area of global political economy, please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.
Keep in mind that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- let us call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government is paying the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.
Imagine that this fund is investing in green technology, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.
This is not a new idea.
It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.
The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.
"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy." ""
The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which it favors privileged individuals, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.
But above all it is a world in which we can introduce a real democracy.
We will awaken in such a world
"" "or are we going to sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""
The answer depends on how we decide politically together.
It is in our hands and we do it more democratic.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis...
You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.
How relevant is Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.
The reason for the reunification of politics and business is... Do we do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers referred to as "long-term stagnation."
By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.
If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,
Like Hayek, that's why I am a Libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm totally confused.
BG: actually, and now we are.
YV: if you don't get confused you don't think enough.
BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West's view of China.
Would you like to repeat it here?
YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.
As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone.
In a certain sense, if I may say this as provocative, China is similar to the England of the nineteenth century.
Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically.
Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill -
He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.
What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.
Now to blame China for doing what the West has done in the nineteenth century itself smells great in hypocrisy.
BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.
YV: I guessed that this is coming.
BG: yes...
How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?
YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,
Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,
"" "" "" "that is to say goodbye to us, and the ongoing denial that a massive fault line proceeded through the eurozone, and continues to be massive threats to the development of the whole European Union." ""
We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --
"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continued to choose denial." ""
But you know what is coming.
This is the experience of the Soviet Union --
If you try to maintain an economic system that is not able to survive by political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but if the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.
BG: what changes do you anticipate?
YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.
BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?
YV: every day.
BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- Seriously...
If there is a Minister of Finance or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.
Of course I made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to sign the renewal of the debt programme at the end of February.
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the lenders to find a common solution.
But that did not exist.
They just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions circulating through the eurozone.
They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.
We lost a third of our nominal GDP.
"" "there is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""
"" "none of the financiers, who imposed this policy on us, admitted:" "" "that was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""
BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.
YV: absolutely.
"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""
My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.
For if it does not survive, the exposed pilots will be demonically and destroy the European Union.
This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
If we allow ourselves to embark on the journey of a post-modern in 1930, according to which it seems to me, it will be just as detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.
BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.
Yanis, thank you for being with TED.
YV: thank you.
Most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.
Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.
That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.
Roy Price is managing director at Amazon Studios,
The TV production company at Amazon.
"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelhorn and describes herself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technique, tacos." "" "" ""
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.
Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.
There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any.
He has to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve.
This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received.
If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.
Then you have a successful show.
These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive to where, after having watched a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"
This kind of show.
On the left, here at this end, there are shows like 'Toddlers and Tiaras' -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.
Roy Price is not worried about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."
He makes more thoughts about the average beaming, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.
So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.
The pressure is there, and of course it's also the first time Amazon does something, so Roy Price wants nothing to risk.
He wants to create success.
He needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.
He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch for free.
And if Amazon has released things for free, is it true?
Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.
However, they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.
They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.
You will see when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skipping over or watching again.
They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.
"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US Senators." "" "" ""
They did this show.
Does anybody know the name of this show?
Yes, Alpha House, but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.
It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve equals 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a little above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on.
About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but it makes it a bit different.
Instead of hosting a contest, he and his team watched the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give the shows their course, which shows they like, etc.
Then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.
When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.
"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.
Of course, the question is: what happened here?
One has two very competitive, data segregated companies.
They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.
What is this?
Because logic says it should work with everything.
If you collect millions of data, for a decision you have to make, you should make a good decision.
You have 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.
You optimize it by a very powerful computer.
The least what you can expect is good television, isn't it?
If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.
Does anyone know the multi-health system?
No one. OK, that's even good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this space. come in touch with it, you are in jail.
If someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether there is a dismissal or not.
Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.
Moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,
Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.
Even the most promising companies are wrong.
Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.
In 2009 Google announced that data analysis could precede outbreaks of flu, the awful species, through data analysis of Google searches.
"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great sensation sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""
It worked fine, year around year around year, until it didn't work any more,
And no one could say why.
"" "it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""
Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these errors, data becomes increasingly flowing into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.
So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.
I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy
Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.
If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:
First, disassemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a branch, you put the components together again in order to make a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.
And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.
They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.
There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.
If there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.
That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.
Amazon however did this in the wrong way.
They used data to control all their decisions first when they compete for TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.
"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say," "" "That's what the data says." "" "" ""
It did not lead to the desired result.
"" "" "" "data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions." ""
No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order to avoid forgetting this, this device is quite useful.
Many of you will...
Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.
Many know it.
"" "it's also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a hunting or no question, just shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""
I will find it later with a technique demo.
So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball in retrospect.
But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with a lot more sophisticated like data analysis to make better decisions.
But this does not change the basic structure.
Perhaps the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.
And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.
At the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.
Thank you very much.
