this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones by Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA sur@@ rendered to Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has been investigating cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give .
so when the government le@@ aked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived at the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they were indications that it would be essential in their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped on bre@@ aches .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of sh@@ utting and spl@@ itting to make statements , it could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his telephone conversations secret ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit , and even travel warnings with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitution , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just as technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist yet when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Anywhere , an open source system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers that was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot secretly proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it is important to ensure that not only technology owners , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have the opportunity to mis@@ lead offen@@ ders . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , who alarm the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street In@@ sider , who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crime but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that the rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panam@@ anian law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to be far away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that come to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some U.S. states , less information is needed to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees from school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here with Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked the fact that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top polic@@ eman wrapped up in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , where corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability are established .
and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound so dim as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I can see that a lot has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen pushing for greater transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political al@@ ert@@ ness by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU registers in central registers on a national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary groups , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of transparency by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story that I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after completing my design studies , I made a sale of the back yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , as please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed , sne@@ aking on my toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a skip , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate runs out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can make it turn fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and thus created &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ phar@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept from it .
this is how we presented investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
via the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile to be lit .
but they do not .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we , as children , have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are thinking about the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design afford something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we entr@@ en@@ ched .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your locked mobile phone with your left seat neighbour .
this silent flight of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
only so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
could you please tell Twitter that he is can@@ did@@ ding for the President &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones back .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he told you where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 assessments , all of which say : &quot; he can really keep very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system improves confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give off negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both the host and the guest left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three convic@@ tions , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation as@@ simil@@ ates simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you pay off .
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimum degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredible good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a demand that had not been met before .
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate parties or rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on my customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays only one fraction may have a problem .
for people trust one another rightly .
when trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , although they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they leave one even longer without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay does not work .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the sharing economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions fit together ?
this is an economic transaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not do justice to the thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you were visiting , a group of residents would wait to fill it thoroughly and to show you a quarter of a pub you &apos;ve never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments for the sake of sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun .
were offered to residents now . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were moved out . incu@@ b@@ ator programmes were initiated ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder what we can use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
presumably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a W@@ ann@@ abe @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you supp@@ ressing yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone you perceive you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that is how it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flying into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should you do something like that ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle East ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect .
on the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start with post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I feared for the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t m@@ ess . &quot;
I stayed in@@ doors all week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims assemble for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings watched : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged and struck .
there were really surf attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have turned the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry as well .
it is not easy to constantly asser@@ t itself .
I have nothing against any questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US &apos;s body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic champi@@ ons .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
there may be a few parking places free , but do not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as I recently told a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when it comes to the radic@@ alization process , it has been established that it starts online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or fallen away from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ fers to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised their solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que she saved from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more accepting an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if you read news reports that have been reported neg@@ atively by Muslims , they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look at the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel it first , but the toxic air of fear bath@@ es us all .
when as@@ signing collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain to themselves .
De@@ h and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was at the dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her home , as in a execution after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ h eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and there was no easy decision for us , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , put off my shoes , walked into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I broke down .
these people were there because they had with@@ drew courage and compassion from panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than yours .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with deep down , working in a clas@@ sy think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did so with the biggest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion @-@ dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones .
before sending air @-@ par@@ c@@ els into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flights , air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build up independently load@@ able structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculate calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device trying to beat two flies with one flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always one down@@ side .
a limitation of stern @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter what location the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two mo@@ ve@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one thing works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ ist , the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , the inner life happens very much , so that it can fly stable , and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flight , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when everyone is watching is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ ist is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is an exercise in abundance here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is very sym@@ metric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thus it receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive flows of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller planes .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , al@@ beit restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the most secure machine on Broadway wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , wise creations to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were orbit@@ ing each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment , they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events at first .
just 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on the earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognised them as mad geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometric gravit@@ ational @-@ shaft observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which significantly improved recognition performance .
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a last trial to clarify some minor persistent issues .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the det@@ achment of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes disappeared through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the f@@ arewell from my sick father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically these were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their signals meas@@ urable by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o for 23 years . what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a wave of gravit@@ ation is a contrac@@ tion in the structure of space and time .
when the shaft is moved forward , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers often perform a properly al@@ ber@@ y dance in courses to rel@@ ativity theory .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched out and smo@@ ked when the waves were hit . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us .
at the end of his classic text about gravit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such a metal detector are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite convenient , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
it is different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for example , the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to make the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob breaks it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we trans@@ mu@@ te wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just circular : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same cycle with an additional key change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ Yi@@ wu @-@ Yi@@ wu @-@ Yi@@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sounds &#93; No one who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- virtually or princip@@ ally -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe from them .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through since they are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the su@@ ckers for our archaeological work so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view on what is happening in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and the chir@@ p of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to everything I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of getting rid of my fear .
my fear to speak , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I make television , in a great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each con@@ sign@@ ment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV broad@@ ca@@ ster may be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode nine days by four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programmes , 70 hours of TV , three shows simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series are running succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions run into 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programs I created myself , and not just produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else does that ?
no one , so I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I am not just typing on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it is true when I say that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it &apos;s as if I set up troops , as if I painted on a canvas .
as if you carry a high tone , run a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting , intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best part is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it .
many people assume when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began to work and work and make , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive differently from size .
the feeling of not being able to do otherwise than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more the more episodes , the more things there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this sums . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sums ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single labour force .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
the engine &apos;s bu@@ zz was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a demonstration Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you are doing is suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , stupid Author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you work , you love what you do , be a teacher , be a ban@@ ker , a mother , be a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz you know when the bu@@ zz is stopped , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and I am fu@@ cking my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of money , I can &apos;t do anything except to fit .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl gets released in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the bu@@ zz but a bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the work @-@ sum , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of programmes and tel@@ ev@@ isions and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the z@@ est of life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I am a titanium ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing doesn &apos;t seem to me as much as they work .
the truth is painful ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person does he prefer to be home ?
well , yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we race around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush bubbles .
at the same time , I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always travel to my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and when my teen@@ ie daughter talks to me for 15 minutes , I &apos;m the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more it does not need .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on a piece , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes by piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready for bed .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my fe@@ el@@ essness , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I won and I &apos;ll win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes by piece , why not allow for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown tune , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part of it . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ ffed to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan that plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burns .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right h@@ um : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel the bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of being in me is broad@@ ly . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel the exact sums , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I stir you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing ability .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
they certainly have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; depth brain stimulation . &quot; thereby one im@@ planted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
you have to imagine that skull @-@ brain trauma sh@@ akes the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you need to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François managed to do this .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology training that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved otherwise .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ um cattle .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear , however -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ linguistic field and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color to be able to pursue them in the brain .
in the last step we have re @-@ imported them to the collection point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ integrate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ integrate the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re @-@ imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home .
in the second scenario we had an injury and re @-@ reim@@ plant@@ ate exactly the same cells , and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up into mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor @-@ motor area in the motor@@ ised cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand side they see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can generate about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
see now when we re @-@ imported the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that we were very exciting also for us .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal themselves .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look to the future -- You have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look in the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
you have to prove first that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable ge@@ dness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy disappears in us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs carried out in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group , succ@@ umb to a mistake , we could save us democracy , but that we need a genuine and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy , our societies will be bog@@ ged down , our future ble@@ ed and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the topic of extravag@@ ance I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that th@@ rows his long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize its twin .
a mountain of unused cash which belongs to the high net worth saving savers and corporations , but they are too anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity is desper@@ ately needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , $ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion was invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion will sound like a lot of money until you compare it to the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and hu@@ g the real estate prices .
debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally , the circumstances cause the O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my Ha@@ des with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely wa@@ sting art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial to the saving of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working arms , and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech , but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political participation with the same vote of vote in questions of state matters .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted for a long time --
like a candle that lights up very brigh@@ tly , it is burnt out quickly .
however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ able struggle between the two takes place by gradually under@@ mining policies and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing them .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power , because power is mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with Cap@@ ital@@ ism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , who so sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals of which they feed , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similar to the economy which has can@@ ni@@ ated politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations increases , political goods are being exploited , the ine@@ quality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ assemble politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; maintain control , just like in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working oppressed return only through a miracle a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin peaks become higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts lower , as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- to come in countries like China .
so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a hospital @-@ like hyp@@ er auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to &quot; Matrix &quot; or something similar to &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to indul@@ ge in the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you , in brief , some examples .
in the area of companies : please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and redemption and the concept of wage labor are completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those whom the companies belong , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not belonging to the company . no more exchange between capital and labour , no great gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising tw@@ ins .
in the area of global political economy , please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
keep in mind that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- let us call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government is paying the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technology , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the 1944 Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which it fav@@ ors privileged individuals , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all it is a world in which we can introduce a real democracy .
we will awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are we going to sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... Do we do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally confused .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t get confused you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I may say this as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the nineteenth century .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
now to blame China for doing what the West has done in the nineteenth century itself sm@@ ells great in hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is to say good@@ bye to us , and the ongoing den@@ ial that a massive fault line proc@@ eeded through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massive threats to the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continued to choose den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not able to survive by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a Minister of Finance or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the renewal of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions circul@@ ating through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the financi@@ ers , who imposed this policy on us , admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the exposed pilots will be demon@@ ically and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on the journey of a post @-@ modern in 1930 , according to which it seems to me , it will be just as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is managing director at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company at Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ horn and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where , after having watched a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , there are shows like &apos; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &apos; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price is not worried about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average be@@ aming , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s also the first time Amazon does something , so Roy Price wants nothing to risk .
he wants to create success .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch for free .
and if Amazon has released things for free , is it true ?
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you will see when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pping over or watching again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , Alpha House , but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve equals 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a little above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but it makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a contest , he and his team watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give the shows their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data se@@ greg@@ ated companies .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you have to make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
you optimize it by a very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the multi @-@ health system ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this space . come in touch with it , you are in jail .
if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether there is a dis@@ mis@@ sal or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the most promising companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that data analysis could prec@@ ede out@@ breaks of flu , the aw@@ ful species , through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great sensation sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked fine , year around year around year , until it didn &apos;t work any more ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data becomes increasingly flowing into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a branch , you put the components together again in order to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions first when they compete for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what the data says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order to avoid for@@ getting this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question , just shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will find it later with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with a lot more sophisticated like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
perhaps the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
at the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
