Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city
An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.
A chapel that is now digging for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners cultivate the erstwhile reason of farmers.
Munich's oldest official card promotes exciting stories for days.
It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone knows this, who had to get upset already, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historic maps of the Digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer by the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very insightful.
Especially when compared to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flicketing carpet, which one does not recognize as such.
In the large picture postcard, detailed maps, so-called primary position sheets, were worked into for cities and municipalities.
These were created according to the Bavarian survey management between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - naturally for military purposes.
Even if the French troops were finally departing with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.
Elector Max. Joseph further pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau," and thus the Bavarian surveying management.
The primeval sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found like all the others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling became 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser until 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
"" "where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered plots from the so-called" "" "primitive" "" "from which the basic tax was derived." ""
"" "small plots of land do not occupy any farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in the Sun" "". "" ""
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the primeval sheet, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen one reads not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the height "On the ventilation" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one used to lock people with lunatics.
"" "in 1858 / 59, the Munich-based district-asylum-asylum" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"" "" "" "he was progressive in his time and, for example, ended the betting of the so-called Irren." ""
He also prohibited the personnel to employ violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who was engaged in an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients it was initially allocated space, later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotor renaissance institute in hair 1905.
There has been the Isar Amper Hospital Munich-Ost in 2006, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.
Young people in the Munich Salesianum encounter each other on the premises of the former Auer institution.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.
West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, East residential houses from the 1980s.
"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in architectural allusion to the original building of the Irrenaissance institution, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids." ""
"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""
A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.
The Allies bombed many holes in the city center in December 1944.
A great one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-up will take place.
With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights group publishes Travel alert for Missouri
The National Federation for the Promotion of Colours has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in recent times across the state and can be noted here," stated in the opinion of the Group.
A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination suits, as well as the state prosecuting authorities, who disproportionately aim at minorities, caused the group to issue the warning, said the NAACP.
"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the trip through the state and was put into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Bureau of the General Attorney General of Missouri, where it is shown that black motorists in the state are being halted 75 percent more frequently than whites.
"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""
"" "" "" "people must be willing if they bring Caution money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""
Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting program of the FBI, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations on the 16th place of the country.
The warning is also a response to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profile.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Electric fence project is elementary
The Fishermen's Weidezvn Project is a successful project and will continue next year.
The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on site.
Representatives of the Fishermen's CDU regional association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Pivemetry Court of the Schwendemann family.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his operation, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many kittens and houses five apartments.
"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "is the alternative for him for the milk of his cows," "" "says Schwendemann." ""
On the table of the Feriengeeste, only regionals arrive.
"" "as he is also the chairman of the BLHV fisherman's bach, he called the" "" "elementary importance" "" "the" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""
"" "" "" "I can't manage to work profitably on such steep surfaces." ""
The grassland area for a lot of work, much has to be processed with the sense of brushcutter.
"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and the topography here," "" "emphasized Schwendemann." ""
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct a bio-operation.
"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad of the leaders" "" "promotion." "" "" ""
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while.
"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operations," "" "stressed the mayor." ""
Farmers are often criticised for funding
In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.
The area of preservation is 40 hectares, which cannot be forested at least 2023.
Half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.
The farmers therefore remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of soft-fence.
"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
"" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women." "" "" ""
"" "Peter Weiß asserted that" "" "the best foods are produced here." "" "" ""
The landscape care line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state support of soft fences.
The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.
The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor belt recorded by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced may not be more ppery (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fishermen's Weidezvous project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.
The area of ownership corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump is accepting the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue by himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty isitators would have liked him if he had done it.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
When Miller asked Acosta, "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is properly speaking right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporaneous response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, the miserable decay of your rich coasts."
"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable garbage" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.
This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early neoconservatives, who brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
"" "the torch will not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""
Rather unusual, Limbaugh has encountered something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch will not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black announces Scottish members of the Great Britain Team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team
"" "the power director of the UK athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""
A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
"" "black believes that" "" "in Scotland something special" "" "and the athletics of the UK must learn something from it." ""
"" "" "" "we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," "" "said Black." ""
"" "" "" "I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done." ""
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew ButRecorder - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
"" "her talk was incredible," "" "Black said." ""
"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""
"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great." "" "" ""
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete with the 400 m hurdles in her fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir leads along this path and last year has set five British and two European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that you should watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.
"" "the team captain says that they are" "" "hugely proud" "" "to the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in medals and finals." ""
"being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and elected me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.
"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.
Concerning my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are in the Olympiastadion again.
"" "I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there." "" "" ""
Block Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the burning of voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to political principles.
He slipped in the criticism, for sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogans's staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union pleaded him at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."
"" "" "" "it is only Facebook," "" "said many people." ""
But it is important.
And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval by the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.
He has shown a firm hand in directing his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to depress his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore the blocking of people coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just genuine people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not crowded, but she asked for hate crimes.
"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "I also don't appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some more than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""
"" "what the Governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in previous times, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or silence protesters.
But this is exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned voters from their Facebook page.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portable had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied in between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters came to his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters of newspapers that settled Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his position, according to historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting this.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort during the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led up to the final round in Archerfield last year, before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"" "" "" "I saw how the Renaissance club was built and we see how it reached its fame with this event," "" "said Rafferty." ""

Less lung cancer through passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer.
To this end, scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) arrive in a study.
"" "" "" "according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passive smoking per year," "" "said Heiko Becher study director." ""
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this topic since 1994.
Back then there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
"" "construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and" "" "are more or less in time" "", "said the director of the station Fred Heinze." ""
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as there is a lot of seamounts in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hampers the construction work, is a big problem for the construction company of Stumpp.
"" "" "" "the ignorance of motorists from red lights and barrier grids is already enormous," "" "says Heinze." ""
The road is locked and only the regular buses were allowed to drive through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.

"" "but luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," "" "says Marvin Kostorz." ""
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
It even rarely uses a pot.
In its wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regele in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour the charred tuber is taken with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs its daily work, e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp to wash.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it can be dangerous to work too late: most of the villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here.
"" "" "" "nobody dares to walk around in the village after 5pm," "" "she says." ""
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to be voted in front of the occupying forces.
An existing movement, which revolted for independence from Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as secluded as it is desolate. the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the rented car.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and made of corrugated iron roofs that were converted into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans learned a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"" "" "" "we were not used to wearing these clothes," "" "said Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright rock." ""
"" "" "" "in the past we only had leaves on our bodies." "" "" ""
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable goldmine in the world, Grass Hill, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a high land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport reduced its worth of $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua to ensure that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a suffocating presence.
An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units of almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in one single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970 "s have been committed to the genocide according to the Asian human rights commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"" "" "" "we Werder Everything" "" "is stated in a report by the Brisbane Archdiocese in 2016, in which reports about atrocities of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations." ""
"it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased, since Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
Population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 33% Christian, but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell roasted chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables with peanut sauce served.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"" "" "" "the migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," "" "explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai natives, who moved to work in the province capital of Jayapura." ""
"" "" "" "it has cost the native Papua - the mom mom [the women] of Papua - their market." "" "" ""
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities and violations of law in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"" "" "" "our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," "" "says You." ""
In fact, Paniai only suffered two months after Joktheis's initiation in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers offended their tone and came back with four soldiers later, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle bombs, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year old Yulianus Yulio, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and led the orphan dance - running in circles and imidating a bird song - from Papuas Mee Pago-tribe.
Some demonstrators began to hurl stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers through an internal radio: "if the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," said the official document of TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.
Nobody was listening to the mood.
"when I turned around I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says the bullet came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here.
"it was crowded, lots of shots were fired," he added.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who was witness to shooting.
"" "" "" "I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it," "" "said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only bears a name, the TIME in a dark mood." ""
"" "" "" "I saw he was dead... I knew him." "" "" ""
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"" "" "" "we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," "" "said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015." ""
"it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news about the killings occurred only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
For three weeks, Jokthei held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"" "" "" "I want this case to be solved immediately so that it won't happen again in the future," "" "he said." ""
"" "" "" "Wiranto, Minister of Defence, said in October 2016 that he should establish an out-of-court mechanism to settle historical human rights violations." ""
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"" "" "" "most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago." ""
Some were in the 90's and the beginning of the 2000-s.
"" "the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that must be traversed," "" "he said." ""
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint in Papua.
Instead, everything is regulated by law, "he said.
"" "" "" "Wiranto, which the UN has accused of" "" "crimes against humanity" "", "which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident." ""
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fidelity.
"" "" "" "I was interviewed four times over the past three years, but there was no progress," "" "says Yohanes." ""
"I'm tired."
He says he is still living in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"" "" "" "I am afraid of being arrested by the military, I am afraid to be shot." "" "" ""
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"" "" "" "after I had buried the dead bodies, the military sought me," "" "he says." ""
"" "" "" "the shootings have not stopped." ""
On Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniais neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned while fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's siting office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed one.
"we were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured people have been delivered quickly, like the TIME.
"" "" "" "I hid myself two days in my house." "" "" ""
"" "the" "" "Deiyai" "" "parliament has called to account for the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the territory." ""
Paniai was always a fraud for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal families Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by raising sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
"" "in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of" "" "securing national sovereignty" "". "" ""
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here are building everything they eat: especially nota and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
"" "" "" "over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport." ""
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua seldom have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive.
"young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission for filming was given to them.
According to Phelim Kine, the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokov's campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's unquiet eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai-shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanta Nasir, rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the human right-ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 but the Papua say they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai Committees," says Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
He wants that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, is found in poor educational and health services.
Gobai states that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he has to pay back.
"" "" "" "they don't need money, they just want justice," "" "he says." ""
Despite threats and intimidation, the victims of the Paniai-shot victims took up a last symbolic act of defiance: the dead bodies of a victim were buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes.
"" "" "" "a member of our family has been killed," "" "says Yacobus with a lowered head." ""
"what else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
A fire on Friday took place in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-meter high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that is swept through the high-rise in just two years, which is by coincidently called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"" "" "" "we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the shouting of the people." ""
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "told a resident who attacked his name as George Anab, Reuters.
Dubais's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extinguishing the fire at 4am local time (00.00 GMT) and cooling down the building.
The government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident may revive issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor environments of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from facing, exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: more Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed to attend the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup.
At the Ho Chi Minh City meeting, the proposed for this sport was a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two sets of profits, thin-thin not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
Although often very long, but also very estimated five-set classics, the traditional competition is maintained.
63.54 per cent of the member states voted for reform, the aim of the ITF president David Haggerty was therefore only scarcely missed.
"" "" "" "we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup." ""
"" "we need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," "" "said Haggerty." ""
We will continue to work to improve the application.
Not until the vote, after many contradictions, the proposal had already come to settle the final on a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right next year in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in training positions etc. are facilitated and players will have to perform less official press dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft, find out a survey
A survey among airlines carried out that more than 20 percent of the US Transportation Security Administration smuggled by deliberately prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft, while using inadvertently forbidden knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they were late to discover that they had mistakenly flown with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, carried out by a Jet Charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Among those surveyed admitted that they unknowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of the millennials were compared with less than 15 percent, the members of the generation X were.
The most common items intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted to have knowingly borne containers by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers all over the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled ware by airport security and how many things they had intentionally done.
It is no surprise that the people who wear smuggled ware - knowingly or unknowingly - wear safety, those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which liquids they may take with them or how much of it.
It is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the TSA are forbidden liquids.
For a while people thought TSA could look at books as smuggled ware.
Liquids are allowed on inland flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: order tens of thousands of Tesla customers
"" "electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to deal with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla" "" "Model 3" "". "" ""
At the same time, he has underestimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk will reveal a different, less brilliant figure for the first time on the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
During the past few months, Musk had become more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery has just begun.
Now, Musk has dreamed: of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 had already been withdrawn.
Critics repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."
At the moment 45,000 such non-binding reservations have been made, Musk cleaned up in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 cars.
By 2018, all models will be taken together - 500,000 in 2020, one million by 2020.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 bookings available per day.
Who orders a "Model 3" today may expect delivery early in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new, never-tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization in practice.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if it comes to major delays, then the liability of reservations may become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPO leader Pruitt retreats because of the withdrawal of the rules of the Obama-Era to reduce emissions
A day after he was accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline for States on October 1 to comply with the standards of Ozone in 2015.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance for one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of rigorous environmental protection regulations for a long time.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to blocking or delaying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prudential regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to co-operate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.
"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPO often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""
"" "" "" "we do not believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""
"" "we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously." "" "" ""
"" "however, the opinion of the EPO stated that Pruitt will eventually exploit his" "" "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" "" "to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information." "" "" ""
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive reversion of the ozone rules.
A draft approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.
The New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who filed the EPA this week, said the group wanted to maintain the legal pressure.
"" "" "" "the reverse of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," "" "said Schneiderman." ""
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvanien, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when contaminants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, helping thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health care and the environmentalists cheered on Prugation's surprising change of course.
"" "" "" "it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe," "" "said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity." ""
"" "" "" "we must continue fighting against the ideological Crusade of the Trump-government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests." "" "" ""
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4: 30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingens to their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."
In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Register: count Hermann von Sulz sold the hill with the parish church on Tumlingen / Germany and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the wording of the document, on the Tumour Hill, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court that belonged to the church or the patron saint, and not the other way round.
So there were also people there.
As described in the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, the "mountain" was the third, the village centre of the village, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village of Tumlingen.
Ancient maps from around the year 1600 reinforce these historical facts.
The right of patronage emerged from the early medieval self-Church right.
The owner of this church remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
Connected with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The elder of the two collapsed on Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.
The roof was leaky.
In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and the church mill and used them as firewood.
The ruins of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.
Only the bell tower was left.
In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the steeple and half fell.
In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenbach and Rolf-Dieter Wasmer maintain the Hilarius system as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.
The organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tumlingens on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery of the St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is designed by Combo des Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Hartmut Romann is talking about the closing word.
The program starts at 4.30 pm.
Admission is from 15.30.
At the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.
"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," "" "the organizers provide fantastic views." ""
The Serenade is held only in dry weather.
The organizers hope many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is important for tumors and hearing aids.
Friends and supporters of Tumlingens are particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"" "" "" "Boisheim wears" "" "does not see a legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the Council of the Council." ""
"" "the association" "" "Boisheim wears" "" "has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.
In principle, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.
"" "such zones are meant to prevent" "" "asparagus" "" "of the landscape." ""
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government in Düsseldorf had not authorized the city of Viersen because of a malfunction.
"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval certificate is still illegal and therefore also rejected," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" "" "Boisheim weaves" "". "" ""
Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a approval by the district government is still pending.
"" "Erkens:" "" "at this point, the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning." "" "" ""
The circle confirms the entrance of the request.
"" "" "" "the corresponding letters have been dealt with since last week in the circle of Viersen," "" "explained a speaker." ""
It takes them as an occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped.
"" "with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the" "" "Boisheim wears" "". "" ""
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW AG, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim niche.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area.
With the establishment of four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be covered, which corresponds to approximately one-fifth of the electricity demand of all four-channel households.
The NEW Re-intends to invest some 20 million euros.
Last summer, the City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crashing: woman dies in terrible accident
One terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o'clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was mortally injured.
Two more people were injured.
The state road was closed for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich entered the L 333 in direction of Bogel with her passenger car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53-year-old mother.
City and dealer planning "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" -weekend will make the customers aware of what offers the own city provides apart from the usual supermarket commodity.
According to the plan, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local firms should present themselves with their apprenticeship positions.
"" "in addition, the shops of the city center will invite to" "" "midnight shopping" "". "" ""
The action aims not only for residents of the city and the region.
In preparation, advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed bags, which point to the promotional week, are Christian König.
Municipal administration and commercial association co-operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
In this way, the industrial association and the city enter a further stage of the project "Attractive City."
"" "this includes new offers such as the first" "" "active day" "" "as well as selling Sunday, talks with all tradespeople and hosts to make them active participation." ""
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be reopened again or again.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city center - up to landlords, the enterprises of the whole city and clubs.
It was time for King in the spring to overcome the lethargy that took part in a network of lethargy.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will take part in the national-wide "home-shopping" day for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
"" "the day should" "" "promote the appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities" "", "says Streich." ""
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire brigade on Wednesday (local time) there was still a last in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A first missing was later also found dead.
The deaths were employees of the school.
As a cause of unhappiness, the authorities presumed working on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday there were only a few people in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump translated into leaked transcripts of telephone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump asked Enrique Pena Nieto to stop public speaking that he would not pay for a planned border wall in a telephone conversation with the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto.
"" "the US President rebelled because he publicly denounced the wall. he said to him," "" "You can't tell the press." "" "" ""
Trump started his campaign campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA, and swore to leave Mexico for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have also been published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who migrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "bad" and "dumb" and that the existence on the trade that was imparted by Obama's government would make him look like a "Depp" after having proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US.
"" "Mr. Trump ended the call after he had told Mr. Turnbull," "" "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day." "" "" ""
Moores Ford massacre: activists run racist lynching act as call for justice
A 1948-he Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and shrunk to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white rider, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles emerged to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a conifers' suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"we want this n ---- r Roger!" the man roared.
"get him out of the car!"
Screams broke the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily this terrible scene, played on July 22nd, is just a nightmare.
"" "but when a loop around the neck is thrown by" "" "Roger" "", "almost all of them crowd out very real sighs." ""
Since 2005, citizens have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one ever was accused of murder.
"" "" "" "it is really unbelievable that in all these years not one single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," "" "said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the night." ""
"it is a dirt on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life-long civil rights activist.
It serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"" "" "" "we want prosecution, we want to end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to receive justice," "" "he said." ""
"" "" "" "we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice." "" "" ""
A mediator puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynchprocess.
But nobody was ever accused.
Although the suspects remain on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch action throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer election campaign.
Approximately at the same time as the election stabbed according to the FBI of black farmers Roger Malcom a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city had been that Hester slept with Malcoms wife Dorothy and that the baby she bore didn't belong to her husband.
On July 25, 1946 Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, such as the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they removed from prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"" "" "" "as it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the killings," "" "concludes an FBI report." ""
"" "" "" "it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in murders, proofs of evidence and obscured the identity of witnesses." "" "" ""
Brooks formulates it even more concise.
"" "" "" "it was a right to vote," "" "he said." ""
"" "" "" "they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" "" "if you let yourself be registered and if you vote, this will happen to you." "" "" ""
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Their depiction is clear, poignant, and is rooted in a kind of deep racism, many of which want to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"" "" "" "we don't want to talk about the Lynching because we are confronted with the ugliness in all of us," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "but I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've done." "" "" ""
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest black - pressed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is a Greene Co-director.
He has played the role of the chief cello player for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"" "" "" "I feel dirty because I'm not like that," "" "said Marbaugh." ""
"" "" "" "but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times." "" "" ""
On the other side of the room, actors Darby Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, the Hester screams and pushes him, furiding that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"" "" "" "I said," "" "he, winch away from my property!" "" "" ""
Ancona responds to the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs at the loudest.
"" "" "" "what?!," "" "asked Rascona." ""
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"" "" "" "no," "" "said Greene, still chuckling." ""
"" "" "" "I just don't think white people back then 'n --- he' said." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "but," "" "one of the other black performers were sweating." ""
"" "" "" "you just have to hit the hard" "" "R." "". "" ""
And that is exactly where the energy shifts in space, a feeling of companionship shakes the discomfort.
Everyone is busy trying to get this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rasmussen says the N-word, he says it sharply and with imprint.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are cries, shots, and then silence.
"" "a woman, dressed with a dress dress, stands above the bodies of the actors and introduces Billie Holidays" "" "Strange Fruit" "". "" ""
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from the eyes.
The audience is divided almost equally between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down only the street.
They all experienced Georgias's oppressive moisture for almost eight hours, when Brooks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial places of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch Morde took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies.
Children sit on their heads, record the counterfeit blood and the silent body and whisper each other.
"" "" "" "they are not really dead," "" "mumbles a little boy, as if he wanted to remember." ""
After a few minutes Greene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks out with him.
"" "" "" "it's okay," "" "one of the women whispers." ""
"" "" "" "we know that it is not in your heart." ""
"" "you did that for a reason." "" "" ""
Later the audience cooperates with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a white pair of Atlanta talks about the reproduction with a black pair that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski is struggling to find words that have left the performance behind.
"" "" "" "it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like yourself and who do so because they look like you," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "what this really works with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on," "" "she added," "" "today it is called only police shooting." "" "" ""
In the same room Tyrone Brooks holds at his table, he eats and recalls the civil rights.
He said he started planning the performance next year.
"" "" "" "the delivery is inspiring in a way as it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," "" "he said." ""
"" "" "" "it's like we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again." ""
"" "whoever does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat them." "" "" ""
Götterdämmerung "reconciled the Wagnerian in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf uses a colorful-frivole staging in front of a gigantic six-story setting.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar DENIC) shows either a screaming street corner including the Berlin Wall and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plastic and Elaste" logo from East Germany or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes classic car park, in which the Rhine killers pose as rock energies, or alternatively an isetta.
Stacked oil drums remind of Castor's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that moves through his "ring" staging.
"" "the three Rhine killers - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the" "" "Rheingold" "". "" ""
Kess Siegfried (Stefan Vinke) deceive Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), pull a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood-style and give the Krapino-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxers.
Brutally the scene when he smiles Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oak) still has to believe in it.
The audience thanked the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are stormy, who humble himself and forcefully bows his hands to the Chancellor.
There is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat in casual leisure clothes.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team was eagerly awaited.
In 2013, he had still had to leave behind a gellas pipe concert, there were five years later a great jubilation in which the scattered "Buh" calls went underground.
Festspielchefin Katharina Wagner is pleased to have enjoyed this.
"it is noticeable that the audience has grown together with the" ring "in a certain way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience did not only make a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of its view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max crowd works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: normally in Steinfurt in the Furniture Fair, once a week I will help in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at school in the open whole day.
What are your experiences with that?
Crowd: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-time volunteer.
How does that come about?
Crowd: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering study, we say, successfully broken off.
For me, I realized that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what are you doing.
Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on the spot, at the focal point.
And was it so?
Crowd: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably doing a social worker training at the Jugendamt Herne and studying at Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not something unusual to have several different locations during the Volunteer Service?
Quantity: yes, it is very variable.
It always depends where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really runs out.
What's different from a civil engineering course?
Crowd: sure, here it's not about calculating statics.
One always has other people head, each having a completely different story behind him.
Whether a refugee or a teenager has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no reservations?
Crowd: I'm not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday, it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will start to overcome the pressure that the company faces.
The job shedding that General Director John Fallon announced largely for the end of 2018 and early 2019 is in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in a third cost reduction program to revive a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning.
The company, which had sold its shareholding in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed at suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, the Afghan capital, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, said officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, declared an explanation by NATO.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO statement, it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "man carried improvised explosive" sentence. "
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian fatalities in Afghanistan in the first six months of 2017, of which some 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had conducted this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombings in the city center killed more than 150 people with the most lethal militant attack in the country since the US-led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, their policies and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA Returns Decision to Delay the smog rule according to complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government, according to which states are obliged to curb the smog-causing emissions. this occurred a day after 15 states accused the Agency for the step.
"" "the EPA announced late on Wednesday to push ahead with the so-called" "" "Ozone Provisions 2015" "", "and said they show the agency's commitment to work with States." ""
"" "" "" "we believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," "" "said EPA boss Scott Pruitt in an explanation." ""
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to determine the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where incisions must be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Trump.
However, efforts have sparked the setbacks of the Democrats and nature protection groups, who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
"" "the website of the EPO says that inhaling air containing ozone" "" "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" "" "such as asthma." ""
Community wants common room
At the end, the decision was clear: in the case of two counterparts, the community council of Fluorn-Winner decided to set up a community space in the future retirement home.
Prior to the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Admittedly, it will take a long time until the area belongs to the community, but there is no plans for planning a project that would be planned by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a community space.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space of some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are floating in such a common space not as a meeting place just for the inhabitants of the seniorial living, but openly entering into the church.
"" "as an example, the word" "" "knitting café" "" "made the turn." ""
"" "" "" "sweetening is the decision which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn by means of funding." ""
Construction is in the refurbishment area.
The installation of a community room would be, according to Tjaden, capable of supporting 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposed decision to signalize the investor is that in this respect no billets will be thrown between the legs, the finding that both semitrailers - what is leaning against the surrounding building - as well as pitch roof - which reduces the height of the trunks and makes the construction more economical - could be possible.
Unnecessary, so does not only mean Wilfried sole, be this addition.
When it helps: it happens unanimously to the body.
It's not that easy with the common room.
"" "Daniela's call refers to the many own buildings with which one does not come so well, but now they lean at the common room out of the window, she says:" "" "I am very busy with it." "" "" ""
Yvonne Staiger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden payout to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsidy, but a real, in doubt marketable counter-value, is the counter-speech.
Three proponents will find the request to apply the resolution accordingly.
"" "it remains the same with two counterparts in the original programme that Stefan Haller summarises:" "" "if we grasp the decision, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure." "" "" ""
Collision with car: cyclist is thrown on the street
When crossing the road a 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath and severely injured.
As the police informed, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the bike path of Schwarzer Weg from the direction of Hilden on the bike path of the Schwarzer road.
The Senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger car driver who was driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder was driving on the road, he obviously did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He met with a car, which controlled a 66-year-old Hildeness.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a return carriage.
FC Bayern Munich has to renounce the Supercup on Borussia Dortmund on David Alaba and Thiago
The Supercup is taking place without him: David Alaba must suck the game against Dortmund.
With personnel worries, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
Human resources at the German Football Record Champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger and bigger at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund in front of the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 / ZDF and Eurosport).
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to do without a duel with the BVB on David Alaba.
The Italian confirmed on Friday.
In addition, Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six years, Ancelotti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"" "" "" "we know that we are not in the best physical condition," "" "said Ancelotti and added:" "" "the most important point is the balance in the team." ""
"" "last but not least, that was not good." "" "" ""
But the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory match of the season.
Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
"" "we want to play intelligently," "" "said Ancelotti, who expects a difficult, intense game." ""
The duel of the two German soccer heavyweights attracts the fans.
The game is sold out with 81.360 viewers, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking in the Harz Mountains to Star
"" "in the resin, the nation-wide first" "" "star path" "" "is to emerge." ""
This is the plan of the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg (Sankt Andreasberg).
There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003.
"" "a" "" "star path" "" "is contrary to the information needs of many visitors of the harzers." ""
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
"" "in a first phase until 2018, the association is planning" "" "well accessible installations in five to six locations" "" "in Oberharz." ""
Ask St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels should be added via the internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting a location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the Starpath Ticket will be extended by train.
"" "" "" "on the star path, the viewer experience a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," "" "the association explained." ""
They also learned why stars had different colors or why a star is more luminous than another, although it was far from distant.
It also conveys in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see.
The association already operates in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014, the highest observatory in Northern Germany.
According to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation, the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with a naked eye can be seen clearly.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Starlight - the Planetary Trail in the university city since 2003.
Starting from Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee that forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetary Trail leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extra-terrestrial" site in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stele with the individual planets - including the degraded Pluto at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun standing exactly 75 meters measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planet is about four kilometres.
While the light from sun up to the Pluto requires about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next star-star, however, would last half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomarenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomarenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko to the World Boxing organization Super feather weight champion.
After Garcias's victory through unanimous decision on the former four-year-world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime both Fighters are members of the top-five Pound-for Pound list.
"" "Garcia stretched out his right hand and said," "" "How are you, champion?" ""
I wish you good luck. "
Lomarenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomarenko-Manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"" "" "" "I am a former feather weight," "" "Garcia reminded." ""
"" "" "" "I grew up for bronze [to 140 lbs], but I'm not that big." ""
I am small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move to light weights [135 Pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let us give them this. "
Lomarenko agreed.
"boxing needs this fight."
Climate asked if it should be pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomarenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to schedule a date in the next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell, after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"" "" "" "this fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it," "" "Garcia said, and later insisted on fighting on the network that offers the best financial package." ""
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he loved Lomarenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may possibly participate in his Saturday combat.
But Lomarenko was grateful to Garcia with his generous praise and said that he thinks the three-battle champion from Riverside looks very slowly, sorry Mikey... you wanted the Ko-off. "
Garcia said the focus was to show drummer, then boxing.
They both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle.
"" "" "" "this is the battle that must be done." ""
No other struggle achieves so much attention and enthusiasm.
"" "I'm more than happy to work on it," "" "Garcia said." ""

Four injuries to ire platter
During an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point at 4.30 a.m. shortly before the connection point.
The car shifted to the right into the embankment, where he overturned and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident.
During the initial supply of the injured through the rescue service, the A7 was closed in the direction of the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be diverted to the accident scene.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "the supply chain works better"
After 2: 2 andre Hoffmann is hoping for the season opener of Braunschweig to point out the optimisation of the defense formation in Aue points.
With the first round of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result, too, were not the two opponents at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"" "" "" "this was too much for two opponents, and we have to pay better attention in Aue," "" "said Fortuna Duesseldorf defendant." ""
In the Ore Mountains, the three-chain should also be further optimized.
And a gate after a kick-off, the Fortunas don't want to catch up anymore.
"" "" "" "for the future, there will be no more than Michael (Rensing) on the line." "" "" ""
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation with the supply chain, his team is better able to cope better than with the supply chain.
"I don't yet know how we will act in Aue," said his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is confident of his cause, "because we are in the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Foelmann, who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"" "" "" "the prerequisite is, however, that we are working even better and we do not make so many flaws in the building." "" "" ""
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"" "" "" "but if you can talk about a failure from a failed start, you don't know." ""
"" "the performance could be okay," "" "said Hoffmann." ""
"" "" "" "but if we can get four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season opener." "" "" ""
His trainer didn't want to know about it.
"I only rated the start in the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to a storm.
"" "" "" "now they can start the season with a home game," "" "said Funkel and Hoffmann that the players from Aue might even be somewhat fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favor in the bones." ""
"" "" "" "but they don't know exactly where they are at the moment," "" "says the inner defender of Fortuna." ""
The guests from the Rhineland place as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"" "" "" "that we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupid," "" "says Funkel, whose balance is positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games." ""
"there is no team in the second Bundesliga which you have to hit from the start," explains Fortunas's chief coach.
"meeting such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so, Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Application Test published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (Rättskyinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Committee (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 tests to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
"" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "may be under 18 years of age." "" "" ""
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"" "" "" "we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are fairly constant," "" "he said of The Local." ""
The high percentage of cases where the person exceeds 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that asylum seeker has lied about his age.
"" "in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases that suggest" "" "suggesting that the person under investigation is 18 years or older." "" "" ""
When the paper Svenska Dagbladet evaluated the 581 published results, she discovered that in 243 of these cases the person frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, x-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological age of humans to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later.
"" "" "" "I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." ""
Judging the biological age in this way is very insecure.
"" "if we cannot say safely, we shouldn't do as if we could," "" "he said to the newspaper Metro." ""
Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is minimal.
"" "the biggest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent." "" "" ""
Fully in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete slab on the bridge was installed at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's great," "" "said Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Traffic at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""
In April, the works began at the same time on all three renovation needing bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is scheduled for October and it is sure that the schedule will be complied with.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.
It is a arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red Buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach reached a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge on Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is a border fastener, which is also used as an operating way.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge crane is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path is to run.
The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridges.
A special feeling of intuition has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handsets about the project.

AfD in Gerolstein: bunder protest in German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the District Day Volcaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance, which shows a peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD in Gerolsteiner Stadthalle invites Rondell to the "Great Electoral Campaign."
And familiar names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the deputy chair Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-athletes but to demonstrate.
"" "the motto" "" "The Eifel remains colorful." "" "" ""
Originally the city picnic under the motto "All at a table" was planned at the fountain square, but is now taking place in the parking lot below the Rondelles - and thus right in front of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colourful picture that is offered.
"" "and what Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organisers, is really happy:" "" "great how many people have come together here." "" "" ""
There is music and a lot of food, including a "ancient potato salad, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him along.
The police have ordered many civil servants to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Volcanic Eifel reports that he tried to make such an event and received the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf initially questioned in Daun, but there was a cancellation, because there were not enough parking spaces available due to the already built Laurentius church.
"" "so now the Rondelle, Hompes is happy that" "" "we can have such a beautiful event here." "" "" ""
"" "with a view of the event on the" "" "Rondellvorplatz" "", "he says:" "" "that's the good right of people, main thing, it remains peaceful." "" "" ""
This also does: at 8 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band for entertainment, in the Stadthalle various speakers, among them the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the auditorium, who wait for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Stork.
The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there it is announced shortly after 9pm.
The police can move on - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
A reunion with the trombone trombone Frederic Belli will be present in the series of Haslacher Klostermarierte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8pm in the monastery church.
Together with Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held soloppositions in European top orchestras.
Thus Petkov solo trumpet player at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo soprano of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both united the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sings in a new garb, Daniel Schnyders "world music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the jazz catcher Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play merge into a fascinating total artwork.
This core piece of the program was premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it for the two musicians and still more: the Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.

West Virginia Governor announces that he changes the Party
The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
"" "whether you like it or not, the democrats have removed from me," "" "Governor Justice said." ""

CoE praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
The global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again.
Russian athletics boss Dmitry Shylachtin told during the IAAF congress on the eve of the Athletics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the doping.
"" "he said," "" "I'm sorry for" "" "all athletes, who have been meddled with gold and silver medals in competitions." "" "" ""
Despite his comments, the IAAF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"" "" "" "I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," "" "said IAAF President Coe to the reporters." ""
"" "" "" "the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is redesigned." "" "" ""
"" "CoE said he was also" "" "delighted" "" "that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-establishment." ""
"" "" "" "I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to reuse Russia," "" "Coe said." ""
"" "" "" "we have to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation." ""
"" "the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the depraved system," "" "he added." ""
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete in athletics world championships, starting on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral actors.
The leader of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, announced on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a reunification.
"" "" "" "drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited coaches are still free," "" "he said reporters in London after a lecture at IAAF Council." ""
A tragedy for soldiers who had died in Mali
During a funeral service in Fritzlar, North Hessische Fritzlar, around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures.
As Minister of Defence, Ursula von der Leyen (CDU), Minister of Defence, Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
"" "she described the two opposite drivers but as" "" "experts of their trade." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "we bow down to this highest sacrifice made by them in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," "" "she explained." ""
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Stabsauptmann from Nordhessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzexpose Cathedral of St. Peter on Thursday.
At noon, only the relatives in the church took leave.
After that, the funeral service began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the German army and politics.
Among them Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the German Armed Forces Volker Wieker.
Roses laid down, the relatives were arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzexpose and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a screen.
"" "Secretary of Defense of the Leyen called the infiltrated soldiers" "" "highly decorated" "" "and cramped." ""
The Stabshauptmann used the flight operation of the combat helicopter tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six educated Tiger pilots of his regiment.
"" "Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to whom the soldiers belong, declared:" "" "if the crew could not turn away the crash, nobody would have liked it." "" "" ""
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali, Minister of the Leyen did not show that the deployment is dangerous.
"" "but it is also of great importance" "" "for a country of which we are separated only by two states," "" "she said." ""
After the funeral service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik wants no grave beside his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was shared by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, and she continued to speak.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik never had a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's accession to the throne in 1972 he would have liked to become king.
"" "in 2016 he retired and also took the title" "" "princely supper" "". "" ""
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby declared, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be, be still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
Born in 1965 in London, Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, met Margrethe in London.
He worked on the Thames in the French embassy.
During his later wife's sympathy for the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
"" "in an autobiography, Henrik commented on the first years in Denmark:" "" "a few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized." ""
My Danish was wavering, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gaulises, which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of Society critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed.

Prime Minister Weil wants to re-election quickly
CDU and FDP in front of a potential majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD), after the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the Landtag, does not want to resign.
"" "" "" "because of the parliament's resolution on Friday." ""
Prior to that, the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from its parliament in Lower Saxony had overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Parliament election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its close one-vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition of CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Party member Elke Twesten combined her step with non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"" "" "" "I see my political future in the CDU," "" "she explained on Friday in Hanover." ""
CDU leader, Björn Thümler, wants to recommend his group to record them.
Thus, CDU and FDP had 69 seats in the Lower-Saxon Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
Up to now the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected as scheduled on January 14 next year.
Thumler said the red-green state government must now decide if it could continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the country's day as quickly as possible decides its self-dissolution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also foresees the possibility that the parliament's parliament draws the trust and chooses a successor.
"" "" "" "our Constitution provides several options." ""
"" "these possibilities must be checked legally," "" "said Thumler." ""
"" "" "" "one will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally binding." "" "" ""
Thümler called Twestens "step" but something weird. "
"" "the politician himself stressed:" "" "I am not a traitor." ""
"" "I feel very good." "" "" ""
She described herself as a bearer of black-green.
The Greens called on the apostate parliamentarians to return their country mandate.
"" "" "" "we, of course, assume that she returns her country mandate from the green national list, with immediate effect," "" "said the chairman Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner." ""
"" "said S & D Group president, Anja Piel," "" "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten exceedingly." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "she consciously decided not to lead any pronunciation in the group." ""
"" "" "" "even against the background that there were no differences in content, we can't understand this step." "" "" ""
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxony's Green-Democrat MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"" "" "" "the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treason to voters but also treason to red-green," "" "said the Bundesrat of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook." ""
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly elect the parliament.
The exit Twestens costs the majority of Red-Green in Lower Saxony.
"" "the politician is" "" "in her last vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the good of the country," "" "criticised the Secretary-General Hubertus Heil." ""
"" "" "" "it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intrigue and attempts to make political capital." "" "" ""
Lower Saxony's CDU leader, Björn Thümler, wants to recommend his MEPs to take Elke Twesten into the CDU.
The group leader of the SPD in the German Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Trash of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career gifts.
The CDU at that time before the SPD was strongest power, SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament day.
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gypsies, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany discusses infested eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) speaks and answers.
Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
"" "" "" "I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure." ""
On the consumer protection portal www.grocery-warnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to all that we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clarifier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economy?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately turned up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since we became acquainted with Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available for consumers.
Retailers are concerned just as manufacturers have to ensure that the sold products are transportable and health safe.
If the residual value of 0,005mg / kg is exceeded, these are not transferable.
Unloaded eggs can however be sold and consumed.
This time, not the factories are to blame.
Do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production plants are not directly responsible.
On the contrary, they must reckon with economic damage on the basis of alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too little controllers in the case of serious seriousness.
Is there only a lack of personnel or a conclusive competence?
It was just the official controls that have revealed the process.
Truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
Precisely for this reason, a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutors in the cases where crimes can be available are of decisive significance.
I have already made clear several times that I am awaiting a complete enlightenment by the responsible authorities.
Is regular erasm really necessary for food scandals?
"" "" "" "consumers have the right to get only safe and marketable food." ""
"" "" "" "when a non-approved insecticide is used in food industry, consumers are rightly outraged." ""
By means of the panelled funds, manufacturers, retailers and consumers are confronted with a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food-safe animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This has to be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels.
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be informed promptly and without gaps.
How the Financial Regulations of Football on Neymars Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues from European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG must eventually prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.
PSG can certainly make money in order for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the host family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to use legitimate sources of income that allow them to break the break even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to club debts to monitor their losses.
The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a tougher matter.
During the current three years FFP default period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini has fallen in favor of the presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare away from excessive expenditures.
"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely increase the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue for the next five years will be in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.
The first wave of EU penalties in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catarist company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship's value was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that a part of PSG payments to Neymar could be due to payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar World Cup ambassadors are going to become such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more aware of every attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke under the conditions of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.
Accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose society is owned by an American sport-tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga Against a State that finances an association.
"" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years," "" "said Wenger on Thursday." ""
"" "" "" "once a country has an association, everything is possible." ""
"" "it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country." "" "" ""
Swiss is looking for a new supplier
In recent years Chocolat Frey board chocolate has produced board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is at the end of a possible end: the airline writes the order again.
"" "Swiss-speaking speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper" "" "Nordwestschweiz" "" "from Friday." ""
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"" "" "" "we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," "" "said the speaker." ""
Some 17 million small-and-white, red-and-white plastic sheets spread over 14 grams a year before landing on the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
"" "industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to" "" "Northwestern Switzerland" "" "to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs." ""
But the advertising effect is more important: for a scoop manufacturer, it is a prestigious job.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender.
But only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate boards have been distributing Swiss flights since 2006 on board their flights.
Before Swiss made a contract with the daughter Migros, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss made the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long haul flights, the first class customers will be indulged with treats from the confectionery Sprüngli, in Business Class bags passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
On the short stretch, Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey distributes both business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus-Olympic Champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time World Champion fights a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national championship race and could only look at the discus competition from the tribune.

Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year Grunge era (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.
"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humors (it contained an original story for a duly jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By bracing at the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play cool kids who grow up - still managed to win back the last part of the weather.
"ten Years Later," with his adults who are now adults, is less emotional rooted and his parody goes more after the casting principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90 "s such as" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "(" The hand that crackles the cradle ").
"" "at one point, one character sticks through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" "" "a number of other things from 1991." "" "" ""
Many of the central stories are the same.
The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, still has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.
And there is another mad-evil plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good visual impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, exams are the best part of franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's underlip of "Singles" whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of accidental madness that could fuel this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"" "" "" "Comrade Detective" "" "on Amazon is reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by" "" "The Americans" "", "the film" "" "Atomic Blonde" "" "and even" "" "GLOW" "" "with its East-against-West wrestling iconography." ""
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic iosef - are being played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues will be dubbed by Channing Gestum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching TV watching how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
With six long episodes, it runs away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," who was edited on a lower length, could better supply his agitprop satire since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a forage for a money.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and theirs.
Strike against Drugs-Mafia in the Land
The police managed to blow up the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor told Konstanz on Friday.
At the same time, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued warrants of arrest.
In addition, the officials treated larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.
With the same raids in Italy, two persons were arrested.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore probably shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigations were involved in the action.
A total of more than 300 policemen were in action.
The Mafia members are accused of organised crime, heavy violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.
The public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany since summer 2016.
Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investigators of the Cripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large-scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigation focused mainly on Italian nationals with a close relationship with the Italian mafia.
Also a incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a pub early in the morning, should go to the bank's account.
"" "" "" "way complains big gaps in the foreigner register" ""
"" "" "" "data from citizens who should not appear" "" ": according to a report, the foreigner register in Germany shows substantial shortcomings." ""
This leads to some serious misjudgement in case of asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Commissioner for Refugee Management of the German Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to a large gaps in the country register.
"" "deficiencies in the data recorded there may lead to" "" "serious misdecisions" "" "in cases of asylum procedures and deportations, warned the way in an analysis of the" Süddeutsche Zeitung "" "." "" "
According to the data, ten million people with foreign nationalities were recorded in the register, among them 5,7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been properly maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
"" "in individual cases, data from 1921 were found," "" "by people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "faulty data entries can considerably slow return processes," "" "says the report." ""
"" "" "" "in statistics on sufficient people, EU citizens are also grasped, who wouldn't have to travel." ""
"" "these false assignments, however, led" "" "to a distorted debate on how to deal with excreators" "", "i.e., in analysis." ""
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy under 16-year-old children if they have come from there.
The "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" reports from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF).
"" "the paper therefore states that" "" "BAMF takes such procedures" "" "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017." "" "" ""
Since the end of 2014, it was practically no longer possible, as the paper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
"" "" "" "according to the Dublin Agreement, the EU state is responsible for refugees at first." ""
When a migrant travels to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of immigration.
"" "the office now writes:" "" "meanwhile the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased." "" "" ""
Italy made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficiently.
"" "" "" "other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement." ""
The internal political spokeswoman of the Left faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "families with children threaten unlawful admission conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreifenbach were already available to the blood donor service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all Jürgen Greule, who now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the congregation acknowledges multiple readiness to donate blood in the council's meeting.
"" "" "" "it is ingenious how our bodies are created for it, and we are respectful of the donors of respect that their blood is available for strangers," "" "stressed mayor Karlheinz Kistner." ""
"" "" "" "a single blood donation helps several people," "" "explained the roundabout leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned are decomposed into their constituents." ""
Three people could already benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time Maisenbacher reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Oberreichenbach.
"" "" "" "this year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," "" "said the DRK roundabout manager." ""
Obviously, the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants only a few years ago.
Previously, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umberry were counted among multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations.
Half as many reserve Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times each 500 millilitres of their life juice.
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of a strengthening pressure.
The political decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members pursuing a rise this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on domestic revenues would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that in the next few years rate increases would be needed to curb the inflation of the Brexit and she said that the costs of credit might have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets.
The members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut business stimulus package issued one year after the Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that now it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - with £115 billion.
After deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said: "in the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."
"" "at the interest rates, it reiterated that" "" "a certain tightening of monetary policy" "" "would be necessary for cooling inflation and a" "" "greater" "" "scale than the markets expect." ""
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
"" "however, the Bank stressed that increases were" "" "gradual" "" "and" "" "limited" "". "" ""
The forecasted growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations for interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is likely to recover slightly after the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor increases in wages, as the tightening is getting worse before it gets better.
"" "she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot" "" "prevent the incomes" "", "but she added that wages are going to recover" "" "significantly" "" "towards the end of its three-year forecasts." ""
The economy is also boosted by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak Pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers in July demanding an increase to 0.5%.
Inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected to attract it over the coming months.
"" "the Bank said that the excess in proportion to their target of 2% was" "" "entirely" "" "to the weak Pound." ""
"" "Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "" "given the recent withdrawal of Swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are looking for businesses looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way." ""
"" "the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mortgages complete, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular." "" "" ""
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in the NHS after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-sexual preventive prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling stating that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the assertion that local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to enable the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 in all of England.
Preposition prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV agents taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission at risk of infection.
Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In hospitals, suitable candidates are identified which agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program is signed £10 million and NHS UK signed a contract for delivery of medications this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence of how it is used and implemented on a large scale.
"" "Stevens said:" "" "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." ""
"" "it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in coping with one of mankind's greatest health challenges." "" "" ""
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
"" "we warmly welcome this announcement." "" "" ""
"" "Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "" "the priority now is to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind." ""
"" "now that prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people." "" "" ""
"" "said Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Shadows, said:" "" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government." ""
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.
"" "" "" "now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that they will contribute to bringing a step closer to the dissemination of HIV in society." "" "" ""
Living the Big Life: mezzanine and clever designer-tricks have turned this Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former owner of real estate, shrunk from a big Knightsbridge house to Earls Court Apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold her.
"before, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet have been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous slab height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed von Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.
"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""
"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""
"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF panel." ""
"" "" "" "it is important that when you push the door, it is very easy to glide." "" "" ""
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"in a vestigial form, a real estate agent will enter and execute a calculation based on the ground size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""
"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square metervalue of some standard in something completely amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a USD 500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in an argument because of one of Victorias's largest real estate empire worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business capacity should be divided.
Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
The West co-jeans family grew up there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her late father Colin - by Paul as the "master operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A legal file says that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash has been a problem for Paul.
"" "" "" "the units proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affirmdavit in 2015." ""
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed negotiations.
The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul says, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early Affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"" "" "" "my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""
The costs increase with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeans-load of the family.
Colin says he started with Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their sons.
"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to trial," "" "she wrote." ""
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, whereby Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.
"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul says" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""
Colin was very shy, although he was a former AFL member of the AFL and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case was before the courts." ""
"" "" "" "it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to dress our surname through the courts" "", "he wrote." ""
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.
"" "" "" "our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute," "" "he said, adding that he is still hoping for a solution." "" "" ""
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"" "" "" "our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future," "" "Colin wrote." ""
Trumps is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really can do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.
Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"when John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior employees on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House that he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president.
"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information." "" "" ""
Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trumps relationship with television ranges back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were convincing," "" "said former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February over Politico." ""
"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habitual under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""
Okay. okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials don't know what we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more ignition without their interventions.
We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump hasn't sent.
If his co-workers manage to keep annoyance from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented any contentious controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
"" "" "" "Politico - dealing with this story - reported in May about the advisers" "" "preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons." ""
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that drunkers like a volcano can react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he is eager to find out where these come from." ""
This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet vocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for chicane, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoiced it.
Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "attempted to implement a system for managing and documenting the trump."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.
These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be requested and hoped.
The police all over Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer (virtual) postcards.
As the addresses of the searched heavy criminals are not known naturally, references from the population will be hoped and asked.
"" "Europol reported on Friday of the action that follows the" "" "EU Most Wanted" "" "Advent Calendar of the Winter." ""

Travelers negotiate about a ditch and return to the 'millionaire series'
Some of the wealthiest landlords in the West of Midlands are standing again with some resolute travellers on the base of war, who have traded a trench drawn from the church to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
"" "the passengers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, which is called the" "" "millionaire series" "". "" ""
They carried horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were released in May without being deterred by a ditch dug by the Council to prevent their accidents.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
"" "angry residents have urged the Council of Solihull who said it" "" "be useless to deal with the problem." "" "" ""
"" "an anonymous inhabitant said:" "" "they moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded to Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by." ""
The Council must be forced by shame to implement it, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.

"" "she added," "" "The Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long instructions to protect its parks." ""

From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then ambience operating company ltd. until 13 April 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax.
In the fall of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the county.
The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.
But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers at the house.
He was to be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again into a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt-object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are welcome Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, building shuttles have been in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is carried out.
The floors have been torn out, ceilings are broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is still much to do until March.
"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows will be installed.
"" "everything was to become" "" "pretty bourgeois" "" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself." ""
"we want to make a piece of jewellery."
The swimming pool, the wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.
One does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already at a higher centre level, shaver emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, is to be set up wide, shearches further.
Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel.
He had talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, Scherer says.
The city's performances are identical to those of the hotel group.
"we are on the same line."
According to the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself precisely.
Almost under a million euros, he reckons.
The exterior installations are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: us special negotiator sets Grand Jury
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Ambassador Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
"" "in recent weeks, the committee has begun work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "referring to the cause of familiar persons." ""
The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigations.
The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already initial invitations by the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have been purposefully interfered with in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation focuses on several men who acted in the election campaign as consultants of the Republican.
According to reports Mueller took a close look at more and more drumps in private and business environments.
"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special issuer Trump came to the centre personally and examined the accusation that the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""
The main task of Grand Lawys is to check the evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether it should be charged.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called anchor pegs.
They are mostly switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.
The process always takes place behind closed doors.
The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons under oath.
According to CNN, invitations were issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were summoned to a statement, called it in the report.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr. were also Trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former election chief Paul Manafort during the conversation.
On Thursday evening, legal experts said on US television that the objection would show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the charging of an indictment.
"" "" "" "nevertheless, the setting up of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Trump is to be set up." ""
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.
"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""
"" "the issue give the democrats a way to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.
But they usually work in secret, he emphasised.
"" "the White House respects all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""
"" "" "" "the former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not against the president." ""
I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.
"" "" "" "because of this rooting accusations, accusations against drunkards have become loud, they have obstructed the judiciary." ""
Comey said in June of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure for the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special issuer and his staff.
This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller would be released.
Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented Bill of Law on Thursday, after which the special issuer could not be dismissed as easily as possible.
Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the western Antarctic a gigantic iceberg has become detached from the ice shelf just seven times the size of Berlin.
This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The Koloss, which weighs heavily over a trillion ton and 5800 square-kilometre, now drives to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
There is no danger for human beings.
According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.
There have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now aborted colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.
Ice cream floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen-C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed several years ago.
A complete cowardice is torn down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say about the fact that the Larsen-C ice shelf is in danger, as the front edge never pulled back as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can break down if a piece breakage at one key.
The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glacier flows directly into the sea and can flow faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to monitor Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean some 200 meters.
There it breaks regularly.
"although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.
"" "" "" "this is the widest retreat since the record began," "" "he confirmed." ""
Scientists have disputed whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly gather together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not trace the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-chicks of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.
This long skirt of the Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic ice surface has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The decrease in temperature has contributed to the decrease in temperature.
The Antarctic Peninsula has been heated by around three degrees in the last 50 years and so it counts to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants house tariff at the personnel
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls for the employer's association to step out to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the circle-day has set 41 new places in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have finished their first working day.
The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously much sought after.
Around 620 applications were reported for the places that were to be procured this year.
Nevertheless, the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 unoccupied places in the circle of Mettmann.
Among other things, the search for doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""
The aim is to meet not only short-term needs for skilled workers but to counteract forward-looking applications.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwardly, show concrete measures for newcomers and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
"" "the speech is from a" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""
This is accompanied by a high number of employees who terminate the service illness or age-related reasons.
"" "" "" "high time for action so that there are no more places left unoccupied." ""
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the common application with his party.
He recently caused a laze-thick surprise in the circle of circles when he questioned the staffing of personnel and stunned the remaining parties.
People want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a discharge from the municipal employers' association.
"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county council with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a house tariff," "" "said people." ""
The CDU is thus trying to pay better to employees and officials when it comes to the public service tariff.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards working years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Reservation Act.
Last but not least, the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy accentuates the tone on NGO migrants' rescue boats
Italy has warned that NGOs operating lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not be allowed to continue doing so if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work," "" "said Minister of Minister Marco Minni in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Retained' because their team worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself on detailed allegations of Ambrogio Cartosio, an Italian prosecutor.
"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in an opinion on social media." ""
"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat from 'Youth Retained', the Iuventa, since October.
It is thought that his crew takes ship dinghy migrants, who are delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa, above all, must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "to their rescue operations." ""
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize laureate organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
"" "" "" "meanwhile, Minni said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the bailout measures had fallen dramatically in recent weeks, which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""
"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.
Suits and Trials
Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for touring.
The Burgundy and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
Viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels.
In between there were always long climbs, for the long trims rewarded.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival sausage market.
"" "again, there was a lookout point at the lookout, connected by" "" "flying" "" "trims and moderate ascents." ""
During the last two days a lot of altitude metres have been announced.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled healing Sole in the open air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and culturally -.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport
Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of venturing through the stadium in wind and weather?
Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels inclusive.
These have also recognised the first Federal ligades who are increasingly involved in this area.
The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the game FIFA 17.
"" "" "" "we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," "" "says CEO Jochen Röttgermann." ""
"" "he is certain that many clubs rise up this train." "" "" ""
Next weekend, the FIFA World Association organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where gamers compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt's potential in E-Sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"real football must deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.
With prominent e-athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than only once a year send the federal government to Asia.
What is it all about?
In E-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the soccer-simulation FIFA are fought on a level of competition.
As in normal sports, leagues have long since become established in which the pros compete against each other.
And for the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme.
But is it really a sport?
For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.
Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which are also found in the classic sport - for example increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition.
"the fender player is a good player."
"" "but Frobing also sees problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" ""
Controls are difficult to carry through online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.
The scientists highlight the high integrative impact of e-sport.
The players are on the road all over the world, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-sport.
As a result, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany in 2016, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.
"" "however," "" "e-sport" "" "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," "" "writes the Deloitte advisors." ""
Many countries are already on the move.
Big markets are Asia and the USA where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot to do in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobbing.
In the Netherlands and France, the football league football clubs according to Dutt have in the meantime been obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"Germany is lagging behind in the European comparison," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Only in nostalgia to decay and to extinguish the old times is not enough today.
It is about keeping the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
"we live in a digitalised world," says Dutt.
"" "" "" "we cannot hold on to the fact that everything remains as it always was with football." "" "" ""
Venom Eggs - egg alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and put all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
In the shelves only eggs are to be taken, which do not contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics Conrad Roy
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years of imprisonment.
Carter was convicted in June of Conrad Roy's negligent murder, taking life on 13 July 2014.
"" "the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday:" "" "my family is inconsolable." ""
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.
She was faced with a 20-year sentence, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downwards looking eyes when she was convicted.
"" "" "" "her actions have killed Conrad Roy," "" "said the prosecutor to the court." ""
"" "" "" "she finished his life to make her own better." ""
"" "she has no responsibility," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "she has not shown remorse." "" "" ""
"" "but Carter's lawyer stated that it was a" "" "terrible circumstance" "". "" ""
"" "judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that their" "" "age or maturity" "" "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions." "" "" ""
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that "there is no day when I do not regret the loss of my beloved son.
"" "I want him to be proud of me and how I am going with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain, which we will bear for eternity." "" "" ""
"" "Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was" "" "persecuted" "" "by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or would be an aunt for his children." ""
"" "" "" "no longer the only person I've been with since my birth each day is a pain that I will always remember for the rest of my life" "", "she said." ""
The case seems to be a legal precedent since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life.
"hang on, jump from a building, get yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news, which she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you need to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the case by any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter belonged Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
"" "Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" "" "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison." "" "" ""
Joshua Kimi: learning from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimi was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern will win a big season to the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation will not be harmed.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, that was Joshua Kimi immediately, even if the additional piece of clothing was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were to be seen, he made himself tied to the arm.
"" "" "" "the coach didn't announce it," "" "said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first mission as a Bavarian Captain." ""
Well, the entry could have been better than at 0: 2 vs the SSC Naples.
But the character of the coach could also suggest Kimi.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player in the C-Elf, born out of youth players, debuts and just out of vacation.
You prefer to distribute sugars to those who want to be in a good mood.
So those who were chosen to take the inheritance of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.
"" "Kimi confirmed:" "" "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility." "" "" ""
On Wednesday the 22-year-old tipped over the field as a mini-lame.
To the right back, that is his position, the white ties on the arm did their rest.
And at all Kimi was in this starting formation like the one who can take the rudder in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the untuned army.
He had a look at the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overplay his missing fitness (folded hard); Renato Sanches thus, on devils come out to join the performances of the Asia-journey (fold also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle avoid falling negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern Trikot.
After all, it worked very well.
Next to Kimi, Rudy was running away from the defences, both acted as confident.
The well-named Napoli storm was often difficult, and in addition, Süle tried a few times in the build-up.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we'd hoped for."
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
"" "game shift, tempo change:" "" "I was also caught up for this style." "" "" ""
As unusually this Bayern world is still for the new entrances, one saw following the game.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two in the catacombs, but six or seven interviews.
Kimi said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
"" "there he heard an interesting phrase from Süle:" "" "what's going on here, I have already noticed." ""
"" "in Bavaria, you just have to win every game." "" "" ""
After all, he doesn't have to teach the newcomer any more.

Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: business praises Wissing Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V inquiry of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
"" "Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says:" "" "Wissing addresses the wishes of the economy, the Lemke has all blocked." "" "" ""
The largest turnaround sees Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the ministry hopes for a planning set-up procedure, until 2021 is supposed to be the building law.
Westumpfung Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country, which is in the urgent need of the federal motorway schedule.
The goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020, says Ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a sign for supporting regional but international competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier strives, as suggested by Wissing, to the wine of a Rhineland-Palatinate-Label, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that has been sagging for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praise the IHK.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new champion bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates in ten years after the master training turn themselves on their own.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts can be created quickly, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Trier.
Until now, only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire sentsing in the state-of-the-art mobility.
The Chamber of Commerce (IHK) is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf's CDU leader, Christian Baldauf, points out calculations made by the Court of Auditors, the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a country's concept of how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had only rated the network supply in an IHK-survey with a score of 3.4.
They complained about stagnant internet connections and breakthroughs.
Former Minister for Economic Affairs, Eveline Lemke, is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where after four months she cleared the field due to inconsistencies.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said the company believes that "there are smarter options as driving restrictions," and referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based - prohibit or limit diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the enterprises as recall.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions.
But nitrogen oxides which emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralisation of exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rejecting the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies try to avoid Volkswagen's faults, which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees were indicted in the United States, others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the study could be heavily overloaded by Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors also participate, a raft travels through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If you go back to the Isar on Saturday, you will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbridge.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building reference wants to clear up.
You can see a big info about the raft on the raft.
It shows a Müllberg.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.

Last summer the raft over the Isar and also this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillos Knollernwort and the laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was one of the most publicized cartoon sketches, the nodbits of his characters are his trademarks.
Also with 85 the Argentinean is still drawing and working on a film.
"" "his message: laughter," "" "For there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist he proposed himself as an artist for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "he said once." ""
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines all around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo characters cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning he is still sitting at the draughtsman and works almost ten hours a day.
On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and clocks, his figures continues to spread throughout the world.
He has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series for six years with his figures.
The main person in Crazy Island's film is a giraffe - Mordillos of any animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which will come to the screen in 2019.
"" "" "" "I don't know exactly what they're saying, it's strange for me," "" "says Mordillo." ""
The script is not written by him.
That is why he rather relies on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change.
The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the illnesses that transmit insects, which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.
This has an effect on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small zikade, a microbacteria that transmits dwarves, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there is much at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowing of the evaporation of the soil, but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The little town Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200 year anniversary this year.
Festival highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medieval Feast.
Krämer, guilds, dealers, vagabonds or a land refugee camp will have to experience these days in the city centre.
The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug warfare.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings reach.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are piled up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.
Among the latter are their editors and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez said in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""
His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamanian.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a Sonder Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders connected with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.
At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and although the terrain is still more traitor.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we mistrustare all." "" "" ""
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumours tend to fly around in Culiacan.
But there is practically nothing to say about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug queens that are bigger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damien Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were accepting that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars equity holdings.
"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxication problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to post harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.
"" "eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria Moors Cabot Award" "" "for her reporting in Latin America." ""
In the same year Valdez gained the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He volunteered to be afraid.
"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." ""
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"" "" "" "you must take over the task that you are assigned to as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy." ""
"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworkers, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Carmen, the bar opposite the office, always sitting at the same table.
Now they ask: was his love for routine his calamity?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive.
"" "" "" "you don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret runways," "" "to move drugs." ""
"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
"" "the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier." "" "" ""
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape changes constantly.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself referred to as untrustworthy.
It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are actually under control.
For the edition of this week, Riodoce focused on three main stories.
There was assassination of the brother of the former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exit to the state expenditures concentrated on the home town of the Governor.
And there was a group staying in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, which led to kidnapping.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the entire century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors were charged with high-caliber cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman kidnapped a military raid.
Only a few months earlier, readers considered Valdez's column as the best informed source about kidnapping.
"" "" "" "earlier we knew what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body stature." ""
"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""
Valdez's office became a storage room for notes and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say it's based on DNA testing that it's his.
"" "in the whole country, journalists have become louder in writing" "" "SOS Press" "" "on walkways and buildings in organized protests." ""
On that day, the director Bojorquez is going away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they said the truth.
"" "" "" "since then she has requested that she be regrouped by the government because she is concerned that her anger violated her objectivity." ""
"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and an incompetent society." ""
In his last book called "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces, who put together the organised crime under a blanket.
"" "last year, the media" "" "Articulo 19" "" "media fan group assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants." ""
"" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""
Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Cetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue what El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who in 2015 was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who go back and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, admitted that drug trafficking frightens him.
"" "" "" "Mexico goes to Hell, and that's why I became a reporter," "" "he said." ""
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootings with rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb edge, they have released the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were afraid, they did not show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"" "" "" "how can you just think about closing," "" "said Bojorquez," "" "if on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street." "" "" ""
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the unbelievable Nashorns of a Canadian mountain farmer were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
It was so well received that they even realized that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had something of an "restless past."
"" "the report in the journal" "" "Current Biology" "" "described it as" "" "the best-preserved dinosaurs ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world." "" "" ""
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosauans living in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years.
"" "his unbelievably well-preserved condition abbaffled researchers who describe it as" "" "really remarkable" "". "" ""
According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil species.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Over the next six years, they spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy soil.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"" "" "" "if you only blindly glimpse a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it had slept," "" "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen." ""
"" "" "" "it will go down into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs." "" "" ""
Researchers have found out that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by dinosaurs eating meat.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shield technique that is known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markedchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.
The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.
It indicates that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the veiling of the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the shading - think of roe deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than booty, indicating that these nodosaurs were exposed to a real fight for survival.
"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have been the chalk time," "" "said Brown." ""
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal on indications of his life, including his preserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor.
At that time Alberta was as warm as Southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther inland than they are today.
"" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved shed skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""
"" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period." ""
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only match a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the Earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that after death Borealopelta sank into the sea and mummed in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.
The creatures had an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that were resting on his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin crust still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, and his five fingers are spread upward.
I can count the scales at its sole. "
In the thunderstorm: mass caramass on A8: many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carbolge.
There are numerous injured, kilometre-long Staus - and Gaffer.
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people have been injured in a mass carambolge on Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, at 17.00 o'clock between the junction stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg), nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into one another.
At first there are no information about the exact number of injured parties.
A police spokesman said it was mild to moderate injuries.
A large range of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In Munich's direction of travel, a ten-kilometre-long way back was formed.
As reported by an AZ reporter, it also happened on the counter-road to massive disability - due to numerous Gaffer.
The fire brigade was the hallmark of the vehicle operators who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident scene.
Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: there's nothing wrong sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant thought.
And then: buffalo.
The conductor comes and wakes a smoothly or tearns the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket inspection.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the perfect ticket inspection.
It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and devaluate the ticket.
Currently, a test run runs on two routes.
"" "" "" "if the offer arrives, we will expand it." ""
"" "it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year," "" "said a railway spokesman." ""
"comfort check-in" is the name of the train without a conductor.
To be able to use this, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do anyway.
It is also necessary to purchase it via the railway, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works like this: you enter the train, call your ticket unter" "" "My Tickets" "". "" ""
A button for electronic devaluation appears in the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant is at number Y at the ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket.
One can therefore continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.
"" "the" "" "check-in" "" "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers." ""
"" "" "" "those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train attendant will simply check in the DB Navigator itself." ""
"" "this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal," "" "says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing management board." ""
"" "second plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" ""
Those who often go by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest offences.
Because often one has, in any case, one of the fellow travelers not all the documents needed for the devaluation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to assign is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the conductor over time to take care of other matters.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that's only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Further train numbers on the same track are not yet unlocked.
"" "as an activist came to learn the answer to the question:" "" "whose Streets?" "" "" ""
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment they rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone.
She stumbled over a post by someone from the High School.
"" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18-year-old child and it is still on the street," "" "he said there." ""
Confused, since nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly relieved on their timeline.
The rapper of the area of St. Louis was killed live on tweets by Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours.
"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "Ferrel thought." ""
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She put off her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of the police band and people crying, and by a man claiming to be Brown's father who bore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed when a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
"" "in another video, she said, another policeman shook his gun and shouted," "" "I will kill you... Animals all" "". "" ""
"" "" "" "this is not usual," "" "Fermrell remembered her statement." ""
"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typically." "" "" ""
At that moment I felt shivers.
"" "I was angry and wept." "" "" ""
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After the landing at 11pm she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
"" "what happened in the next three years with Ferrel and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary," "" "Whose Streets?" "" "in cinemas from 11." ""
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance which consists of people's point of view, who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrel with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation that they had "black experience and black condition" countless times before this morning.
"" "" "" "do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""
"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""
"" "I couldn't take it with me," "" "Fermrell said later." ""
"" "" "" "what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past." ""
It must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves.
Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.
"" "I feel I would be a bad service to keep them away." "" "" ""
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Fermrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrel.
"" "" "" "my activism changed completely after 9 August," "" "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""
"I had no experience in organizing.
"" "everything has come." "" "" ""
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to "document" what happened.
"" "one question came into mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""
Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt Inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrel the project closer together with six other natives, followed by the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we're talking," "" "Davis said." ""
"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, as these people are portrayed, for so I will be portrayed." "" "" ""
The goal was not to focus on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film.
"" "as a result, documents from" "" "Whose Streets" "" "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife." ""
"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "Ferrel said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""
"" "" "" "but I have understood that in this work and in the fabrication of black people there must be a certain vulnerability." "" "" ""
In addition, Ferris's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who have influenced the movie "BlackLivesMatter" in social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify themselves as gay.
"" "" "" "black gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," "" "said Fermackl," "" "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""
"" "black gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""
"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement really is upheld by black women and many black women." "" "" ""
"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action," "" "at which Ferrel was chosen as the heart of the film based on their identity." ""
"" "" "" "she was the person who shook off this energy," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these junctions as a black gay woman is so much at stake." ""
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have disappeared long ago, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist.
Fermrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway during a demonstration.
"" "it describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home:" "" "chaos" "". "" ""
Nevertheless she clings to a chant and she feels obligated to this memory, since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""
It is our duty to win.
We need to love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
"" "from" "" "dream" "" "to megalomania:" ""
The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The issue hardly leaves the subject cold.
"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""
"" "while some say to the bit gallery:" "" "that would be a dream" "" "(Anja Becker) or" "" "that would be really great" "" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "" "does not need a human being" "" "(Siggi Betzen) or simply" "" "megalomania!" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""
While the proponents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the other shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products.
With the beginning of construction work will be finished.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - at Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "for many years we have been buying in the farmers market hall almost every week.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very gladly.
We also discovered the butchery for us.
We would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities, there is also.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery will arrive at the height of the rent.
"" "but this should not be very low in the new project." "" "" ""
Eva Kilic: "what shopping bags in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I don't find it superfluous.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are vacant here - some for months and years.
But as there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, is largely offered directly by the producer and is reasonably priced.
As you can see, stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, special shops don't exist any more and that which is left of it will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all: where should the peasant market hall go down during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit-gallery actually comes at some point.
"" "or does the ghost" "" "bit" "" "gallery already do it before, to distribute all business from Bitburg?" "" "" ""
George Marquet: "it just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmer's market hall thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.
Once the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen pans and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35 year sentence after she publicly disclosed diplomatic notifications about the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and dissipating dissident whose conviction was turned by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharper through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by maning and from the 30 portraits, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment, not only to the extent of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but already spoke openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.
"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""
And she could not attend this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse were turned into unequal letters, which, over the course of two years, exchanged several letters.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoali Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelseas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There are also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further flare the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning concluded with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides following the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how surprisingly similar, at least in biological sense, we are all.
"hopefully, what people will hopefully bring along is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic-novella mentioned above.
It shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free phone in his hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King Kong.
"" "" "" "when they kiss your speech, then they have won," "" "he says." ""
"" "" "" "so never stop your mouth." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "" "said the artist, who sends greetings from Philadelphia." ""
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, from their own genomic simulations that gather like hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.
"" "" "" "in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg from portraits." ""
"" "" "" "I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed by Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation." "" "" ""
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University for Kill
A country-wide human hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford employee, looking for suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died 26, after several engravings.
A public warning system published by the Chicago police agency states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the action, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been in review and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"" "" "" "this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "" "said Cubbage." ""
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investigators in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Administration, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "said Guglielmi." ""
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"" "" "" "we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "" "said Guglielmi." ""
Grand Plaza's management team published an explanation to the inhabitants: "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motifs, including a possible domestic incident."
"we will close the WADA driving plan in the near future" - Mutko, vice-president of Russia
Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
"" "the WADA driving plan was updated in this respect," "" "said Mutko on Thursday." ""
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA driving plan to comply with the code describing the criteria for reinsertion of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
"" "in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has gotten a fault." ""
All measures have been implemented.
"" "but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "Mutkos s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping committee." ""
In conversation with the Russian sales point of rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
"" "no one intends to accept this report unconditionally," "" "said Smirnov." ""
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of doping scandals from the WADA.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli announced that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi does not sell eggs for the time being
These were shared by the company groups.
It was a pure precaution, it could be further assumed by no health impairment, it was said in the announcement.
From now on only eggs can be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven negatively on fipronillegitimate anti-lice attack.
Aldi wanted to establish clarity and transparency with his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company do not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not mourn the process.
"" "" "" "there was never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed." ""
She has summoned people from the outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is at the Wachsen to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, to offer special groups and demographic groups, to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow administrators to bypass the C-Suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.
"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Rett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap polls and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low tuning results - so that you can replicit why.
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won't be the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020 according to the financially innovative Let's Talk Payments website.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the middle of Uber-Feverything in Misskredit.
Cent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
The customer has recently registered as a client.
"" "as Glint, Convercent companies can send customized" "" "pulse" "" "surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas." ""
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that enables employees to report bad behavior.
And if the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion has covered the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." ""
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumers boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track complaints from employees.
Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships identified and addressed more quickly.
"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who manages the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""
"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""
Companies started to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""
"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that gives the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Cent received $10 million in financing in February of firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and managed to finance its entire financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more of their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.
The employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"" "" "" "when people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn who uses both Convercent and Glint." ""
Investors reach yields when their portfolio companies are running well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
Data on employee engagement according to workplace culture experts is important.
But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks staff according to your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and discouraged employees.
"" "" "" "if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data." ""
"" "" "" "for if you don't follow, employees ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""
Do you care about it?
And if you don't care about it, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, so retched.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.
In the case of Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to better binding of employees in a branch that is known for high turnover.
"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""
"and if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for Bruins
It goes on at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA footballers converse on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes constitute a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6: 30.
"" "" "" "this is a real treadmill for the boys," "" "Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday." ""
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and they actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 o'clock in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted six playtimes in Westwood practical exercises.
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during the course of August. 20 before the start of formal preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the change of rules of the NCAA even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players.
"" "" "" "we put this enormous strain on them for three or four days, and it is very challenging," "" "said Mora." ""
"" "" "" "and they simply pushed it through, they still placid themselves, they are great people." ""
"" "I think, as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great." "" "" ""
The UCLA will stop its practice as soon as the camp is over, which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Luskin Center, a upscale hotel that has already been ploughed with footballs, which is a protective net behind a gate post, will not be an easy task.
Brood-Player should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"we will use our security," Mora said.
"" "" "" "this is a real problem, and it is not far fetched to think that people rent a room there and then set up to record an exercise." ""
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I don't worry too much about this.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and show their results in the original article, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. it is one of his efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to facttesters, which may display results of the fact examination from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main award points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly eradicate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in English that a test of the new facts test will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"in addition to recognizing the stories of third parties, people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
A comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 "s and 1980" s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a coshaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"" "" "" "I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says." ""
"" "" "" "what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand." "" "" ""
'A Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering iewicz, Briy May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I have only reacted to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700" s who worked for the Jacobins, "he says.
"this is his thumb print!
And letters always smell smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself is there himself.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome message"), this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape gardening, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started to write."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats told" Oh, throw it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who owned something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.
Guys, let's go all the way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"there is a recording of a rebellion which occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, "Rhodes says.
"" "" "" "the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start." ""
"" "maybe they are connected with each other?" "" "" ""
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the history of the Jesuit pater, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell is represented in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug up).
"" "the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" "" "the gentlemen seemed quite cowardly, always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford." ""
Other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crises, marrying rich old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to attract landlords. "
After the end of his essay in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences
He has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämämäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
"" "it was like:" "" "Oh, now I have to deal with the damned life again." "" "" ""
Campaign launched: over 300 years old Marienkapelle veiled in Rhöndorf
With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, Bad Honnef started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday) on Friday.
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, it is supposed to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Grafenwerth.
"" "" "" "too beautiful for us." ""
"" "or?" "" "the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rhöndorfer chapel since yesterday." ""
"" "" "" "we don't really think this (of course!)," "" "she writes on her webpage shared yesterday." ""
"" "" "" "but we use this measure to attract your attention." ""
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
"" "basically we are convinced that we as Bad Honnef citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city." "" "" ""
"" "in the action, it's about more than" "" "just" "" "a logo and a slogan, it's called on." ""
"" "" "" "it is important to formulate an all-inclusive promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling proposition." "" "" ""
Finally she stands in competition with other communities.
The city of Bad Honnef can afford a mid-five-digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and promotions in the officer corps.
So also this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building, as in the past, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.
The discussions took place under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government, including the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.
Thus the civilians in YAS were in the headcount.
The government attracts the reins in the military.
The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy have been abolished.
Ever since the coup of the coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 Generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wire-puller of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who were to have participated directly in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week.
Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up the armed forces."
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet," published an article entitled "Uneasiness in Military Headquarters."
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the abolition of the headcount ban for soldiers, wrote the paper.
In any case, large-scale purges in the army and security forces continue.
In the middle of July, Erdogan allowed more 7395 soldiers to fire per decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were formerly regarded as the actual masters of the country.
Three times they were putted by calling on their role as guardians of the secular state order.
Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan returns to the military's power step by step, not least by calling on the reform specifications of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan has purposefully advanced an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a named officer, who was seeking asylum from persecution abroad after the coup attempt, warned the Turkish army in a few years "full of extremists and Salafists."
If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Anyway, in the Alliance after the cleansing, there is no doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army.
"" "the management structures and operational skills are" "" "weakened" "", "say NATO diplomats." ""
Washington changes the Green Card rules
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It envisages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"" "" "" "this law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent from other countries Green Cards." "" "" ""
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
"" "this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English which have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," "" "said Trump, quoted by the American media." ""
Ministry wants to recharge circuit for race ticket shuttle
Over the past few months, over the past few months, the future of the race-gate shuttles has been contested - now it should go very fast.
Before the end of the year it is planned to build on the ailing track that runs through the tourist train.
According to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the route is to begin this year in order to secure the future of the road gate.
"" "" "" "with the decision to continue to order and sanitise the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is commenting itself to this especially important link for tourism," "" "explained Minister-Secretary Klaus Technologue on Friday in Erfurt." ""
The costs for the repair of the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country is 75 percent.
The contract, on which the Shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country, is currently being finalised, declared expiation.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as an operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"" "" "" "this means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated" "", "concluded atoning." ""
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years.
This means that the race route shuttle should be ordered regularily in December 2017.
The "Rennsteig-Shuttle" is an especially popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.
Over the past few months, it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation, whether the route of sufficient number of people will be used to order it again in the future.
The track is also partly dilapidated in parts.
The ascension of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it
Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.
Yes indeed.
Sex robots are currently a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"" "" "" "people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""
Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford wife look progressive.
Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed characters such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"" "" "" "Roxxoxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible" "", "enthuses the True Companion website." ""
So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
It also has its moods in the course of the day - just like real people!
"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in spirits" "". "" ""
There are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, is disturbing the most.
On his website True Companion Roxxxes with a vibrator, but for men.
"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxoxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinement point towards something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.
Most men, of course, will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR listens to their rising popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.
But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.
And many people are not odd or insulting until the free market gives them permission.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.
The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the lowed body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistically this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids
Does Trumps have great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind
It has become a trump-certainty of the Trump-era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small-format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.
We are all committed to bursting our filtering bubbles.
Less noted is the power of Trumps to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poetess who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows it, including the republican kinship with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and completely peculiarly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is noticeable in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the horrifying effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.
When we speak of "normalization" and drunkenness, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be repelled.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump republicans the right wing, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.
I find myself today affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both seem to be a very mild criminal offence compared to Trump.
When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars to spend in the city when no caffeine is needed.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are quaint and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely gloomy and the music-permitting music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big roundabout in the north of London.
The Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience since two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40 "s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store was disappointing, while I tired the experience to reach my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a visit to the hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.
Due to murder after an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cab in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he was holding his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say that they are too lenient.
"" "" "" "the National Prosecution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal may be heard this year." ""
Pistorius risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-quarter grinders from Fats and Epfenhofen were discharged into the holiday and in the secondary schools.
Three of the students will go to the secondary school, four to the secondary school.
On Tuesday evening school director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol for school discharge, the 29 pupils of the four classes elected a young eagle, who grew up in the chicken farm, but then released into freedom.
"" "in addition, the lively band performed a musical with the title" "" "The Eagle in the chicken farm." "" "" ""
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it hatch from his chickens.
Instead of chickens, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken from it smashed, the eagles spread out his wings on a high mountain.
Then the classes showed three and four in the rehearsal of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young gockles who bore the cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (chicks) but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a hen.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every four-fourfold changer that he felt accepted in his new school.
There followed thanksgiving to the colleagues, the former schoolmaster Michael Müller, who always jumps with classes of classes, and the parents "representatives.
The chick time is over, explained school teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she was only very reluctant to leave her students, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they can rely on the four-seater.
At the end, all students left a song of summertime and holiday time.
There was great joy with the children.
Eight first-time suppliers have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August a group of illegally camp people was arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while at the moment an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose, substantial fines.
Controls are continued throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: what sufferers need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do Diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion?
An overview of the most important questions and answers.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and Euro 6.
Euro-4-Diesel or worse are exempt from this.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action obligatory?
No, the software updates are optional.
"" "" "" "the obligatory updates before are only valid for vehicles that have Schumann software," "" "says Anja Smetean." ""
The rearmament has been ordered by the Federal Railways Authority (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but not yet called an exact date.
Daimler reported to write to everyone concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be carried out within the framework.
How long should the retrofitting take place overall?
"hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure.
"" "" "" "because we have seen voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far." "" "" ""
How long should the update last?
The conversion could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be time-consuming to get an appointment.
What are drivers that do not drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group?
The ACE reveals to wait.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would prefer Smetanin.
Is there a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel engines so far.
The ACE advises to wait for sale.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize-giving ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners does not want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to get one of the prestigious awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center.
Like the cultural institution on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honourable.
The awards are handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and take part in the award together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear announced with progressive TV series therefore announced to abstain from participating in the gala.
"" "the" "" "New York Times" "" "he said:" "" "this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even withdraw funds - and that is burdening me." "" "" ""
59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will take advantage of the discussion with Trump in order to make clear her view.
The Kennedy-Centre, named after the former president John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
The earlier winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.
The job is already written - however, suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been Stadtbaumeister for the past 31 years.
And the work still gives him great fun, as he mediates in the press talk.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, it is surprising that no application has been fulfilled so far.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
In this way - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time to familiarize yourself with it.
Since Haslach works for the administrative community as a subcontractor, the applicant has to provide corresponding conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they were no longer able to fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
"" "" "" "but closeness to citizens is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate as well as a good mood among the authorities and citizens." ""
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, looking back at the Wacker with pride.
"" "" "" "we make the city worth living," "" "he is sure about the Bauamt and its employees." ""
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the refurbishment of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhof farm ground are about to be initiated.
The kinzigbrücke bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium refurbishment is still a topic.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker appreciates.
"" "" "" "all in all, great tasks await my successor." ""
The work here is fun. "
For a city builder there is a lot of room for design.
With Haslachs's own yard and nursery you can react quite flexibly to many.
"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." ""
As the old town stands under monumental protection as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye on what is fitting" when new buildings are approved, the retiring city builder emphasizes.
Anyway, the city building master bears great responsibility.
"" "he's a builder," "" "in the end everything runs over my table." "" "" ""
He can count on many years of staff for supervision and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
"" "even though his successor remains long, Wacker wants:" "" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place." "" "" ""
Continuity is not only important for a good working environment, but also for the further shaping of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, who would like to bury Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed degree course as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building and planning law.
The Stadtbauamt are under construction and civil engineering, construction guideline, undermining facilities, administration of urban properties, urban facilities with a building yard and urban gardener, as well as Lower Building Law Offices, including monument protection.
Bike thrown on cables: Südbahn clamp locked
According to the police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the railway tracks in the area of Leoben Street (B116).
These were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and are looking for them since the night hours.
A rosary roller driver and a bicycle driver had been observed near the scene.
"" "" "" "this goes far beyond a Lusatian Empire," "" "said ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch to the APA." ""
The perpetrators would have brought themselves into great danger and also endangered trains.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the delay time and the costs for the rail freight transport, patrons of the railway clients could also come to the perpetrators.
"" "overall, a" "" "substantial" "" "sum was to be assumed," "" "said the speaker." ""
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, rail traffic on the Southern Railway Line could be run without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had fallen on Friday morning, two of which were connected to the remote traffic.
Freight trains did not fall out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant colon.
The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are capable of inducing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments we found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan supports tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movements if the same system also works with people.
The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but which was separately accommodated, had not.
They presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial phenomenon of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found which were present in mice with the immune cells, but were lacking in mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand the effects of the bacteria on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us can protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""
Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "
"" "Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a" "" "genius" "" "to Nemanja Matic." ""
At Manchester United, having signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho writes after the midfielder had his debut at Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder's role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
But matic was excluded from the pre-provisioning Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes what Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"" "" "" "we will help him sooner than later." "" "" ""
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments, but insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of its four priority new commitments.

Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle to the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
The radar screen was the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New gravure for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader, S & D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Only a blazing fire from the party headquarters, but no headwinds from the Confederation - was thus the most important desire of the elective warriors.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff from the Willy-Brandt-Haus is watching the events in the SPD-governed provincial capitals.
What Mr Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with the headwind.
There were deep setbacks.
And one by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Greens.
"" "" "" "this shows once again: red-green can simply not be reliable," "" "said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND)." ""
The surprise fraction of a Green Party has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the Parliament election, the red-green coalition lost its single-vote majority to the opposition of CDU and FDP.
"" "" "" "the Green Party executive Michael Kellner has called on the stubborn Low-Saxon Green Party Elke Twesten to return her mandate." ""
"" "" "" "the accession to the CDU means a clear adulteration of the voters" "" "will." ""
"" "Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," "" "said the Federal Minister and Election Director of the Greens to the German editorial network (RND)." ""
"" "" "" "this must not be true," "" "says an electoral champion of the SPD, when on Friday morning the new obsmessage reaches the party headquarters." ""
Stephan Weil, former SPD Chancellor of Lower Saxony, joins the CDU without his own government majority following the accession of the Green Democrat MEPs Elke Twesten there.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD's state associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The mischief began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, more did not soothe the comrades at that time.
After the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It was then - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel led the SPD to wander, the Dusseldorf-Pleite blew the party smoothly.
The comrades had laboriously raped back in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just plucked new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD deputy commander, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communications he did so pretty much everything wrong, what you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz struggles for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW emissions standards and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the criticisms for quite some time now.
The results of this survey were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps because of this, Weil always tried to set accents in the League over the past weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain concealed in Martin Schulz's surroundings.
They allowed him to grant him a stabilization of the party by Weil.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
In doing so, Weil is not guilty of partisan coercion of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And Schulz does not at all.
At times comrades, therefore, try to keep their ranks closed.
Their anger is directed to the Greens, and here especially to the stubborn Parliamentarians Tlifejackets.
"" "" "" "it is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs. Twesten makes her own career choices about the interests of everyone else," "" "says Matthias Miersch, head of party leftists in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the German editorial network (RND)." ""
Mrs. Trash has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person, but has been elected to parliament via the country list of the Lower Saxon Greens, according to the deputies of Lower Saxony.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
"" "Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains an" "" "undemocratic manoeuvre" "". "" ""
"" "" "" "the voters aged four years ago was clear: people made Stephan Weil as Prime Minister," "" "says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a leading candidate in the election of the German Bundestag, the RND." ""
"" "" "" "now, the personal career of a future CDU deputies falsifies the election result," "" "said Oppermann." ""
He called for clarifying the background.
I want to know if there has been more or further commitments made by the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funding for centre III
Those who want to sanitize their home in the years can soon get support from the country.
In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives spoke urban development on Wednesday in sensations.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what happened so far.
Since 1991, there are renovation areas in sensitive areas.
At that time, in the I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.
In the II period from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "achievement project" - it is finally important to foster the development of the interior, and not only to open up new areas of construction.
On April 4, the government presidium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a restructuring area III.
The funding amount was 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euro came from the country, the rest of the community felt sensitive.
How does a sanitation area develop?
"" "one will, according to Schindler, investigate where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""
But it also plays a role whether in the planned area there is any interest whatsoever to rehabilitate.
If necessary, the area borders could be postponed again.
On Wednesday evening, the bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
"" "Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Programme" "" "Social City" "", "where the restructurings would then be carried out." ""
Core of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out in an object-related manner, i.e. per property.
The refurbishment area would then finally be defined as statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the authorisation period for the funding is ongoing until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the survey would only be carried out, as part of those participating in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out.
In November or December, the purpose of the sentence is to take place as far as possible, so that the restructurings can begin next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every commune must carry out the forecasted pre-examinations.
It is a question of assessing urban development and deciding when it will be rehabilitated and to what extent.
There is also a remark in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann would even come back to sensations and get a picture of the situation she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the project was a key success factor for the project.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays.
"" "the yellow questionnaire is the" "" "building and property sheet" "", "which includes, among other things, the structural condition and the restructuring measures." ""
"" "in the gray questionnaire, the" "" "Household and Housing Chamber" "", "data on size, division and residents of a residential area can be made." ""
"" "the blue" "" "business arch" "" "can only be filled out when premises are operated in the building." ""
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible for funding.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of the subsidies according to the "greyhound principle" - who comes first, admonishes first.
You can't reserve subsidies for later.
"" "finally, photos of the project" "" "local centre II" "" "were shown, in order to make" "" "tasty" "" "to those present." ""
British inventor adopts himself a microchip to get in house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisor Anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional cost of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The whats of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers according to the military that has been left to TIME magazine up to $24,000.
The green-white sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a Maine Yacht, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fork-lift truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Bureau called for the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the HMX-1 commander on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy commander of the aviation.
The news showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3 o'clock in the morning, and so it remained until the lawns were cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours.
The original aircrew was during the event with the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane.
From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required.
The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt destiny.
"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commandant wrote.
"" "" "" "sounds like you're locked," "" "answered the deputy commander." ""
"" "the event" "" "Made in America" "" "was designated as official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act." ""
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform, which was in progress in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb the government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But to demand their use only for a photo op is unusual.
In February, Trump conducted an investigation when the presidential aeroplane ahead of his first Kampagnenrallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services rendered, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of the presidential aeroplane by its predecessors.
"" "" "" "the White House is thrilled with the show" "" "Made in America" "" "- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," "" "said the assistant secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters." ""
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn to depose the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landing in the White House.
"" "the flight for the" "" "Made in America" "" "event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official." ""
"" "Helikopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for" "" "non-presidential support missions" "". "" ""
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is however 24,380 USD per hour.
Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refunds is most misleading," "" "said Walters." ""
"" "" "" "these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are contained in the annual means." "" "" ""
According to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of contract.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"" "" "" "the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," "" "said Spicer." ""
"" "" "" "and I know Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it." ""
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course, it is appropriate to highlight that. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss in front of tricky task
The runner-up of the second division of Tennis-Bundesliga kicks off at the SV standings in the standings.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow at 11 o'clock in Kiel at the SV table third.
Despite the five games still flawless balance, the leader of the second tennis Bundesliga has maintained the sense of reality.
In any case, Team Principal Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"" "" "" "this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation." ""
"" "right at the rear positions I find the crew very good." "" "" ""
For class and stability at the Suchsdorf SV mainly imports from the high north provide.
"" "" "" "their roofs and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup." ""
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerghus (all Denmark).
"" "" "" "it is as always hard for us." ""
"" "you also need a good deal of luck." "" "" ""
The Neusser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman currently still active in the Challenger Tournament in Biella's Italian Biella is not part of the Bundesliga game, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), playing at the competition in the Czech Liberec, will be his first bet in this season.
The previously undefeated guitarist Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevsky at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
He was supposed to be at the same time as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the Club at the Alster, Máté Valcirz could again move back to the team.
If it is enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016, someone fills the cadre from the trainer around Marius Zay.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law banning sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"" "" "" "in his haste to issue the law," "" "the Congress put in a few" "" "unconstitutional provisions" "", "he said." ""
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming US advance.
"" "" "" "after all, the draft plan to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines in the EU." ""
Since then, investors in the local OMV are concerned, which co-funded the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea division North Stream 2 together with other European companies.
The drones are huge.
However, it is too early for an estimation of the consequences, such as the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump itself would have to raise the sanctions by an executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.

Roll back: the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita-lunch table itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban nurseries, the watch is turned back.
On 1 September Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban nurseries (Kitas) again in self-control.
"" "for Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare department, this is a good news:" "" "we were all very pleased." "" "" ""
Cooking is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh gekoks chilled.
The city operates 46 kindergartens in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at noon.
Last year there were 2800 children sitting at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"" "" "" "meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 days of the week, in the Kita at noon," "" "explains Pomerania." ""
"" "" "" "the offer is also valid for 35-hour supervision, if children stay until 14 o'clock." "" "" ""
46 part-time employees have kitchen service from September 1: they warm up the supplied food, supplement them with salad, raw vegetables and fruit, divide the meal individually, give away the food, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"" "" "" "the employees are assigned to a kita," "" "says Pommeranz." ""
The size - there are two grouped as well as seventeen units - decides on the hourly range.
"" "" "" "the kitchen helpers now belong to the Kita-Team," "" "Pommeranz said." ""
"" "" "" "so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement pedagogical concepts." "" "" ""
This is why it is all about healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"" "" "" "children should help prepare food." "" "" ""
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable.
Also for the children.

This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the ita spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance, also has the charm that it has shown itself in the price comparison between self-regie and foreign awarding for the city as the most economical one, it is stated from the Press Office.

GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to ascertain the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in the case of managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
McVities owner Plai said he has invested over 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "first learn" if their activities would change.
"" "in a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's call for" "" "voice concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward." "" "" ""
GMB Senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "the fact that we can't gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the large-scale Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic conditions of production, the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed by a flourishing production presence in McVitie. "
"" "a spokeswoman for Pladi said:" "" "the branch manager at Tollcross has only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will react directly to it, as we value the continuous commitment among employees and trade union representatives." ""
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "over the past few years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a place of production fully and entirely. if our operational processes change at the location, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this. "
Did the PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar three years ago?
The page of La Liga might regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave Neymar's persecution after having left an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years before the record of the world record?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning for 89 million pounds in the past season to Manchester United.
After its completion, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a spring near the Catalan presidency is insisting that the club always has its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City held an interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"" "" "" "I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," "" "said Al-Khelaifi." ""
"we respect all clubs.
"" "but if they try to let one of our players sign in, this will have consequences." "" "" ""
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish Association keen to express interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Scooter is turned and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a scooter in the royal fields street in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused damage of over 200 Euro in the disguise of the vehicle.
The police Schramberg, tel. 07422 / 27 01-0, ask for hints.
For an accident at the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his lane, the driver had to evade a VW Touran and toured the guard rail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum arrived with his VW at the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese on the B 215 from Stolzenau.
In the area around Stolzenau, a passenger car came to meet him on his lane so he had to retire to the right.
The Touran driver toured the guard rail.
Material damage was created on the passenger car.
The driver of the coming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident damaged, it can be good that the car driver hadn't noticed the accident.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissariat in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope's Brother George Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.
Christian Weisnder, Spokesman of the Reform Movement "We are Church," declared after publication opposite the German press agency, he received an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret through their own omissions or their then false estimation of the processes.
"" "the Vatican City newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised the fact that when reporting about violence in the cathedral sparrows," "" "two measures" "" "were measured." ""
In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts," which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but conspicuous is the "degree of media manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scarafia, Historian and Member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.
"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the daily experience and is preparing the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarafah." ""
Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and it's a devout fresco."
"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "stripes were a normal educational tool" "", "" "" "to get done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""
It would be unfair to apply today's standards for the past decades, for the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, pope-brother George Ratzinger often appeared.
"" "author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages), is totally wrong." ""
"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""
What exactly is the 440 page report submitted by Ulrich Weber to the Enlightenment by the Bistum Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburg dome-sparrows were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen, sexually abused.
In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by R. Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.
Especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment for the students could also be more violent.
"" "nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him, despite violence." "" "" ""
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen George Ratzinger is relieved.
"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence in protection of protection at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""
"" "on the one hand, many students stand out for" "" "humanity" "". "" ""
On the other hand, he also appears as a choline clerk and perfectionist, who has become more palpable when a cathedral sparrow has no top performance musically.
How can you evaluate this final report as its biographer?
Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.
There are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or sympathy in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Even the excesses of violence at the pre-school took place outside of his sphere of influence.
One can reproach him at best, learn from it too late or have taken the first hints at least seriously enough.
"" "the gymnasium on which he was working was felt by virtually all respondents as" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""
Thus, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also portrays him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by children's grapes."
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks.
The fact that he not only knitted with chairs and threw the key ring on the floor, but also distributed ear cowardly and cheeky boys to the hair or ears, he even admitted to years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.
To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fray times, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.
Do you still know such cultivation methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced it in a secular school, a state grammar school.
Compared to what is actually in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excessive consumption of violence in the preschool, they are certainly Bagatellen.
One wonders if it is not with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen on him.
Many who have never understood him are still eagerly working on the Bavarian pope.
But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, in connection with the report a lot has been reported about abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger be subjected to any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were initiated.
"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "" "said one of the affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""
The real issue in the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then surely not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?
"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "concerning sexual abuse... I see... in no case where he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the offenders." ""
I consider it... also for really absurd, to assume that... Buys have opened intrusive or more clearly or rather than opposite their parents, boarding managers, trust teachers, etc.
"" "talking to him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""
"" "thus the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of every sympathy.
So he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad.
Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradictory crimes, as happened in some cases unfortunately.
"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "could be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""
"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: that's the big issue that everything was mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge gang of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.
But this is precisely the misuse of the report.
There is a clean separation between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses, as well as, let's say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral leader of the cathedral sparrows.
The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were seriously harassed and painted, all of them took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled out.
But with those, Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger had nothing to do because he only got the boys face when they were already on the cathedral square gymnasium.
"" "on this, as most witnesses emphasize, the subject" "" "Pre-school" "" "taboo." ""
You were only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.
What was different on the gymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not a sadistic authority.
"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""
So at the most is the reproach that they have looked away.
But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the proceedings at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only about 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger strictly shut the ears in front of the states?
Michael Hemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral square gymnasium, which even reproduces the report.
"" "in this he points out this," "" "that in the preschool the punishment would continue to be practised." "" "" ""
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as asceasers were forbidden in Bavaria long ago.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows yet.
It was difficult for him to estimate, where the persons affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.
But you can't say that it would always have looked away.
This simply is not true.
Only in 1980 examinations were officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.
How do you see this?
"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "so the danger of evaluating the past by today's moral standards." ""
The princess already was right.
But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was horrible at all times and also not for what was breached in the preschool against adversity and violence against innocent child souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.
That's all awful and I'm glad that it will finally be worked up.
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishment, thus earnestly and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was banned, he kept himself strictly adhering to it.
"" "which picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "has shown Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""
Was the subject "Prüfer-punishment" also a language?
Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI said from his perspective, that the dome-cats only played a side-role.
Nevertheless, I do not at all concede that he led a strict regiment there.
But even this has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, the unruly boy makes no great singer and success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced over and over again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of whom you can't imagine that he could do just a fly.
I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emerioration, regularly get in touch with him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.
And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but it was also a respectful respect to which they are still gazing up and who are downright admitting them.
And please, once more clearly: everything you submit to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
For the report that has just been published is relieving him.
Now the status would be, a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace.
