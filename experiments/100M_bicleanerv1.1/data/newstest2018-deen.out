Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a chapel that is now dig@@ ging for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the erst@@ while reason of farmers .
Munich &apos;s oldest official card promotes exciting stories for days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows this , who had to get upset already , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the Digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer by the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very insi@@ ghtful .
especially when compared to current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ eting carpet , which one does not recognize as such .
in the large picture postcard , detailed maps , so @-@ called primary position sheets , were worked into for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian survey management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - naturally for military purposes .
even if the French troops were finally depar@@ ting with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
Elec@@ tor Max . Joseph further pushed the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management .
the prim@@ eval sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all the others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling became 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser until 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primitive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots of land do not occupy any farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in the Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the prim@@ eval sheet , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the height &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one used to lock people with lun@@ atics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich @-@ based district @-@ asylum @-@ asylum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden conducted the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive in his time and , for example , ended the bet@@ ting of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel to employ violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who was engaged in an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients it was initially allocated space , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotor ren@@ aissance institute in hair 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost in 2006 , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um encounter each other on the premises of the former Au@@ er institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , East residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in architectural all@@ usion to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance institution , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a great one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ up will take place .
with the sli@@ der the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights group publishes Travel alert for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Federation for the Promotion of Col@@ ours has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based incidents occur in recent times across the state and can be noted here , &quot; stated in the opinion of the Group .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination suits , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities , who dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , caused the group to issue the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group quoted events such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the trip through the state and was put into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Bureau of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , where it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state are being hal@@ ted 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing if they bring Cau@@ tion money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting program of the FB@@ I , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations on the 16th place of the country .
the warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , following the adoption of immigration laws that obli@@ ge local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which , according to AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further ra@@ cial profile .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on site .
representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s CD@@ U regional association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the Pi@@ v@@ emet@@ ry Court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his operation , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , provides 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens and houses five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative for him for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ e@@ este , only region@@ als arrive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the chairman of the B@@ L@@ H@@ V fisher@@ man &apos;s bach , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t manage to work profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gr@@ ass@@ land area for a lot of work , much has to be processed with the sense of brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not conduct a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad of the leaders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ estation of the land could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the area of preservation is 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
the farmers therefore remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of soft @-@ fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape care line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state support of soft f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor belt recorded by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be fenced may not be more pper@@ y ( slope inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ous project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the area of ownership corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is accepting the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restrict legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue by himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty is@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he attacked its meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller asked A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly speaking right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contem@@ por@@ aneous response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , the mis@@ erable decay of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable garbage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends , who used to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical representation .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives , who brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves forward .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch will not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has encountered something here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch will not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black announces Scottish members of the Great Britain Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power director of the UK athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ Recorder - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain by the team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her talk was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete with the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les in her fifth world champi@@ onships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ range runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year has set five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man that you should watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their fellow coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team@@ mates voted for me and elected me , it makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team .
it just shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
concerning my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are in the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the burning of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles .
he sli@@ pped in the criticism , for sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ple@@ aded him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval by the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in directing his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ press his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spo@@ k@@ es@@ man Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just genuine people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some more than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times , if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or silence prot@@ esters .
but this is exactly what happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it shouldn &apos;t be that hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable portable had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied in between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters came to his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters of newspapers that settled Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his position , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses form the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort during the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led up to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field last year , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built and we see how it reached its fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who after his 50@@ th birthday this year returned to the European Senior Tour this year , returns to the action at home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad , as far as it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) arrive in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher study director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic since 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are more or less in time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which repeatedly ham@@ pers the construction work , is a big problem for the construction company of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red lights and barrier grids is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the regular buses were allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ele in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs its daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work too late : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to be voted in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which revol@@ ted for independence from Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is desolate . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated iron roofs that were converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans learned a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Hill , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port reduced its worth of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units of almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal high@@ lands in the 1970 &quot; s have been committed to the genocide according to the Asian human rights commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ der Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese in 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 33 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have begun selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai natives , who moved to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the mo@@ m mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to tackle ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his 2014 election campaign .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Pap@@ ua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai only suffered two months after Jok@@ the@@ is &apos;s initiation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers offen@@ ded their tone and came back with four soldiers later , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ f@@ le bombs , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ uli@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the orph@@ an dance - running in circles and im@@ i@@ dating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to hur@@ l stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers through an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said the official document of TI@@ ME that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , lots of shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who was witness to shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings occurred only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ the@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it won &apos;t happen again in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , Minister of Defence , said in October 2016 that he should establish an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism to settle historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , which the UN has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ del@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead bodies , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned while fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured people have been delivered quickly , like the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ y@@ ai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parliament has called to account for the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a fraud for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal families Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by raising spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty increases dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua seldom have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission for filming was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March , six Pacific States - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ta N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Committ@@ ees , &quot; says Go@@ bai , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is found in poor educational and health services .
Go@@ bai states that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ation , the victims of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims took up a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the dead bodies of a victim were buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers of Dubai for the second time
a fire on Friday took place in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is by coinci@@ dently called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( torch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the shou@@ ting of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who attacked his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4@@ am local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooling down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident may revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor environments of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has failed to attend the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposed for this sport was a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two sets of profits , thin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics , the traditional competition is maintained .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to settle the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to perform less official press dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among airlines carried out that more than 20 percent of the US Transportation Security Administration s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed by deliberately prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while using in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they were late to discover that they had mistakenly flown with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a Jet Charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers were more likely to dis@@ regard the rules .
among those surv@@ eyed admitted that they unknow@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent of the mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent admitted to have know@@ ingly borne containers by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it surv@@ eyed travellers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed ware by airport security and how many things they had intentionally done .
it is no surprise that the people who wear s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear safety , those who fly the most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA directives are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take with them or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed ware .

&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , he has under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal a different , less brilliant figure for the first time on the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
during the past few months , Mus@@ k had become more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
now , Mus@@ k has dre@@ amed : of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 had already been withdrawn .
critics repeatedly pointed out that these are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations have been made , Mus@@ k cleaned up in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 cars .
by 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 in 2020 , one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 bookings available per day .
who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery early in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization in practice .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if it comes to major delays , then the liability of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EP@@ O leader P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ treats because of the withdrawal of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is a deadline for States on October 1 to comply with the standards of O@@ zone in 2015 .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of rigor@@ ous environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to blocking or del@@ aying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EP@@ O often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion of the EP@@ O stated that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually exploit his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive re@@ version of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States who filed the EPA this week , said the group wanted to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reverse of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when contam@@ in@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , helping thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ gation &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Register : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the hill with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen / Germany and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ our Hill , apart from the former parish church , there was also a magnificent court that belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as described in the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , the &quot; mountain &quot; was the third , the village centre of the village , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen .
ancient maps from around the year 1600 reinforce these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age emerged from the early medieval self @-@ Church right .
the owner of this church remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .
connected with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the elder of the two collap@@ sed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church mill and used them as fire@@ wood .
the ruins of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half fell .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ bach and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ mer maintain the Hil@@ arius system as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by Com@@ bo des Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
at the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers provide fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade is held only in dry weather .
the organizers hope many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is important for tum@@ ors and hearing aids .
friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal pre@@ condition for construction and has therefore turned to the Council of the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in principle , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible within this concentration zone , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are meant to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ agus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government in Düsseldorf had not authorized the city of Vier@@ sen because of a mal@@ function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval certificate is still illegal and therefore also rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ aves &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been dealt with since last week in the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes them as an occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
however , they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW AG , is planning to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim niche .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area .
with the establishment of four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be covered , which corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ channel households .
the NEW Re @-@ intends to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , the City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally injured .
two more people were injured .
the state road was closed for hours .

city and dealer planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; -@@ weekend will make the customers aware of what offers the own city provides apart from the usual supermarket commodity .
according to the plan , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their apprentices@@ hip positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action aims not only for residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the promotional week , are Christian König .
municipal administration and commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
in this way , the industrial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts to make them active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened again or again .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - up to land@@ lords , the enterprises of the whole city and clubs .
it was time for King in the spring to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that took part in a network of le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities will take part in the national @-@ wide &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

Tr@@ ump translated into le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump asked En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to stop public speaking that he would not pay for a planned border wall in a telephone conversation with the Mexican president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President reb@@ elled because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his campaign campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to leave Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who mig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by Obama &apos;s government would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es emerged to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fers &apos; suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
luckily this terrible scene , played on July 22nd , is just a night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck is thrown by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them crowd out very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really unbelievable that in all these years not one single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of the night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a medi@@ ator puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FB@@ I files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch action throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer election campaign .
approximately at the same time as the election stab@@ bed according to the FB@@ I of black farmers Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore didn &apos;t belong to her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in mur@@ ders , pro@@ ofs of evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a right to vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is clear , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of which want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest black - pressed into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief cello player for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ by Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ding that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ cona respon@@ ds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers were swe@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship sh@@ akes the discomfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ mus@@ sen says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots , and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed with a dress dress , stands above the bodies of the actors and introduces Bil@@ lie Holidays &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as &apos;s oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial places of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , record the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks out with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience co@@ operates with the actors for dinner .
at one table , a white pair of Atlanta talks about the reproduction with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski is struggling to find words that have left the performance behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and who do so because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really works with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delivery is inspiring in a way as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf uses a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a scre@@ aming street corner including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Plastic and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from East Germany or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhine kill@@ ers pose as rock energies , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil drums remind of Cast@@ or &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhine kill@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
k@@ ess Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) dec@@ eive Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , pull a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ pin@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally the scene when he s@@ miles Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are stor@@ my , who humble himself and for@@ c@@ efully bows his hands to the Chancellor .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat in casual leisure clothes .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
in 2013 , he had still had to leave behind a g@@ ellas pipe concert , there were five years later a great jubil@@ ation in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went underground .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is pleased to have enjoyed this .
&quot; it is noticeable that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also grew an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive summary .
Max crowd works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the Fur@@ niture Fair , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with that ?
crowd : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
crowd : I graduated from high school .
and then a civil engineering study , we say , successfully broken off .
for me , I realized that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it really is on the spot , at the focal point .
and was it so ?
crowd : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably doing a social worker training at the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not something unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
what &apos;s different from a civil engineering course ?
crowd : sure , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one always has other people head , each having a completely different story behind him .
whether a refugee or a teen@@ ager has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
crowd : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will start to overcome the pressure that the company faces .
the job sh@@ edding that General Director John Fall@@ on announced largely for the end of 2018 and early 2019 is in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in a third cost reduction program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to its partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed at suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , said officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , declared an explanation by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a Her@@ at mos@@ que on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; man carried impro@@ vised explosive &quot; sentence . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram airport .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first six months of 2017 , of which some 20 % were in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had conducted this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the city center killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Tali@@ ban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Decision to Del@@ ay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of Obama &apos;s government , according to which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states accused the Agency for the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to push ahead with the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Pro@@ visions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to work with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the EPA &apos;s intention to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where inc@@ isions must be made in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of the Democrats and nature protection groups , who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the website of the EP@@ O says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants common room
at the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two counter@@ parts , the community council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ner decided to set up a community space in the future retirement home .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , it will take a long time until the area belongs to the community , but there is no plans for planning a project that would be planned by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space of some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are floating in such a common space not as a meeting place just for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ orial living , but openly entering into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet@@ ening is the decision which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn by means of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
the installation of a community room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , capable of supporting 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed decision to sign@@ alize the investor is that in this respect no bil@@ lets will be thrown between the legs , the finding that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding building - as well as pitch roof - which reduces the height of the tr@@ unks and makes the construction more economical - could be possible .
unnecessary , so does not only mean Wil@@ fried sole , be this addition .
when it helps : it happens unanim@@ ously to the body .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which one does not come so well , but now they lean at the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very busy with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden payout to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but a real , in doubt market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
three pro@@ pon@@ ents will find the request to apply the resolution accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains the same with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we grasp the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the street
when crossing the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer road .
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver who was driving in the same direction gave him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car , which controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a return carriage .
FC Bayern Munich has to ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup on Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup is taking place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
human resources at the German Football Record Champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger and bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without a du@@ el with the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , that was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory match of the season .
football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 viewers , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
hiking in the Harz Mountains to Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nation @-@ wide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emerge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the plan of the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg ( Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg ) .
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is contrary to the information needs of many visitors of the har@@ z@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels should be added via the internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path Ticket will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewer experience a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars had different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it was far from distant .
it also conve@@ ys in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association already operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with a naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned Star@@ light - the Plan@@ etary Trail in the university city since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Gemeinde Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ ele with the individual planets - including the degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun standing exactly 75 meters measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun up to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next star @-@ star , however , would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ar@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ar@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing organization Super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ year @-@ world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both Fi@@ ghters are members of the top @-@ five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ar@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ar@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 l@@ bs &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to lightweight .
and he has to move to light weights &#91; 135 Po@@ unds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ar@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ar@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to schedule a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell , after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later insist@@ ed on fighting on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he loved Lom@@ ar@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday combat .
but Lom@@ ar@@ enko was grateful to Gar@@ cia with his generous praise and said that he thinks the three @-@ battle champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show drummer , then boxing .
they both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle achieves so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ar@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injuries to ire plat@@ ter
during an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point at 4.@@ 30 a.m. shortly before the connection point .
the car shifted to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured through the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be diver@@ ted to the accident scene .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; the supply chain works better &quot;
after 2 : 2 and@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener of Braunschweig to point out the optimisation of the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result , too , were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was too much for two opponents , and we have to pay better attention in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fort@@ una Du@@ essel@@ dorf def@@ end@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a kick @-@ off , the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation with the supply chain , his team is better able to cope better than with the supply chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; said his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his cause , &quot; because we are in the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Fo@@ el@@ mann , who can build well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are working even better and we do not make so many f@@ laws in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failure from a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can get four points on Sunday and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I only rated the start in the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascension favor in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland place as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Application Test published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ ky@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started conducting the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of age more accurate , after the Swedish Migration Committee ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 tests to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person exceeds 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest@@ ing that the person under investigation is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det evaluated the 5@@ 81 published results , she discovered that in 243 of these cases the person frank@@ ly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , x @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological age of humans to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say safely , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is minimal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete sla@@ b on the bridge was installed at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Traffic at the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three renovation need@@ ing bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and it is sure that the schedule will be comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , crosses the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach reached a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge on Wednesday morning on the north side .
this is a border fast@@ ener , which is also used as an operating way .
a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge crane is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday .
then the pedestrian path is to run .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridges .
a special feeling of intuition has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fiber optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ sets about the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
traffic is controlled by traffic lights for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting way in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction works on the bridge at the entrance to the village of Lau@@ ter@@ bacher , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
it is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the District Day Vol@@ can@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag on this day , because the Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; Great Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n . &quot;
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the deputy chair Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ athletes but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned at the fountain square , but is now taking place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus right in front of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is music and a lot of food , including a &quot; ancient potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ ic Eifel reports that he tried to make such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially questioned in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because there were not enough parking spaces available due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ elle , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 8 p.m. on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the audi@@ torium , who wait for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 9@@ pm .
the police can move on - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the tro@@ mb@@ one tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be present in the series of Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ mari@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held sol@@ op@@ positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov solo trumpet player at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo soprano of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both united the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
thus Johann Sebastian Bach sings in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz cat@@ cher N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play merge into a fascinating total artwork .
this core piece of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it for the two musicians and still more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheeses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brunette protagon@@ ist ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I have ever recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten said they were bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I only liked it never to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school age , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , sc@@ ared and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they do not like to explain their love life to the public : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to react to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as citizens of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I &apos;d say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice endor@@ sed not the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final refusal of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , convincing message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin told during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been med@@ d@@ led with gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships , starting on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , announced on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re@@ unification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited coaches are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tragedy for soldiers who had died in Mali
during a funeral service in F@@ ritz@@ lar , North H@@ ess@@ ische F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
as Minister of Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , Minister of Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite drivers but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice made by them in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ expose Cathedral of St. Peter on Thursday .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
ro@@ ses laid down , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church F@@ ritz@@ expose and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the in@@ filtr@@ ated soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cr@@ amped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann used the flight operation of the combat helicopter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six educated Tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show that the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued to speak .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the &apos;s accession to the throne in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; princ@@ ely supp@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by declared , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bl@@ eman , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife &apos;s sympathy for the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of Society critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to re @-@ election quickly
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of a potential majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the parliament &apos;s resolution on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from its parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close one @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition of CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U leader , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler , wants to recommend his group to record them .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected as scheduled on January 14 next year .
Th@@ um@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the country &apos;s day as quickly as possible decides its self @-@ dissolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the parliament &apos;s parliament draws the trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

she described herself as a bearer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that she returns her country mandate from the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen exceedingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she consciously decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we can &apos;t understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of Lower Saxony &apos;s Green @-@ Democ@@ rat MEPs El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters but also treas@@ on to red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bundes@@ rat of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the parliament .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and attempts to make political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U leader , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler , wants to recommend his MEPs to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the German Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ rash of fal@@ si@@ fying the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U at that time before the SPD was strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament day .
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses inf@@ ested eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speaks and answers .
Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery @-@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all that we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded .
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economy ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately turned up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since we became acquainted with Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
retailers are concerned just as manufacturers have to ensure that the sold products are transpor@@ table and health safe .
if the residual value of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants are not directly responsible .
on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage on the basis of alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too little controllers in the case of serious seri@@ ousness .
is there only a lack of personnel or a conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
precisely for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be available are of decisive significance .
I have already made clear several times that I am awaiting a complete enligh@@ tenment by the responsible authorities .
is regular er@@ as@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the pan@@ elled funds , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are confronted with a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be informed promptly and without gaps .
how the Financial Reg@@ ulations of Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed issues from European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must eventually prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money in order for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the host family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to use legitimate sources of income that allow them to break the break even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to club debts to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three years FF@@ P default period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favor of the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are away from excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely increase the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week .
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue for the next five years will be in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of EU pen@@ alties in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ist company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship &apos;s value was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be due to payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambass@@ adors are going to become such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more aware of every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the conditions of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not entitled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose society is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga Against a State that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is at the end of a possible end : the airline writes the order again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ speaking speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 17 million small @-@ and @-@ white , red @-@ and @-@ white plastic sheets spread over 14 grams a year before landing on the passengers before landing .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the advertising effect is more important : for a sco@@ op manufacturer , it is a prestigious job .
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate boards have been distributing Swiss flights since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss made a contract with the daughter Mig@@ ros , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss made the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the first class customers will be indul@@ ged with treats from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class bags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short stretch , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes both business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a du@@ ly jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by bra@@ cing at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids who grow up - still managed to win back the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cra@@ ck@@ les the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , one character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , still has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another mad @-@ evil plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good visual impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s under@@ lip of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are being played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues will be du@@ b@@ bed by Ch@@ anning Gest@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching TV watching how Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like one .
with six long episodes , it runs away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was edited on a lower length , could better supply his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re since Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
strike against Dru@@ gs @-@ Ma@@ fia in the Land
the police managed to blow up the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor told Kon@@ stanz on Friday .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued warran@@ ts of arrest .
in addition , the officials treated larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
with the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects of Italy .
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investigations were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in action .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised crime , heavy violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the investigation focused mainly on Italian nation@@ als with a close relationship with the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a pub early in the morning , should go to the bank &apos;s account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way compl@@ ains big gaps in the foreig@@ ner register &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ judgement in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e Management of the German Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to a large gaps in the country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , warned the way in an analysis of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nation@@ alities were recorded in the register , among them 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been properly maintained , the data quality in parts had not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data entries can considerably slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also gr@@ asp@@ ed , who wouldn &apos;t have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these false assignments , however , led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with ex@@ cre@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. , in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have come from there .
the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; reports from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper therefore states that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF takes such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , as the paper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful admission conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ fen@@ bach were already available to the blood don@@ or service for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
first of all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , the congregation acknowled@@ ges multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood in the council &apos;s meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our bodies are created for it , and we are respect@@ ful of the don@@ ors of respect that their blood is available for strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the round@@ about leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the cann@@ ed are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants only a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ berry were counted among multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many reserve Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ litres of their life juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish as it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of a strengthening pressure .
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members pursuing a rise this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on domestic revenues would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but she sign@@ aled that in the next few years rate increases would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the costs of credit might have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business stimulus package issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that now it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion .
after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary for cooling inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ asted growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is likely to recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor increases in wages , as the tigh@@ tening is getting worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the in@@ comes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages are going to recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; towards the end of its three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the pound .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected to attract it over the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in proportion to their target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the recent withdrawal of Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders are looking for businesses looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in the N@@ HS after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sexual preventive pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to fund the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling stating that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 in all of England .
pre@@ position pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV agents taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission at risk of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , suitable candidates are identified which agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract for delivery of medications this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence of how it is used and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now is to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Sh@@ adows , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that they will contribute to bringing a step closer to the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the Big Life : mezzanine and clever designer @-@ tricks have turned this Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former owner of real estate , shr@@ unk from a big Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge house to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack her bags and sold her .
&quot; before , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet have been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous sla@@ b height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed von Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF panel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that when you push the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a vesti@@ gi@@ al form , a real estate agent will enter and execute a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square met@@ er@@ value of some standard in something completely amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a USD 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in an argument because of one of Victori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate empire worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and Developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business capacity should be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
the West co @-@ je@@ ans family grew up there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as the &quot; master operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - owns about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a legal file says that this means that Col@@ in owns $ 316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has been a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the units proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed negotiations .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - which Col@@ in , as Paul says , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of in@@ compet@@ ently managing some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Mr@@ s De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans @-@ load of the family .
Col@@ in says he started with West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to trial , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the AF@@ L and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and to dress our sur@@ name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps is planning to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly really can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new White House Chief of Staff , met with senior employees on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s White House that he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship with television ranges back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February over Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit@@ ual under control , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials don &apos;t know what we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more ignition without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump hasn &apos;t sent .
if his co @-@ workers manage to keep anno@@ y@@ ance from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented any conten@@ tious controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ tico - dealing with this story - reported in May about the advis@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preference to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that dr@@ unk@@ ers like a volcano can react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he is eager to find out where these come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ane , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ iced it .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; attempted to implement a system for managing and docum@@ enting the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as a Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be requested and hoped .
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
as the addresses of the searched heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar of the Winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many volati@@ le places hide in holiday destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
we have put together 21 post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ation@@ . more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website .
Travel@@ ers negotiate about a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords in the West of Mid@@ lands are standing again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the base of war , who have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn from the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they carried horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were released in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded to Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last lap of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls police . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move forward as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior with the police , calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambience operating company l@@ t@@ d. until 13 April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the county .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers at the house .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again into a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt @-@ object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , building sh@@ utt@@ les have been in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is carried out .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings are broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything was to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
the swimming pool , the wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher centre level , sh@@ aver emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , is to be set up wide , sh@@ ear@@ ches further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel .
he had talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer says .
the city &apos;s performances are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define himself precisely .
almost under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior installations are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us special negoti@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Ambassador Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee has begun work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the cause of familiar persons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster reported that there are already initial invitations by the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have been pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ed with in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focuses on several men who acted in the election campaign as consultants of the Republi@@ can .
according to reports Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more dr@@ um@@ ps in private and business environments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special issu@@ er Tr@@ ump came to the centre personally and examined the accus@@ ation that the president may have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to check the evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called anchor p@@ eg@@ s .
they are mostly switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations were issued that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his former election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation .
on Thursday evening , legal experts said on US television that the obj@@ ection would show that Mu@@ eller would not be intim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the charging of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the setting up of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump is to be set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House respects all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ro@@ oting accus@@ ations , accus@@ ations against dr@@ unk@@ ards have become loud , they have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure for the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and his staff .
this triggered spec@@ ulation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later res@@ ig@@ ned president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented Bill of Law on Thursday , after which the special issu@@ er could not be dismissed as easily as possible .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has become detached from the ice shelf just seven times the size of Berlin .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which weighs heavily over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square @-@ kilomet@@ re , now drives to the north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for human beings .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now abor@@ ted col@@ os@@ sus was so far part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf .
ice cream flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking was disturbed several years ago .
a complete cow@@ ardi@@ ce is torn down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is in danger , as the front edge never pulled back as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can break down if a piece break@@ age at one key .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glacier flows directly into the sea and can flow faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to monitor Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the record began , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly gather together , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not trace the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ chi@@ cks of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic ice surface has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decrease in temperature has contributed to the decrease in temperature .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been heated by around three degrees in the last 50 years and so it counts to the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants house tari@@ ff at the personnel
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls for the employer &apos;s association to step out to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the circle @-@ day has set 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have finished their first working day .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were reported for the places that were to be procu@@ red this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , the search for doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs for skilled workers but to counter@@ act forward @-@ looking applications .
the overall concept should be oriented in@@ wards and out@@ war@@ dly , show concrete measures for newcom@@ ers and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is accompanied by a high number of employees who termin@@ ate the service illness or age @-@ related reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high time for action so that there are no more places left un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the common application with his party .
he recently caused a la@@ ze @-@ thick surprise in the circle of circles when he questioned the st@@ aff@@ ing of personnel and st@@ un@@ ned the remaining parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a discharge from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county council with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U is thus trying to pay better to employees and officials when it comes to the public service tari@@ ff .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards working years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Reser@@ vation Act .
last but not least , the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy acc@@ entu@@ ates the tone on NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
Italy has warned that NGOs operating lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not be allowed to continue doing so if they do not abide by new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Minister Marco Minn@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ ained &apos; because their team worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself on detailed alleg@@ ations of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio , an Italian prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had monitored the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ ained &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that his crew takes ship din@@ gh@@ y migrants , who are delivered directly to them by traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all , must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , Minn@@ i said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the b@@ ail@@ out measures had fallen dramatically in recent weeks , which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
suits and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were always long climb@@ s , for the long tri@@ ms rewarded .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ ms and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two days a lot of altitude metres have been announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and h@@ uts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing Sole in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally - .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of vent@@ uring through the stadium in wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels inclusive .
these have also recognised the first Federal li@@ ga@@ des who are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport division in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that many clubs rise up this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Association organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt &apos;s potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than only once a year send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the soccer @-@ simulation FIFA are fought on a level of competition .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since become established in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and for the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it really a sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which are also found in the classic sport - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ ender player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to carry through online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientists highlight the high integr@@ ative impact of e @-@ sport .
the players are on the road all over the world , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ sport .
as a result , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany in 2016 , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
this is little against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot to do in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and France , the football league football clubs according to D@@ utt have in the meantime been obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nostal@@ gia to decay and to extingu@@ ish the old times is not enough today .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot hold on to the fact that everything remains as it always was with football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years of imprisonment .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June of Con@@ rad Roy &apos;s negli@@ gent murder , taking life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ sol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she was faced with a 20 @-@ year sentence , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards looking eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer stated that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day when I do not regret the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain , which we will bear for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person I &apos;ve been with since my birth each day is a pain that I will always remember for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news , which she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coinci@@ dence .
FC Bayern will win a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation will not be har@@ med .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that was Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made himself tied to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first mission as a Bavarian Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could also suggest Kim@@ i .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f , born out of youth players , de@@ but@@ s and just out of vacation .
you prefer to distribute sugar@@ s to those who want to be in a good mood .
so those who were chosen to take the inheritance of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old ti@@ pped over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
to the right back , that is his position , the white ties on the arm did their rest .
and at all Kim@@ i was in this starting formation like the one who can take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ tuned army .
he had a look at the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( folded hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on de@@ vil@@ s come out to join the performances of the Asia @-@ journey ( fold also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le avoid falling neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked very well .
next to Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy was running away from the def@@ ences , both acted as confident .
the well @-@ named Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the build @-@ up .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we &apos;d hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also caught up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usually this Bayern world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw following the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting phrase from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the newcom@@ er any more .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates O@@ FB ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our O@@ FB ladies
Austria &apos;s well @-@ known foot b@@ aller has been informed about Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ S@@ FB ladies wish all the best .
the Bayern @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire is a club colleague of Ö@@ FS @-@ capit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ a@@ der@@ beck and fe@@ ver@@ ish with our La@@ dies .
the tweet of the Austrian foot@@ b@@ aller of the Year and Champions League winners should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .
the famous Bayern @-@ Dus@@ el might also need our ladies .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V inquiry of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing addresses the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning set @-@ up procedure , until 2021 is supposed to be the building law .
West@@ um@@ pf@@ ung Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the federal motorway schedule .
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Ministry spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier stri@@ ves , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , to the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that has been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , praise the I@@ HK .
the Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees in the new champion bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates in ten years after the master training turn themselves on their own .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , facts can be created quickly , at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Trier .
until now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire sent@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U leader , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points out calculations made by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept of how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the network supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
former Minister for Economic Affairs , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she cleared the field due to in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a back@@ lash
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based - prohi@@ bit or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des which em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rej@@ ecting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s faults , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted in the United States , others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be heavily over@@ loaded by Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar visitors also participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you go back to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building reference wants to clear up .
you can see a big info about the raft on the raft .
it shows a Müll@@ berg .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protective field of wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ern@@ wort and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on sket@@ ches , the no@@ d@@ bits of his characters are his trademarks .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he proposed himself as an artist for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man and works almost ten hours a day .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his figures continues to spread throughout the world .
he has also been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series for six years with his figures .
the main person in Cra@@ zy Island &apos;s film is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los of any animal in his drawings - which has a thousand @-@ feet as an opponent .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which will come to the screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced without words .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threat@@ ens climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of the illnesses that transmit insects , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert at the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has an effect on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacteria that transm@@ its d@@ war@@ ves , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ ing of the evap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the little town Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 year anniversary this year .
Festival highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medi@@ eval Fe@@ ast .
Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ab@@ onds or a land refugee camp will have to experience these days in the city centre .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organized crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug warfare .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings reach .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ed up throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ anian .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders connected with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and although the terrain is still more tra@@ it@@ or .
without information about the kill@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ stru@@ st@@ are all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly around in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing to say about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug que@@ ens that are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ ien Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were accepting that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars equity hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ation problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to post harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez gained the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that you are assigned to as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ workers , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Carmen , the bar opposite the office , always sitting at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that Spyware was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce offices in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters wonder@@ ed whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself referred to as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are actually under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce focused on three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exit to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group staying in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , which led to kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the entire century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man kidn@@ apped a military raid .
only a few months earlier , readers considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for notes and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez took a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say it &apos;s based on DNA testing that it &apos;s his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der in writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings in organized protests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is going away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they said the truth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then she has requested that she be re@@ group@@ ed by the government because she is concerned that her anger viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ competent society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book called &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces , who put together the organised crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media fan group assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the C@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue what El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who in 2015 was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who go back and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , admitted that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they have released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens were nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the unbelievable N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain farmer were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they even realized that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of an &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ ans living in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition ab@@ ba@@ ff@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil species .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
over the next six years , they spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only blin@@ dly glimpse a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it had slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go down into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by din@@ osau@@ rs eating meat .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors and used a shield technique that is known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ed@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ad@@ owing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ad@@ owing is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the v@@ eiling of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than boot@@ y , indicating that these no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs were exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on indications of his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as Southern Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved shed skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only match a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the Earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that after death Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank into the sea and m@@ um@@ med in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were resting on his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin cr@@ ust still cover b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such level of conservation is as rare as winning the lot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , and his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales at its sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ ass on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ bol@@ ge .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ re @-@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people have been injured in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ ge on Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , nearly 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , crashed into one another .
at first there are no information about the exact number of injured parties .
a police spokes@@ man said it was mild to moderate injuries .
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in Munich &apos;s direction of travel , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long way back was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , it also happened on the counter @-@ road to massive disability - due to numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was the hall@@ mark of the vehicle operators who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident scene .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : there &apos;s nothing wrong sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes a smoothly or t@@ ear@@ ns the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the perfect ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is the name of the train without a conductor .
to be able to use this , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you must have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to purchase it via the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .
and finally , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you enter the train , call your ticket unter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant is at number Y at the ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
one can therefore continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant will simply check in the DB Navigator itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often go by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest off@@ ences .
because often one has , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to assign is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the conductor over time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
further train numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to her core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment they rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly reli@@ eved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper of the area of St. Louis was killed live on twe@@ ets by Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put off her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photographs of the police band and people crying , and by a man claiming to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed when a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman sh@@ ook his gun and shou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... Anim@@ als all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ m@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cin@@ emas from 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists of people &apos;s point of view , who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two spoke a conversation that they had &quot; black experience and black condition &quot; countless times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ m@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be a bad service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ m@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came into mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt In@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel the project closer together with six other natives , followed by the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are portra@@ yed , for so I will be portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that in this work and in the fabri@@ cation of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement who have influenced the movie &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ m@@ ack@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is uph@@ eld by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at which Fer@@ rel was chosen as the heart of the film based on their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook off this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these junc@@ tions as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long ago , but the ra@@ cial links between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ m@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway during a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels oblig@@ ated to this memory , since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the issue hardly leaves the subject cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
with the beginning of construction work will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - at Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years we have been buying in the farmers market hall almost every week .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ ch@@ ery for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery will arrive at the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping bags in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I don &apos;t find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of that in our city .
you can see how many shops are vac@@ ant here - some for months and years .
but as there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is largely offered directly by the producer and is reasonably priced .
as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special shops don &apos;t exist any more and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall go down during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit @-@ gallery actually comes at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gallery already do it before , to distribute all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but there is no room for a farmer &apos;s market hall thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
once the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen p@@ ans and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 year sentence after she publicly disclosed diplomatic noti@@ fications about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and dissi@@ p@@ ating dissi@@ dent whose conviction was turned by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created a shar@@ per through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by man@@ ing and from the 30 portraits , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual comment , not only to the extent of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already spoke openly about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not attend this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use were turned into un@@ equal letters , which , over the course of two years , exchanged several letters .
they even created a com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ali Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would convert Chel@@ seas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coinci@@ dence .
there are also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further fl@@ are the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing concluded with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
de@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des following the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how surprisingly similar , at least in biological sense , we are all .
&quot; hopefully , what people will hopefully bring along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the com@@ ic @-@ nov@@ ella mentioned above .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in his hand from the disciplinary bar@@ racks of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they kiss your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sends greetings from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations that gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed by Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University for Kil@@ l
a country @-@ wide human hunt is under way for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an Oxford employee , looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died 26 , after several en@@ grav@@ ings .
a public warning system published by the Chicago police agency states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the action , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them has now been in review and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker from the University and Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investig@@ ators in every possible way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA driving plan in the near future &quot; - Mut@@ ko , vice @-@ president of Russia
Russian vice @-@ president Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA driving plan was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA driving plan to comply with the code describing the criteria for re@@ insertion of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren into alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has gotten a fault . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ kos s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in conversation with the Russian sales point of r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one intends to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
these were shared by the company groups .
it was a pure precau@@ tion , it could be further assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it was said in the announcement .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ legitimate anti @-@ lice attack .
Al@@ di wanted to establish clarity and transparency with his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company do not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has sum@@ mon@@ ed people from the outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , to offer special groups and demographic groups , to provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow administrators to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
ret@@ t said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the snap poll@@ s and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low tuning results - so that you can rep@@ lic@@ it why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 according to the financially innovative Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the middle of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ everything in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
the customer has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send customized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that enables employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion has covered the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good way to track complaints from employees .
now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that gives the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of firms like S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and managed to finance its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more of their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Link@@ ed@@ In who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
data on employee engagement according to workplace culture experts is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff according to your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and dis@@ cour@@ aged employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so ret@@ ched .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
in the case of Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to better binding of employees in a branch that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it goes on at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the team &apos;s new practice fields on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes constitute a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and they actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six play@@ times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the start of formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them for three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they still plac@@ id themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practice as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a up@@ scale hotel that has already been pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed with foot@@ balls , which is a protective net behind a gate post , will not be an easy task .
brood @-@ Player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fac@@ tual review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and show their results in the original article , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ t@@ test@@ ers , which may display results of the fact examination from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main award points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in English that a test of the new facts test will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to recogni@@ zing the stories of third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : in 2014 he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is there himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome message &quot; ) , this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape gardening , gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats told &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who owned something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of a rebellion which occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they are connected with each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ er , whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is represented in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug up ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed quite cow@@ ard@@ ly , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crises , mar@@ rying rich old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to attract land@@ lords . &quot;
after the end of his essay in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August , it is supposed to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes on her webpage shared yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ f citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , it &apos;s about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s called on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally she stands in competition with other communities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f can afford a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building , as in the past , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
the discussions took place under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government , including the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the head@@ count .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been aboli@@ shed .
ever since the coup of the coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 Gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who were to have participated directly in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean up the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet , &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ e@@ as@@ iness in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ count ban for soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , large @-@ scale pur@@ ges in the army and security forces continue .
in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan allowed more 7@@ 3@@ 95 soldiers to fire per decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the actual masters of the country .
three times they were put@@ ted by calling on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan returns to the military &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the reform specifications of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan has pur@@ pos@@ efully advanced an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a named officer , who was seeking asylum from persecution abroad after the coup attempt , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot;
if that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
anyway , in the Alliance after the cleansing , there is no doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English which have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to re@@ charge circuit for race ticket shuttle
over the past few months , over the past few months , the future of the race @-@ gate sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it should go very fast .
before the end of the year it is planned to build on the ailing track that runs through the tourist train .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the route is to begin this year in order to secure the future of the road gate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order and san@@ i@@ tise the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is comm@@ enting itself to this especially important link for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Minister @-@ Secretary Klaus Techn@@ olog@@ ue on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country is 75 percent .
the contract , on which the Shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared expi@@ ation .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia Railway as an operator have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; concluded at@@ oning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race route shuttle should be ordered regul@@ arily in December 2017 .
the &quot; Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle &quot; is an especially popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route of sufficient number of people will be used to order it again in the future .
the track is also partly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the ascension of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye color to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it will be even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford wife look progressive .
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed characters such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ ox@@ y Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has its mo@@ ods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spirits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , is disturbing the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xes with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ xx@@ ox@@ y ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point towards something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men , of course , will not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R list@@ ens to their rising popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not odd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the lowed body and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
does Tr@@ um@@ ps have great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ certainty of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day , there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all committed to bur@@ sting our filtering bubbles .
less noted is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist po@@ et@@ ess who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and completely peculi@@ arly on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is noticeable in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the horri@@ fying effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and dr@@ unk@@ enness , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ elled .
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself today affected by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both seem to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence compared to Tr@@ ump .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be spiritually healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city when no caffeine is needed .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are qu@@ aint and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the music @-@ per@@ mitting music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience since two two @-@ year @-@ olds , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &quot; s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was dis@@ ap@@ pointing , while I tired the experience to reach my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a visit to the hospital .
last year , he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
due to murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cab in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he was holding his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , of which they say that they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarter grin@@ ders from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holiday and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for school discharge , the 29 pupils of the four classes elected a young eagle , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lively band performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken from it sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain .
then the classes showed three and four in the rehear@@ sal of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les who bore the cylinders to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a hen .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ four@@ fold chan@@ ger that he felt accepted in his new school .
there followed thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always jumps with classes of classes , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the ch@@ ick time is over , explained school teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she was only very reluc@@ tant to leave her students , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ se@@ ater .
at the end , all students left a song of sum@@ mer@@ time and holiday time .
there was great joy with the children .
eight first @-@ time suppliers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of 1 August a group of illeg@@ ally camp people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while at the moment an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates before are only valid for vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ e@@ an@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ arm@@ ament has been ordered by the Federal Rail@@ ways Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler reported to write to everyone concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be carried out within the framework .
how long should the retro@@ fitting take place overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what are drivers that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would prefer S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
in rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel engines so far .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the prize winners does not want to come - in protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the prestigious awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
like the cultural institution on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ our@@ able .
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and take part in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore announced to abst@@ ain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even withdraw funds - and that is bur@@ dening me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will take advantage of the discussion with Tr@@ ump in order to make clear her view .
the Kennedy @-@ Centre , named after the former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the earlier winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written - however , suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been Stadt@@ bau@@ meister for the past 31 years .
and the work still gives him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press talk .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has been fulfilled so far .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time to famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with it .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub@@ contractor , the applicant has to provide corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they were no longer able to fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but clos@@ eness to citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate as well as a good mood among the authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ hof farm ground are about to be initiated .
the kin@@ zig@@ brücke bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium refur@@ bish@@ ment is still a topic .
the latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a city builder there is a lot of room for design .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and nur@@ sery you can react quite flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands under monumental protection as an ensemble , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is fitting &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city builder emphasizes .
anyway , the city building master bears great responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of staff for supervision and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even though his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further shaping of the city .
according to the city of Has@@ lach , who would like to bury Roland W@@ acker should be able to present a completed degree course as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building and planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are under construction and civil engineering , construction gui@@ deline , under@@ mining facilities , administration of urban properties , urban facilities with a building yard and urban gar@@ dener , as well as Lower Building Law Off@@ ices , including monument protection .
bike thrown on cables : Süd@@ bahn clamp locked
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the railway tracks in the area of Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and are looking for them since the night hours .
a ros@@ ary roller driver and a bicycle driver had been observed near the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ an Empire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves into great danger and also endangered trains .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay time and the costs for the rail freight transport , pat@@ rons of the railway clients could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the Southern Railway Line could be run without disabilities .
nearly ten passenger trains had fallen on Friday morning , two of which were connected to the remote traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant col@@ on .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are capable of induc@@ ing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments we found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han supports toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el movements if the same system also works with people .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but which was separately accommod@@ ated , had not .
they presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial phenomenon of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found which were present in mice with the immune cells , but were lacking in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand the effects of the bacteria on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s food , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us can protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Manchester United , having signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ pro@@ visi@@ oning Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commitments , but insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the club for that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the radar screen was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only a bla@@ zing fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ winds from the Con@@ federation - was thus the most important desire of the elec@@ tive warri@@ ors .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus is watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Mr Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with the head@@ wind .
there were deep set@@ backs .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprise fraction of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition lost its single @-@ vote majority to the opposition of CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party executive Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the stub@@ born Low @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accession to the CD@@ U means a clear adul@@ ter@@ ation of the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Minister and El@@ ection Director of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says an electoral champion of the SPD , when on Friday morning the new ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , former SPD Chancellor of Lower Saxony , joins the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the accession of the Green Democ@@ rat MEPs El@@ ke T@@ westen there .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD &apos;s state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ chief began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more did not so@@ o@@ the the comrades at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel led the SPD to w@@ ander , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
the comrades had lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ped back in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next blow .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD deputy commander , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communications he did so pretty much everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz struggles for his political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW emissions standards and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the critic@@ isms for quite some time now .
the results of this survey were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps because of this , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the League over the past weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain concealed in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of parti@@ san co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz does not at all .
at times comrades , therefore , try to keep their ranks closed .
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the stub@@ born Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ life@@ jackets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen makes her own career choices about the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of party lef@@ ti@@ sts in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ rash has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but has been elected to parliament via the country list of the Lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Sax@@ on SPD as a leading candidate in the election of the German Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or further commitments made by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for centre III
those who want to san@@ i@@ ti@@ ze their home in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives spoke urban development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there are renovation areas in sensitive areas .
at that time , in the I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the II period from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - it is finally important to foster the development of the interior , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a restructuring area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest of the community felt sensitive .
how does a san@@ itation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , according to Sch@@ in@@ dler , investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area there is any interest whatsoever to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the area borders could be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund @-@ Länder @-@ Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the programme are the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out in an object @-@ related manner , i.e. per property .
the refur@@ bish@@ ment area would then finally be defined as statute .
since 1 January 2017 , the authorisation period for the funding is ongoing until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , the survey would only be carried out , as part of those participating in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the purpose of the sentence is to take place as far as possible , so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every commun@@ e must carry out the forec@@ asted pre @-@ examinations .
it is a question of ass@@ essing urban development and deciding when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there is also a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann would even come back to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed that the project was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which includes , among other things , the structural condition and the restructuring measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing Chamber &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business arch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out when premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphasized that the distribution of the subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
you can &apos;t reserve subsidies for later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local centre II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown , in order to make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to those present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or adop@@ ts himself a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisor An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the wh@@ ats of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military that has been left to TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited in addition to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fork @-@ lift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Bureau called for the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the H@@ MX @-@ 1 commander on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy commander of the aviation .
the news showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so it remained until the law@@ ns were cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours .
the original air@@ crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt destiny .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform , which was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but to demand their use only for a photo op is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation when the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane ahead of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services rendered , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane by its predec@@ essors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thri@@ lled with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the assistant secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to dep@@ ose the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 practice landing in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a Si@@ kor@@ sky spokes@@ man said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24,@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for ref@@ unds is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are contained in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of contract .
at that time , the former White House press spokes@@ man , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

despite the five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has maintained the sense of reality .
in any case , Team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; right at the rear positions I find the crew very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V mainly imports from the high north provide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their roofs and Finn@@ s can even point to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ gh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good deal of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man currently still active in the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent in Bi@@ ella &apos;s Italian Bi@@ ella is not part of the Bundes@@ liga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the competition in the Czech Liber@@ ec , will be his first bet in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated guitarist Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was supposed to be at the same time as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ cir@@ z could again move back to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , someone fills the cad@@ re from the trainer around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law bann@@ ing sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to issue the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress put in a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors in the local O@@ MV are concerned , which co @-@ funded the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea division North Stream 2 together with other European companies .
the dr@@ ones are huge .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump itself would have to raise the sanctions by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the Group could withstand and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the center of the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ co , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bra killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest ar@@ cs of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more governmental bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the newly published Tra@@ iler , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the type that invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ lam and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ co will begin on September 1st .
roll back : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban nur@@ series , the watch is turned back .
on 1 September Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban nur@@ series ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh g@@ ek@@ o@@ ks ch@@ illed .
the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a warm meal at noon .
last year there were 28@@ 00 children sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 days of the week , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service from September 1 : they warm up the supplied food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give away the food , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as sev@@ ent@@ een units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why it is all about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the ita spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has shown itself in the price comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign awar@@ ding for the city as the most economical one , it is stated from the Press Office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours do not fall so strongly at about 750 people in education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting chief of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates in the Council elections in the provinces . three women nom@@ inate for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s role cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting actions to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will further reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

men attempt to ro@@ b 13 years old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police information , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to telephone with the girl &apos;s mobile phone .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in the case of managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ i said he has invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; first learn &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voice concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members deeply .
generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and chronic conditions of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed by a flour@@ ishing production presence in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ di said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it , as we value the continuous commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; over the past few years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and entirely . if our operational processes change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga might regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having left an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the record of the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning for 89 million pounds in the past season to Manchester United .
after its completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a spring near the Catalan pres@@ idency is insist@@ ing that the club always has its best to take care of it since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City held an interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strong warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Association keen to express interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter is turned and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator deliberately threw a sco@@ oter in the royal fields street in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused damage of over 200 Euro in the disgu@@ ise of the vehicle .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , tel . 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for hints .
for an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , police are looking for witnesses .
because a car met him on his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guard rail .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um arrived with his VW at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area around Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on his lane so he had to reti@@ re to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail .
material damage was created on the passenger car .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the car driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident .
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter vehicle to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s Brother George R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , Spo@@ k@@ es@@ man of the Reform Movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication opposite the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister George R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret through their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false estim@@ ation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican City newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that when reporting about violence in the cathedral spar@@ rows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were measured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but con@@ spic@@ uous is the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the daily experience and is preparing the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ ah . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and it &apos;s a dev@@ out fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stripes were a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for the past decades , for the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) , is totally wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is the 440 page report submitted by Ulrich Weber to the En@@ ligh@@ tenment by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regensburg dome @-@ spar@@ rows were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by R. Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could also be more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him , despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen George R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence in protection of protection at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students stand out for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ oline cler@@ k and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who has become more pal@@ p@@ able when a cathedral spar@@ row has no top performance musi@@ cally .
how can you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
there are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or sympathy in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside of his sphere of influence .
one can reproach him at best , learn from it too late or have taken the first hints at least seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he was working was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also portra@@ ys him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by children &apos;s grapes . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks .
the fact that he not only kn@@ itted with chairs and threw the key ring on the floor , but also distributed ear cow@@ ard@@ ly and che@@ ek@@ y boys to the hair or ears , he even admitted to years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fra@@ y times , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers .
do you still know such cultivation methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced it in a secular school , a state grammar school .
compared to what is actually in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the excessive consumption of violence in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders if it is not with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just fallen on him .
many who have never understood him are still eag@@ erly working on the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report a lot has been reported about abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be subjected to any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real issue in the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then surely not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators in a professional manner .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... in no case where he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the offen@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I consider it ... also for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ ys have opened intru@@ sive or more clearly or rather than opposite their parents , boarding managers , trust teachers , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talking to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of every sympathy .
so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as happened in some cases unfortunately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big issue that everything was mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge gang of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses , as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a ch@@ oral leader of the cathedral spar@@ rows .
the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were seriously har@@ assed and painted , all of them took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled out .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister George R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he only got the boys face when they were already on the cathedral square gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses emphasize , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you were only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; states .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic authority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at the most is the reproach that they have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the proceedings at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only about 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger strictly shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral square gymn@@ asi@@ um , which even re@@ produces the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool the punishment would continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended an urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as as@@ ce@@ as@@ ers were forbidden in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us knows yet .
it was difficult for him to estimate , where the persons affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ sed , and where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that it would always have looked away .
this simply is not true .
only in 1980 examinations were officially aboli@@ shed in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis maintained that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the danger of evaluating the past by today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess already was right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was horri@@ ble at all times and also not for what was bre@@ ached in the pres@@ ch@@ ool against ad@@ versity and violence against innocent child souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
that &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time I must protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ ne@@ stly and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was banned , he kept himself strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has shown Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject &quot; Prü@@ fer @-@ punishment &quot; also a language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI said from his perspective , that the dome @-@ cats only played a side @-@ role .
nevertheless , I do not at all conc@@ ede that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boy makes no great singer and success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced over and over again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do just a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ oration , regularly get in touch with him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but it was also a respect@@ ful respect to which they are still gaz@@ ing up and who are down@@ right ad@@ mitting them .
and please , once more clearly : everything you submit to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time for a long time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
the evil intent behind it is all too obvious .
for the report that has just been published is reli@@ eving him .
now the status would be , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace .
