<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel that is now digging for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the erstwhile reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official card promotes exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows this, who had to get upset already, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the Digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer by the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when compared to current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flicketing carpet, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, detailed maps, so-called primary position sheets, were worked into for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian survey management between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - naturally for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were finally departing with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max. Joseph further pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau," and thus the Bavarian surveying management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The primeval sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found like all the others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling became 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser until 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered plots from the so-called" "" "primitive" "" "from which the basic tax was derived." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots of land do not occupy any farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in the Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the primeval sheet, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen one reads not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the height "On the ventilation" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one used to lock people with lunatics.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59, the Munich-based district-asylum-asylum" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive in his time and, for example, ended the betting of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel to employ violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who was engaged in an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients it was initially allocated space, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotor renaissance institute in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar Amper Hospital Munich-Ost in 2006, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum encounter each other on the premises of the former Auer institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, East residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in architectural allusion to the original building of the Irrenaissance institution, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-up will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes Travel alert for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for the Promotion of Colours has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in recent times across the state and can be noted here," stated in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination suits, as well as the state prosecuting authorities, who disproportionately aim at minorities, caused the group to issue the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted events such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the trip through the state and was put into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Bureau of the General Attorney General of Missouri, where it is shown that black motorists in the state are being halted 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing if they bring Caution money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting program of the FBI, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also a response to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profile.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen's Weidezvn Project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fishermen's CDU regional association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Pivemetry Court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his operation, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many kittens and houses five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "is the alternative for him for the milk of his cows," "" "says Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengeeste, only regionals arrive.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also the chairman of the BLHV fisherman's bach, he called the" "" "elementary importance" "" "the" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I can't manage to work profitably on such steep surfaces." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area for a lot of work, much has to be processed with the sense of brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and the topography here," "" "emphasized Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad of the leaders" "" "promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operations," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of preservation is 40 hectares, which cannot be forested at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">The farmers therefore remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of soft-fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß asserted that" "" "the best foods are produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape care line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state support of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor belt recorded by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be fenced may not be more ppery (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishermen's Weidezvous project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of ownership corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is accepting the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue by himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty isitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller asked Acosta, "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly speaking right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporaneous response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, the miserable decay of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable garbage" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early neoconservatives, who brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch will not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual, Limbaugh has encountered something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch will not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black announces Scottish members of the Great Britain Team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew ButRecorder - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her talk was incredible," "" "Black said." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete with the 400 m hurdles in her fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-range runner Muir leads along this path and last year has set five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that you should watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the team captain says that they are" "" "hugely proud" "" "to the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in medals and finals." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and elected me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It just shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">Concerning my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are in the Olympiastadion again.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the burning of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He slipped in the criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union pleaded him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it is only Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval by the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in directing his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to depress his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of people coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just genuine people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not crowded, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also don't appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some more than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It shouldn't be that hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portable had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied in between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters came to his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters of newspapers that settled Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his position, according to historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed they were late to discover that they had mistakenly flown with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people, carried out by a Jet Charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers were more likely to disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Among those surveyed admitted that they unknowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of the millennials were compared with less than 15 percent, the members of the generation X were.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 per cent admitted to have knowingly borne containers by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it surveyed travellers all over the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled ware by airport security and how many things they had intentionally done.</seg>

<seg id="421">"" "electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to deal with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla" "" "Model 3" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="422">At the same time, he has underestimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk will reveal a different, less brilliant figure for the first time on the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">During the past few months, Musk had become more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk has dreamed: of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 had already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment 45,000 such non-binding reservations have been made, Musk cleaned up in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="432">By 2018, all models will be taken together - 500,000 in 2020, one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1800 bookings available per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who orders a "Model 3" today may expect delivery early in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new, never-tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization in practice.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPO leader Pruitt retreats because of the withdrawal of the rules of the Obama-Era to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">A day after he was accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a deadline for States on October 1 to comply with the standards of Ozone in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance for one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of rigorous environmental protection regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to blocking or delaying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prudential regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to co-operate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPO often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">"" "however, the opinion of the EPO stated that Pruitt will eventually exploit his" "" "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" "" "to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive reversion of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A draft approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who filed the EPA this week, said the group wanted to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"" "" "" "the reverse of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," "" "said Schneiderman."

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingens to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Register: count Hermann von Sulz sold the hill with the parish church on Tumlingen / Germany and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumour Hill, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court that belonged to the church or the patron saint, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As described in the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, the "mountain" was the third, the village centre of the village, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village of Tumlingen.</seg>
<seg id="475">Ancient maps from around the year 1600 reinforce these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage emerged from the early medieval self-Church right.</seg>
<seg id="477">The owner of this church remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Connected with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The elder of the two collapsed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church mill and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The ruins of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the steeple and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenbach and Rolf-Dieter Wasmer maintain the Hilarius system as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tumlingens on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery of the St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by Combo des Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann is talking about the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">At the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," "" "the organizers provide fantastic views." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade is held only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is important for tumors and hearing aids.</seg>
<seg id="503">Friends and supporters of Tumlingens are particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim wears" "" "has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In principle, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones are meant to prevent" "" "asparagus" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government in Düsseldorf had not authorized the city of Viersen because of a malfunction.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval certificate is still illegal and therefore also rejected," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" "" "Boisheim weaves" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="517">It takes them as an occasion to re-examine the matter.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"" "with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the" "" "Boisheim wears" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW AG, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim niche.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be covered, which corresponds to approximately one-fifth of the electricity demand of all four-channel households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re-intends to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, the City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach reached a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge on Wednesday morning on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fastener, which is also used as an operating way.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20-metre-wide bridge crane is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian path is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridges.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special feeling of intuition has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed in advance of the work by handsets about the project.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Financial Regulations of Football on Neymars Move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues from European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG must eventually prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money in order for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the host family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to use legitimate sources of income that allow them to break the break even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to club debts to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three years FFP default period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favor of the presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare away from excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely increase the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue for the next five years will be in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of EU penalties in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catarist company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship's value was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of PSG payments to Neymar could be due to payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar World Cup ambassadors are going to become such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more aware of every attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the conditions of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year Grunge era (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humors (it contained an original story for a duly jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>

<seg id="1190">"" "at one point, one character sticks through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" "" "a number of other things from 1991." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, still has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another mad-evil plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good visual impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's underlip of "Singles" whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental madness that could fuel this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"" "" "" "Comrade Detective" "" "on Amazon is reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by" "" "The Americans" "", "the film" "" "Atomic Blonde" "" "and even" "" "GLOW" "" "with its East-against-West wrestling iconography." ""</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic iosef - are being played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues will be dubbed by Channing Gestum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching TV watching how Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it runs away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," who was edited on a lower length, could better supply his agitprop satire since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a forage for a money.</seg>

<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor told Konstanz on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">At the same time, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued warrants of arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials treated larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">With the same raids in Italy, two persons were arrested.</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of a strengthening pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The political decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members pursuing a rise this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on domestic revenues would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But she signaled that in the next few years rate increases would be needed to curb the inflation of the Brexit and she said that the costs of credit might have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets.</seg>

<seg id="1269">It will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that now it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - with £115 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1270">After deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said: "in the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."</seg>

<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is likely to recover slightly after the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1283">The decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the fall of the pound.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers in July demanding an increase to 0.5%.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in the NHS after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that pre-sexual preventive prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>

<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."</seg>

<seg id="1296">Preposition prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV agents taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission at risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In hospitals, suitable candidates are identified which agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS UK signed a contract for delivery of medications this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Big Life: mezzanine and clever designer-tricks have turned this Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former owner of real estate, shrunk from a big Knightsbridge house to Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold her.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet have been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous slab height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed von Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF panel." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important that when you push the door, it is very easy to glide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a vestigial form, a real estate agent will enter and execute a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square metervalue of some standard in something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a USD 500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in an argument because of one of Victorias's largest real estate empire worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business capacity should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">The West co-jeans family grew up there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father Colin - by Paul as the "master operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A legal file says that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has been a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the units proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affirmdavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul says, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeans-load of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started with Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to trial," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly really can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior employees on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House that he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television ranges back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were convincing," "" "said former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February over Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habitual under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials don't know what we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump hasn't sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers manage to keep annoyance from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented any contentious controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "" "" "Politico - dealing with this story - reported in May about the advisers" "" "preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that drunkers like a volcano can react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he is eager to find out where these come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet vocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for chicane, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoiced it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "attempted to implement a system for managing and documenting the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then ambience operating company ltd. until 13 April 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the county.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again into a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt-object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are welcome Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1486">The investigation focuses on several men who acted in the election campaign as consultants of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller took a close look at more and more drumps in private and business environments.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special issuer Trump came to the centre personally and examined the accusation that the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Lawys is to check the evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called anchor pegs.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are mostly switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations were issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>

<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. were also Trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former election chief Paul Manafort during the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">On Thursday evening, legal experts said on US television that the objection would show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller would be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">There have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now aborted colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice cream floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete cowardice is torn down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say about the fact that the Larsen-C ice shelf is in danger, as the front edge never pulled back as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can break down if a piece breakage at one key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glacier flows directly into the sea and can flow faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to monitor Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest retreat since the record began," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists have disputed whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly gather together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not trace the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-chicks of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic ice surface has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decrease in temperature has contributed to the decrease in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been heated by around three degrees in the last 50 years and so it counts to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants house tariff at the personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls for the employer's association to step out to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the circle-day has set 41 new places in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have finished their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were reported for the places that were to be procured this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 unoccupied places in the circle of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, the search for doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to meet not only short-term needs for skilled workers but to counteract forward-looking applications.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwardly, show concrete measures for newcomers and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is from a" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This is accompanied by a high number of employees who terminate the service illness or age-related reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1569">"" "" "" "high time for action so that there are no more places left unoccupied." ""</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He recently caused a laze-thick surprise in the circle of circles when he questioned the staffing of personnel and stunned the remaining parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a discharge from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county council with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a house tariff," "" "said people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">The CDU is thus trying to pay better to employees and officials when it comes to the public service tariff.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards working years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Reservation Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least, the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy accentuates the tone on NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned that NGOs operating lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not be allowed to continue doing so if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work," "" "said Minister of Minister Marco Minni in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Retained' because their team worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself on detailed allegations of Ambrogio Cartosio, an Italian prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in an opinion on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had monitored the boat from 'Youth Retained', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that his crew takes ship dinghy migrants, who are delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa, above all, must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "to their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize laureate organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "meanwhile, Minni said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the bailout measures had fallen dramatically in recent weeks, which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trials and sights.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for touring.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always long climbs, for the long trims rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of venturing through the stadium in wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels inclusive.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognised the first Federal ligades who are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1623">"real football must deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than only once a year send the federal government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In E-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the soccer-simulation FIFA are fought on a level of competition.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since become established in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And for the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which are also found in the classic sport - for example increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fender player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but Frobing also sees problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">As a result, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany in 2016, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"" "however," "" "e-sport" "" "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," "" "writes the Deloitte advisors." ""</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW president said the company believes that "there are smarter options as driving restrictions," and referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based - prohibit or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides which emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralisation of exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rejecting the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid Volkswagen's faults, which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back under normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>

<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "he said once." ""</seg>

<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatens climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the illnesses that transmit insects, which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an effect on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a microbacteria that transmits dwarves, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowing of the evaporation of the soil, but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug warfare.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings reach.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are piled up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez said in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamanian.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders connected with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and although the terrain is still more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we mistrustare all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to say about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug queens that are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damien Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were accepting that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars equity holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxication problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to post harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria Moors Cabot Award" "" "for her reporting in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez gained the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you must take over the task that you are assigned to as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworkers, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Carmen, the bar opposite the office, always sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "you don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself referred to as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are actually under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce focused on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exit to the state expenditures concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group staying in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, which led to kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the entire century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were charged with high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman kidnapped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers considered Valdez's column as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we knew what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body stature." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for notes and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say it's based on DNA testing that it's his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "in the whole country, journalists have become louder in writing" "" "SOS Press" "" "on walkways and buildings in organized protests." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is going away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">"" "" "" "since then she has requested that she be regrouped by the government because she is concerned that her anger violated her objectivity." ""</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and an incompetent society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book called "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces, who put together the organised crime under a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by dinosaurs eating meat.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shield technique that is known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>

<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the veiling of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the shading - think of roe deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than booty, indicating that these nodosaurs were exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that after death Borealopelta sank into the sea and mummed in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures had an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were resting on his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin crust still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur</seg>

<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen pans and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35 year sentence after she publicly disclosed diplomatic notifications about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and dissipating dissident whose conviction was turned by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharper through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by maning and from the 30 portraits, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment, not only to the extent of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but already spoke openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not attend this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse were turned into unequal letters, which, over the course of two years, exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoali Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelseas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There are also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further flare the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning concluded with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides following the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how surprisingly similar, at least in biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"hopefully, what people will hopefully bring along is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic-novella mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free phone in his hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died 26, after several engravings.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A public warning system published by the Chicago police agency states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the action, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been in review and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "" "said Cubbage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investigators in every possible way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Administration, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"" "" "" "we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2179">Grand Plaza's management team published an explanation to the inhabitants: "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motifs, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will close the WADA driving plan in the near future" - Mutko, vice-president of Russia</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA driving plan was updated in this respect," "" "said Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA driving plan to comply with the code describing the criteria for reinsertion of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has gotten a fault." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">"" "" "" "Mutkos s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales point of rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one intends to accept this report unconditionally," "" "said Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of doping scandals from the WADA.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli announced that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company do not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has summoned people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is at the Wachsen to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, to offer special groups and demographic groups, to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow administrators to bypass the C-Suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Rett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap polls and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low tuning results - so that you can replicit why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won't be the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020 according to the financially innovative Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the middle of Uber-Feverything in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The customer has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"" "as Glint, Convercent companies can send customized" "" "pulse" "" "surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that enables employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion has covered the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumers boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who manages the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that gives the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent received $10 million in financing in February of firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and managed to finance its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more of their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "when people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn who uses both Convercent and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields when their portfolio companies are running well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Data on employee engagement according to workplace culture experts is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff according to your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and discouraged employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow, employees ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about it, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, so retched.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In the case of Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to better binding of employees in a branch that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you also lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It goes on at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA footballers converse on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their jersey and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes constitute a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 o'clock in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted six playtimes in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during the course of August. 20 before the start of formal preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 "s and 1980" s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a coshaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering iewicz, Briy May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only reacted to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700" s who worked for the Jacobins, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself is there himself.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome message"), this seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape gardening, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats told" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who owned something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all the way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording of a rebellion which occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, "Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell is represented in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug up).</seg>
<seg id="2316">"" "the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" "" "the gentlemen seemed quite cowardly, always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford." ""</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building, as in the past, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The discussions took place under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government, including the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus the civilians in YAS were in the headcount.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government attracts the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy have been abolished.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Ever since the coup of the coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 Generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wire-puller of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who were to have participated directly in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet," published an article entitled "Uneasiness in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the abolition of the headcount ban for soldiers, wrote the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, large-scale purges in the army and security forces continue.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In the middle of July, Erdogan allowed more 7395 soldiers to fire per decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The ascension of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will be even more disturbing since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford wife look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed characters such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxoxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible" "", "enthuses the True Companion website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in spirits" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, is disturbing the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxes with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxoxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement point towards something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR listens to their rising popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not odd or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the lowed body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Does Trumps have great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-certainty of the Trump-era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all committed to bursting our filtering bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poetess who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows it, including the republican kinship with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and completely peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is noticeable in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the horrifying effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and drunkenness, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be repelled.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump republicans the right wing, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both seem to be a very mild criminal offence compared to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars to spend in the city when no caffeine is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are quaint and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely gloomy and the music-permitting music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience since two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40 "s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was disappointing, while I tired the experience to reach my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>

<seg id="2452">Due to murder after an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cab in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he was holding his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant colon.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of inducing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments we found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan supports tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movements if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but which was separately accommodated, had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial phenomenon of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found which were present in mice with the immune cells, but were lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand the effects of the bacteria on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us can protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2641">The mischief began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to sanitize their home in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives spoke urban development on Wednesday in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there are renovation areas in sensitive areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the II period from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "achievement project" - it is finally important to foster the development of the interior, and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a restructuring area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euro came from the country, the rest of the community felt sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a sanitation area develop?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "one will, according to Schindler, investigate where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role whether in the planned area there is any interest whatsoever to rehabilitate.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area borders could be postponed again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening, the bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Programme" "" "Social City" "", "where the restructurings would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">Core of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out in an object-related manner, i.e. per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The refurbishment area would then finally be defined as statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">Since 1 January 2017, the authorisation period for the funding is ongoing until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September this year, the survey would only be carried out, as part of those participating in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the purpose of the sentence is to take place as far as possible, so that the restructurings can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every commune must carry out the forecasted pre-examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is a question of assessing urban development and deciding when it will be rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There is also a remark in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann would even come back to sensations and get a picture of the situation she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel stressed that the project was a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"" "the yellow questionnaire is the" "" "building and property sheet" "", "which includes, among other things, the structural condition and the restructuring measures." ""</seg>

<seg id="2701">"" "the blue" "" "business arch" "" "can only be filled out when premises are operated in the building." ""</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">In addition, new construction measures are not eligible for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of the subsidies according to the "greyhound principle" - who comes first, admonishes first.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers according to the military that has been left to TIME magazine up to $24,000.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a Maine Yacht, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fork-lift truck from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Bureau called for the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the HMX-1 commander on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy commander of the aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3 o'clock in the morning, and so it remained until the lawns were cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original aircrew was during the event with the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt destiny.</seg>

<seg id="2730">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not leave Neymar's persecution after having left an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years before the record of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning for 89 million pounds in the past season to Manchester United.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After its completion, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a spring near the Catalan presidency is insisting that the club always has its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City held an interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope's Brother George Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, Spokesman of the Reform Movement "We are Church," declared after publication opposite the German press agency, he received an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret through their own omissions or their then false estimation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican City newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised the fact that when reporting about violence in the cathedral sparrows," "" "two measures" "" "were measured." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts," which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but conspicuous is the "degree of media manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scarafia, Historian and Member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the daily experience and is preparing the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarafah." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and it's a devout fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "stripes were a normal educational tool" "", "" "" "to get done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards for the past decades, for the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, pope-brother George Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages), is totally wrong." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440 page report submitted by Ulrich Weber to the Enlightenment by the Bistum Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburg dome-sparrows were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen, sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by R. Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him, despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen George Ratzinger is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence in protection of protection at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students stand out for" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choline clerk and perfectionist, who has become more palpable when a cathedral sparrow has no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How can you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or sympathy in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses of violence at the pre-school took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can reproach him at best, learn from it too late or have taken the first hints at least seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the gymnasium on which he was working was felt by virtually all respondents as" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also portrays him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by children's grapes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he not only knitted with chairs and threw the key ring on the floor, but also distributed ear cowardly and cheeky boys to the hair or ears, he even admitted to years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fray times, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such cultivation methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced it in a secular school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excessive consumption of violence in the preschool, they are certainly Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still eagerly working on the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report a lot has been reported about abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be subjected to any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "" "said one of the affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real issue in the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then surely not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "concerning sexual abuse... I see... in no case where he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the offenders." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd, to assume that... Buys have opened intrusive or more clearly or rather than opposite their parents, boarding managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "talking to him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of every sympathy.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradictory crimes, as happened in some cases unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "could be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big issue that everything was mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge gang of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses, as well as, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral leader of the cathedral sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were seriously harassed and painted, all of them took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger had nothing to do because he only got the boys face when they were already on the cathedral square gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses emphasize, the subject" "" "Pre-school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">You were only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not a sadistic authority.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at the most is the reproach that they have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the proceedings at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only about 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger strictly shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral square gymnasium, which even reproduces the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this," "" "that in the preschool the punishment would continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as asceasers were forbidden in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows yet.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate, where the persons affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that it would always have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This simply is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 examinations were officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "so the danger of evaluating the past by today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess already was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was horrible at all times and also not for what was breached in the preschool against adversity and violence against innocent child souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all awful and I'm glad that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, thus earnestly and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was banned, he kept himself strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "has shown Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject "Prüfer-punishment" also a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI said from his perspective, that the dome-cats only played a side-role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not at all concede that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, the unruly boy makes no great singer and success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced over and over again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of whom you can't imagine that he could do just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emerioration, regularly get in touch with him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but it was also a respectful respect to which they are still gazing up and who are downright admitting them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: everything you submit to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published is relieving him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the status would be, a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace.</seg>
