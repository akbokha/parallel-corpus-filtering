28 year old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local grocery store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigation was underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job in San Francisco six months ago as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; said the speaker .
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this heavy time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank lived in host@@ els initially , but that &quot; things for him finally went up . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
combining his family with his family was to cook us always something to prepare dinner for us , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of discussion .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , lit up every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the post@@ man letter of the S@@ F@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ gg@@ y to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the latest &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , a TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she brings the question to the white blood : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film will run on our 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Pyr@@ amid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of di@@ version with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted at home in a quick gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and then the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he let himself be led with his family through the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even sw@@ ung for photographic purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen and with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
in the context of a small gala , German sports aid handed over the golden sports pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen .
there is no lack of awards for the lik@@ able ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , champi@@ ons @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already bl@@ amed him .
the 18th award winner of the Sports Pyr@@ amid is long .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the signs are athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Fin@@ ke Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
according to the official part , the illustr@@ ative society moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Award was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - that &apos;s both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two U.S. pres@@ idents are un@@ divided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate it to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he himself , on the other hand , would be completely different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will mas@@ sively return regulations , and he is making a strong contribution to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us invest in them , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be some internal discussions at Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear .
Tr@@ ump plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ launch coal mining in the USA .
oil extraction is also to be possible in so far protected areas , he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment program Clinton , on the other hand , intends to explicitly increase renew@@ ables and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid better then , for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ end , then he says he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics say that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fle@@ dged woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles away and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in Munich &apos;s north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs organized the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families are sending them to Europe as hope for hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women there are other reasons for the flight : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
whoever believes that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , re@@ counts B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that about 90 per cent of women living in the housing in Munich &apos;s north are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about what they have experienced , because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodation just for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the placing of refugees .
to the question whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no .
there is no such thing in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia in accommodations of the governments .
in Schw@@ aben , even fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are stories in some community shel@@ ters or their own houses for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can - - continually - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women .
just as the women feel this need for protection , you can read the crowds that are on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistants argu@@ ing : demands for new work struggle measures
assistant physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC concluded that ministers agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistant physicians and medical students voted in July about the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; would have remained a problem , which caused the treaty to be rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In light of this , the J@@ DC board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and demand official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work fighting measures that commen@@ ce at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that investig@@ ators fought six times this year , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the B@@ MA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana returned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 students and medical students that the agreement should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves their hands and proc@@ laim@@ ing an official end to the eight @-@ month long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed ta@@ sted and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his rec@@ eding circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved so as if something bad would never happen .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s bright , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was acute .
Putin dealt with and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , because it was done by a supposed boy@@ friend .
building up the ve@@ to will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all .
the alleg@@ ations of senior officials feared that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin had received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan to listen to .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Erdo@@ gan is primarily needed all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved of his office last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the State television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes are long here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
this includes continuing res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail stamp of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relations between Turkey and the West .
the Russian state chief won in Ankara a bonus that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one as an analy@@ st once described to portra@@ y &quot; the alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel bad and badly treated and now unite .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both pres@@ idents were saying that they had not even touched the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Executive Board of the Bank , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised headquarters and stock exchange quot@@ ations will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private clients that will gain more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor &apos;s brand as well as the brand under which our employees are employed , as we are now more to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Year sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop ourselves as a bank of brands , for how do we focus internally ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched those brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori exu@@ des champagne after a double at New@@ market , who gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , reaching the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ er when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys met the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ord@@ able career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thri@@ lled fans for years for this kind of sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already s@@ itt@@ led in the UK for almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying dis@@ mount
Flying F@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of British flat@@ race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven , 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received drug prohibition .
three years ago he had difficulty when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori has said earlier that he wants to continue at competitions up to his least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian President ur@@ ges Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the closest confidence circuit of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environment and Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is said that without stating reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Deputy Chairman since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the cler@@ k and chief executive of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and to leave V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
see the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow secret .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was , for a long time , one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ antes and works as he did for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin who was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cul@@ ing of the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are refer@@ enced on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust this job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted in most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another suppor@@ tive ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dis@@ mis@@ sal in a common position .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ olog@@ ised on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series follows , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzle for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff called for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fishes around Sand@@ als could take action , which were sp@@ aw@@ ed out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , on Per@@ is@@ cope published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ sl@@ ut cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ome cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness@@ ing an engineering of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the total deck @-@ deck is in their place and the last section of the deck is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete deck for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a major milestone for every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project is the closure of the trend @-@ setting high and low @-@ end construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck in the expansion , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate , because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately , everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station went on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties swimming while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and presented the worst of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hung on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coast@@ guard and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened when the boat was scra@@ ped off by the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .

who builds cheap apartments for Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors should be taken into duty in the future much more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living space &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in agreement with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to build on urban areas , it will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great controversy in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private grounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as little as 20 percent of the housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new municipal housing development program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , will provide incentives for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few regulations as possible .
the left still wants to be har@@ dening constraints for investors .
despite this , as Brat@@ mann , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet fully stand : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one deal with the loss of another approximately 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will run out over the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be bought out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
because in the western city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the western city is dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the aim of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged people in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect there to be any movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ sh@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can &apos;t yet be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness which is worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade .
Po@@ k@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and finally to smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course , I refer to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created first for video games in the 1990s ( later a series of carto@@ ons , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs originated from it ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ load .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , they can be &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game , when it was younger , joined the del@@ usion and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ stores every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch that pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people , who train every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance .
many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; hit de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the miracle of Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always , there are m@@ am@@ ish gam@@ bl@@ ers , who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could go against a door .
what is it supposed to be ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with activ@@ ism in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , more f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies &apos; tower
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is on all this immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on whole line .
and now finally an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American designer kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and final Five team player A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es cont@@ ests the women during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title , and overall the fifth while she has established her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport for the last three years , 15 world champi@@ ons - including 10 gold med@@ als - with amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited them a final exam in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between their and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in each of the women &apos;s individual multi @-@ combat activities at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed that during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , that is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion to the gymn@@ asi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a multi @-@ fight competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ afa led through two turns , the picture blur@@ red .
float beams and floor ur@@ ns - where Bil@@ es holds the world champion title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she picked up again at 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the bri@@ m@@ beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still sat on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her sof@@ tly when she expected her end result - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a margin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their ground practice they threw away kis@@ ses of the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : three victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ous case when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in Phoenix &apos;s first serial killer , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y case , because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard police spokes@@ man Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks during four months in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
one witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which dropped to an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during their pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself down on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still making &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l until his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to told C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to tell how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ded their shores and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding to extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness edness of the Govern@@ ors , announced that the en@@ quiries about high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the Municip@@ ality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had demanded tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts of south Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama there was a flood warning system on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a stream @-@ downward floo@@ ding in Ascension par@@ ish is a danger , as they will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the tro@@ dden rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State limit in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still shr@@ ank people from floo@@ ding in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his son @-@ in @-@ law were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed from Glo@@ ves on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strong overnight .
he said that he had warned him of another boot @-@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water was streaming and streaming in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that they had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which they lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he is the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency aid could have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ver where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had spread rapidly , as there were heavy rainf@@ alls and the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation statements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floor has been considerably reduced by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a school trip in five school districts .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS affiliate reported that a two @-@ or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both of which were floo@@ ded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets that were flus@@ hed by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were built to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to return , they will be able to go back to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the Municip@@ ality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided for the residents who hope to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the Municipal Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy told Har@@ rison counsel that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been reported floo@@ ded , but on Friday they were not reported .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered multiple injuries including the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was aware of his transportation to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has under@@ gone a lot , his little body was fl@@ attered by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ tem@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the sender that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is in a critical state , shot on , reports the sender .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge he@@ aders for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ looked the crime scene .
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were po@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police pat@@ er@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police station in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently under review to review the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a ri@@ f@@ le on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present at the gymn@@ asi@@ um in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that is more than a reason .
first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ as@@ tics , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is Catho@@ licon , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among the female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ an@@ ist .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so gymn@@ as@@ tics in the whole country do not look like that .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all took the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four female performers in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily contribute to private gymn@@ as@@ tics maintained by parents who pay for the training , orientation , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs , which can support business .
in these clubs the Tur@@ ner gets their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have exercised their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to offer an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym thanks to the numerous young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie .
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics foundation of 20 years .
we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that motiv@@ ates thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
that is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thanks , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant Physi@@ cians would like to organize more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ ,000 assistants who voted for a vote rejected it .
in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS had been found in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and would be det@@ ri@@ mental to any further delay for the employees and patients .
the first assistants should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend cal@@ endar@@ s in order to improve the care of un@@ attended clock times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the B@@ MA Committee for Regi@@ stra@@ ins shared last night in a message with : &quot; assistant physicians have still raised serious concerns about the proposed deal , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and it will be fo@@ ol@@ ed to do justice to all doctors . &quot;
with just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes had to take part in the government on account of reluc@@ tance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was done by a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t now has to act , lift up the en@@ forced and address the concerns of assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors on the strip post chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants a better week@@ end@@ compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , asked the assistants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work campaigns reach nothing of just a little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we talked to the assistant of the assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of curriculum , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health were concerned with regard to the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ating drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks .
N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the t@@ opping breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot loos@@ ens , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the N@@ ICE approach published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year at the dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of elec@@ tors from religious scenes would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up barrier tapes outside of electoral districts to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should carry out an identification document to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er must call his name and address .
the report suggests not to apply removable ink on a person &apos;s finger if they release their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , Sir Eric says .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ on should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man was said to have led &quot; his campaign on the ground that it was the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation where one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed particular al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading ID cards to prove their identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose , in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with a Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ ish background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric added 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit brief@@ ing documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election re@@ aps &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing after your identification .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three year limitation on applications for an automatic postal code .
ban that political activists edit full postal choices and envel@@ opes of postal choices .
the police will have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for election stations .
a change of law that facilitates an indictment for intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
ban on photograph@@ ing in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees rule out the rule that voters go alone to the voting booth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric follows the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there was no criminal complaint after Tower Ham@@ lets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the El@@ ection Court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his de@@ pu@@ ties un@@ fit for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons , according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ points &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registered offices of the town coun@@ cils . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities men@@ ace this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come out this week over the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T except the bri@@ m and the band , who proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games is by no means the only one to fight gold that has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack lots of people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star unc@@ anny .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity except facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess that &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the highlight of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa , with her big expressive eyes , should be able to go through the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption acting actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another long @-@ lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian Silver Med@@ al Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
other favorite compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ is at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle swi@@ mm@@ ers ou@@ tra@@ ged spectators of the C@@ BC Live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer , &quot; as M@@ ief went &quot; and died as &quot; a pig died &quot; during the race .
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle schwi@@ mm@@ el .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS &quot; commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
excit@@ edly , as he called , he died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ is , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor jer@@ k , which allowed the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers throughout Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; has died &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ is from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cri@@ tique of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , in which many talked about him
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ don@@ ald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who presented the C@@ BC programme live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are sorry that the comment on floating performance was broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate phrase , sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times to people who responded to the No@@ tice on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his excuse for more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed and issued a message .
we deeply regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on air and our followers in social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate phrase . B@@ yr@@ on is very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the con@@ sign@@ ment and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s lif@@ egu@@ ard in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I focused on the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
of course there was no cont@@ emp@@ t inten@@ tional and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly ta@@ sted under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyer did not know where to go , when a woman moved her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mor@@ dial to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation she numbered , as she looked at it , pulled her out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman ta@@ sted the under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled her own stock@@ ings trousers and pants and ta@@ sted her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that she obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like her , pulled out and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had ta@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the staff tried to pull out the clothes from the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had touched her and went out and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit more secure for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn it around for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you look behind you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shooting line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you strike it in your face with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with his knee in the chest and twist , while the Att@@ acker eng@@ ages in pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with as@@ sail@@ ants approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and turning the weapon onto it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how there is Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est thing to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
traveler Ian W@@ right ch@@ aps his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ lined his immune system and saus@@ age lex for serious testing by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shi@@ r@@ ked his train on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pulling button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before dropping any object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the idea of det@@ ecting the pur@@ ge of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left nothing to leak , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
from public transport to railway stations to flus@@ hing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set his immune system defini@@ tively among a rehear@@ sal
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial line showed a lumin@@ ous number of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet which he refused to refuse after her L@@ umin@@ ometer scale was over 4000 units , whereas freshly washed hands have less than 60 hands
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more suspi@@ cious than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings , who ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the bu@@ stling Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to them , d@@ anced them and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 per cent said they are at least occasionally using products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ ci@@ ale family destro@@ ys before deletion social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social in@@ dwelling after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a pound of £ 50,000 , because it terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ wash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative found sho@@ cking property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were perfor@@ ated , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family have been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for house@@ keeping at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said the terror that the family had joined , street fighting with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation by residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ fes and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an order for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wooden boards were torn up
neighbours said they had to fight on the street and police had to be inv@@ oked on a regular basis
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing organised her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily und@@ ress .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ants were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , testified that the family would have agreed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house waste and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant would agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their families , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be horri@@ ble .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the Police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti@@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house .
house@@ keeping workers will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don got a fine , after she had been guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti coated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will navigate the ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told Angela C@@ row that del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the Air Force stated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless Jet is crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun @-@ an@@ em@@ ers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped on when they began to worry about the noise of the nozzle @-@ engines , without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in social media , said : &quot; twice really flew very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach had panic when the plane came out of darkness and was incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility , the area could be somewhat lower than usual due to the poor visibility of the area , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety was not at all je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed at all times .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people also died on Madeira island .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise

Ma Long in a Private League to Table Tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and defending champion Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale .
thus the World Ran@@ king first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and Olympic Games .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would score the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no aches with themselves .
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ ests in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches up to here have been played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said to be logical . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts pos@@ ing with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly single @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
then he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang out there only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless enough breath @-@ taking ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White rus@@ se had suffered a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump conce@@ als &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced the weakness of his campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dant Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary said something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts are growing at his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida and Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty of false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media rebu@@ ke .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds go up
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey by surv@@ ey@@ Americans from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were equal to the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see ump in the front , but not with the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the CN@@ BC station , Tr@@ ump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party is said to have threatened to withdraw funds for the support of its electoral campaign , it should not present any better survey figures .
instead of taking the candidates from the Republi@@ cans to Congress more strongly to the Congress .
Olympics : three frau@@ ds with dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are facing the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee ordered to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to carry out their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson informed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been in Beijing World Cup @-@ fourth more than 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before , Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics deleg@@ ate Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending Dop@@ ing tests against the fin@@ es of his country .
according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation for quite some time with IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing events .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing bill and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD has repeatedly raised accus@@ ations that dop@@ ing drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and there is to be a significant ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired in Russian athle@@ tics .
in this sport , it was proven that in this type of sport it was systematically and systematically supp@@ ressed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the classical temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth room .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra under the bat@@ on of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with it .
it is an enormously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his g@@ lan@@ ces , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time they had gone to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same themes , and today they are as meaningful as they were then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , died according to reports in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war@@ med land and return to England .
&quot; we can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks connected with it , to go into a war zone - to prevent people from ever meeting this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London aboard a plane in the direction of Turkey followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow in a few months .
Rei@@ d claims that in the case of election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked the acknowled@@ gement of the country since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ ena .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he would expect Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Rei@@ d spokesperson said later that he had not yet talked to Clinton to nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Republi@@ cans blocked the nom@@ ination of the Guard , were Lak@@ ai@@ en and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants to give neck @-@ cal@@ endar@@ s for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine distinguishes itself from Old@@ school Play@@ boys as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , it is the view that the calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness , in which women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the Cal@@ endar@@ s .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who does not care and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh en@@ cro@@ achment of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term with some hundred thousand protected seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already covered months of Kurdish civil war with sanctions , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the tur@@ vy put@@ sch still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that accepts refugees is producing refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association depl@@ ored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
so Erdo@@ gan may want to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the federal government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; position as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the brand mark as a Gü@@ len pendant destro@@ ys the professional existence of teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t care and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the c@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised for political prosecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all eligible patients ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey do not find those who are fled from war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
in 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as up to now it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and country elections - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the comb@@ at@@ ants , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the country day .
in addition , there are practical problems : during the vac@@ ations , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count votes at the end of the day , only to bu@@ dge up with difficulty .
until September 4 , 2016 , the last day of the election and the last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let itself pass through a campaign of elections close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ism .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral campaign , seen from his grand posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor , Harald Ring@@ storff did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , se@@ ering has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the right office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time one makes electoral campaigns at the right place .
Angela Merkel has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations . Angela Merkel is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lam@@ ented Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a pity not to listen to Angela Merkel once again from other corners of Germany .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country , it is crum@@ bling the base that it must very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any left in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ tor co@@ ke on his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , Every Bir@@ th@@ day celebration must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to become a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were ultimately 22 percent behind CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only slightly ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD won still clearly at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays and spend their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls it the chairman of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go on a search for trace @-@ search for local voters under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it still beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 renovation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and end only at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are everywhere praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all made it pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was reloc@@ ated to the south by the end of October until the end of October .
this is also commen@@ ded with the receipt of those responsible for the construction works , for example when it comes to the establishment of mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft trips .
since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg will be resum@@ ed , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the cre@@ denti@@ al traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were sometimes considerable complaints , &quot; says Florian King , responsible for the rehabilitation management of the rehabilitation project .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to a fran@@ chise of some trucks in residential areas ?
since speed limit@@ ings were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality increasingly called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant exagger@@ ations , &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation .
two to three per minute have been heated .
the fastest was on the way at 77 mph ( 77 mph ) in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that the street is open for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales collap@@ ses can be seen through every one you ask .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier as well , but also ad@@ mits that of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the imp@@ etus is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local spots along the road .
J. G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
this is exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all guest houses have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue losses are reduced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road refur@@ bish@@ ment has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages that arise through the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows about other administrative districts , where so much more generous is handled .
with all complaints G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regul@@ ars are now less frequent because of complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t get around it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his regular client@@ ele will come back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises of BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
all the time , in the name of fighting terrorism , laws are being bol@@ ted .
after the latest proposals , Home Affairs Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a d@@ ull status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ take anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also in charge of this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was in charge of results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has left a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some are already known , announced , pointed out : that a new security authority is to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new .
nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man conce@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still believes this to be reasonable and also doesn &apos;t demand anything that the coalition partner has no chances anyway .
a few new ideas are also being presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to det@@ ach people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted at the country will have to check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check .
in case of den@@ ial for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are political and legal .
many things also still seem to be poured out and leave questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient ones for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère says that it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in the face of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that people deeply occupied allowed themselves to be excluded even during election campaigns .
the inner security has moved immen@@ sely into the focus .
just the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly taking their position in the issue of inner security .
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a long @-@ standing dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ or@@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a single pass away from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it is not useful .
and with a bur@@ q@@ ban ban , he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all angles and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things in it , which might cause stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is also currently trying to profit from the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel cau@@ ti@@ ously signals the readiness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still gli@@ ding through .
despite the diesel prices , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it is not in all markets .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered .
despite the lack of diesel , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer continues to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
however , in July , the Volkswagen brand was weak@@ ening mainly in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened its overall sales , such as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand sold 1,@@ 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars in July with 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market after China alone , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the German home market , shipments bag@@ ged almost one hund@@ red@@ th .
brand distributor Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought the weaker figures out of July , especially on two sales days , less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a reluc@@ tance to buy in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on leaving the EU stressed that a female speaker said .
in the USA , where the ab@@ at@@ ement of the ab@@ at@@ ement was first escal@@ ated , a minus sign is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is further gli@@ mmer@@ ing further by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a further sale from January to July .
Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after upgrading the car , the car manufacturer will issue a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t talk about a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate circles .
reason are legal fin@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen now gives its German customers a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry committee and KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting , no deterior@@ ations will take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen themselves does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles .
in the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen clearly sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in customer interest it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , as it was said to be un@@ secured with regard to possible warranty regulations .
for this reason VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on bank or bank accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not be afraid to pay pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ al code . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund to return from private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding EUR 100,000 on bank or bank accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been guar@@ ding 40 million Euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle , the costs are now passed on .
leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve seen four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to wear alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically feasible not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger county had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Head of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele which is luxuri@@ antly furnished by the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no longer known to other banks which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ PR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold of going into neg@@ atives towards private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged men love records .
before comm@@ itting to the comment section , you can re@@ strain him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym &quot; Non @-@ Alle@@ e Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ ors &quot; of the Middle Ages with harsh insul@@ ts . this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the widely discussed recovery of vinyl records is not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news from physical objects but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght inferior to the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s results ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , I would follow the camera as I run in a busy street in Soh@@ o , wear a humble grey suit and stu@@ ffed wild before I stand , hold my hands and say something determin@@ ant like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which independent sellers were formerly based - there still remains a handful of fantastic sheet specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two middle @-@ aged men , three middle aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they appeared and re @-@ selling items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy plates are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets will apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pupp@@ y , people who have heard about their com@@ eback and set themselves to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have led , people usually got rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of followers of the plate @-@ revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to see that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers offen@@ ded the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects that evo@@ ke happy memories of youth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be a feeling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month did not yet listen to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I go through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ els .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just came here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older people who come in slowly .
mo@@ p , which has dedicated nearly a whole floor to the records , has a lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ eted Pop instead of experimental jazz dri@@ es from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but bad mental trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping as a big purchase .
it does not deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I appear to bol@@ ster the pants pants pants , I watch a group of young age girls group@@ ing themselves together for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disk art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there &apos;s nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records .
although my investigations yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , are un@@ accounted for by the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with security st@@ rolling through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who domin@@ ates nothing of middle @-@ aged men &apos;s shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects proposals on demoli@@ tion of businesses in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary stores in which people inside the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , bar@@ ber services , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and health risk .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people operating the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in public and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mig@@ rants &apos; Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimates on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number by now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite the Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains comb@@ ative
in spite of his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic time , cycling professionals Tony Martin will not let himself be enter@@ tained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly don &apos;t think it &apos;s hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in silence what reasons were led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ tening devices will be tested , which should be super@@ se@@ ded particularly effectively .
the futur@@ istic reinforcement Tra@@ iler from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident points where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary speed limit there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there is a stationary gl@@ itter to comply with speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can however be too dangerous or cum@@ ber@@ some .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days for continuous measuring operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be detected at the same time over several tracks .
variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans according to time , distance and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply cl@@ oned , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels van@@ ish in the arm@@ oured and by the way also sh@@ ing@@ less outer h@@ ull .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 units last year .
UK cat@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ player Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji &apos;s Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by reached a sudden stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is in the final on Thursday night , when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the bot@@ tling stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji passed a master class in handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , back , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was defeated by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back on them in the final .
but independently of it Fi@@ ji could have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ry@@ an , former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago they lost Ry@@ an every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lose one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the attacks explo@@ de out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one were running in driving buses . the World Series winners left 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was beating in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly gr@@ asp@@ ed the ball .
a h@@ ep@@ y T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua went down a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new member since the re@@ play and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u hit the UK team &apos;s weak tac@@ kl@@ ings and stor@@ med until the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still gut@@ ted .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was going through after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South Sea sul@@ try , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s playful approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ am put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ ff sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB wi@@ ped out crus@@ hing in the law@@ ns .
earlier on that day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the post in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by combat with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than these games and that will mean what .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve who enter into history Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the ru@@ dder , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when they row@@ ed for the second Olympic gold in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that set such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written commitment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ letes that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was no one more instrumental than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer that is operating and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a very bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
that is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even greater challenge .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ raising morning to talk more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . this may be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or a better coach .
during the last five years Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning won no race .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; remain in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
this would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exemplary for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ s@@ stein@@ Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; water @-@ purpose association , Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , retired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the big water producers .
this was the case some time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken paid tribute to the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ l@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was a member of the association for 31 years , stands for 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ r@@ stein group with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , transports approx . 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water supply contracts are available for other cities and municipalities .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ n Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was appointed as a water@@ mark in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there have been no down@@ times and I have always added new things because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ r@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia District .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , on his turn , praised the water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful pop @-@ up .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
in his view , he called the fountain building and the restructuring of the purpose association .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the tu@@ bing in the elevated tank near Kirch@@ berg on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
the supply of new brun@@ n can be maintained only once , because the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt was filled with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something , which is two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he rec@@ alls nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

type of Relation@@ ship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots to partner of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man was killed on Friday at 10.@@ 45@@ am in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and injured it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man inv@@ oked us and stated to have shot his girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I will be publicly punished .
meanwhile , nationwide because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald head .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon in himself , like the police .
anyone who sees Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no information about the trial or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but she confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity extraction are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renewable Energy envelope in the existing systems of the so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said to WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but this too is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
this means that the status quo of the previous arrangement will be widely as@@ cer@@ tained .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our steel campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets must be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a substantial price pressure .
last year , the situation wor@@ sen@@ ed further , when China &apos;s world &apos;s largest producer of manufactures fell heavily on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European producers have given price dump@@ ing to Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation is somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel have an impact on imports ; on the other hand , economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
at the end Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity left behind each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in emissions .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp had already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl , she was in the school choir . in the course of studies she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in an elderly choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall vivid , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German Senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular cooperation , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures break up at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a chor@@ us is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , meaning H@@ ac@@ kler says .
in doing so , senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing .
those who demand his lungs regularly will not get out of the pu@@ ff as soon as possible in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
older people often have a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations , singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people w@@ akes a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
lyrics and especially melodies slow down even people with dementia in long @-@ lying events .
in the case of singing , a special power is required to the head , L@@ enz explains .
concentr@@ ating simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adap@@ ting itself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just older people who live on their own are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the feeling of self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for something long , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are plenty of good reasons to start singing .
anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , Sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior fen@@ nel , you can simply join .
many cities also provide over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the Church leader directly .
many elderly choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the Internet research .
if you want to sing , you should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensitive than boys to cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the rep@@ lication of cat babies has on adult animals .
to their surprise also the males did not leave the males cold - however , they always remained the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of cat babies at the mi@@ ch@@ ewing of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists found out at the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens are different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
nine adults and eight female males were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a cry of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens raised in addition .
despite the small sample , the researchers consider their results to be conclu@@ sive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when the cri@@ es of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ uses with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , another important football match is taking place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already at the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be affected .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch .
this does not stop even before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former strong @-@ man Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
accordingly , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is said to be the follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , actually this has no effect on the life of most Turks but as good as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan an end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into adher@@ ents and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club do not traditionally count among the friends of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially true to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne demonstrated its athle@@ tic value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g it just reached sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done that , and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of the game was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig with 26 seasons of the season .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
the Gom@@ ez borrow@@ ed from AC Florence under contract and sent to Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the attempted coup attempt to not return to his European holiday due to the political situation in the country .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say , &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club boss Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to wai@@ ve around a third of his annual salary estimated to 7.5 million Euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ man said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als @-@ opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a Dop@@ ing lock sounded their right before the games , became mer@@ cil@@ essly pi@@ ped out and rested on their start ( 100 metres chest ) .
it offered herself a sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : she was still standing in the hall with a super@@ sti@@ tious smile and provoked her appearance .
when it was clear that she was not going to get gold , the audience went out into a flood @-@ storm .
but there are many more sports@@ men who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was closed two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit down for six months in 2010 after receiving the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European champi@@ onships , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the sent@@ in@@ el sei@@ z@@ ure and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and has been closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , em@@ bedding Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ lete was recognized as many med@@ als later .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympic silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championship for testosterone abuse .
he also received the Bronze Med@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Court of Justice CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he stands on rank two of the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record dealer and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may nevertheless start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world cup clu@@ es were found on the consumption of a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran already on July 13th .
bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I was able to leave it again .
they planned their home@@ ward journey at the beginning of September .
it is still unclear whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also affected by Austrian citizens .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two explosive charges went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb det@@ onation in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in det@@ onation in the vicinity of the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , which was popular during vac@@ ation@@ ers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a city cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police station .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injured .
it was said that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ att@@ ent@@ ates carry the same signature , &quot; said Brig@@ adi@@ er General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to manifest itself to possible causes , but probably it is the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs have been bom@@ bed by opponents of the ruling j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities would have received intelligence on the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and locations .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police reported to their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always small bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace that was used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the new bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding its homepage to follow the instructions given by Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after clas@@ hes between the security forces and the Muslim population , not necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased security risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ affir@@ ms itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not manage to get a grip on the revol@@ ving rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ S@@ hr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ fiable movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several local authorities , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also set the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are witness@@ ing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Minister Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ine of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from the Islamic faith or the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ fiable movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in nine German states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely coordinated with the local authorities in the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a more you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a pu@@ zz@@ ling publicity for your own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states on the contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said that he had no knowledge .
possible contacts of this type are only relevant for constitutional protection from a certain point onwards .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in justified crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ine said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be real @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other religious groups or small groups form that plan attacks on asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of rights terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups had ar@@ isen on the regional level or in social networks .
worried parents worried that many attacks on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the cause of concern .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , but then radic@@ alised themselves by far @-@ right extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympics or World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro summer games .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight guy from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old concludes with a 48 @-@ second set@@ back and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old nevertheless take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received special start@@ rights from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to make swimming more known in under@@ represented countries .
as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the turn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media reported him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of a &quot; prosperity bar , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny about him .
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 yards Fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
the running of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
the swi@@ mmer from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable , when he had to compete on his own in a for@@ en@@ oon of more than 100 metres .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically che@@ ered at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t see the threat of electoral defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
should it be nothing with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
loses Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately , it will either swing , or I have a very nice , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC .
if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
he called US President Barack Obama and the democr@@ ats of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post increases in trade with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle from Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously large .
the post plans to sell their electric car Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
in the near future , the company wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been evaluating for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed street sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ executive Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries about arti@@ sans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to news from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in post @-@ production operations , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and made P@@ ut a complete transition to the eco @-@ friendly vehicles in the long run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .
the road sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP @-@ leadership replaces dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ pipes came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K has shown that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after another dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the global number Five of the industry faces a new beginning .
at the end of the year , the G@@ RP Executive Board wants to leave the company .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahler is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management of the Executive Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger as of September 1 , informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the back@@ log , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy alignment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention details .
in the future , anyone who will lead the market research company is still unclear .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , at last the dis@@ appointment regarding the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago was great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the G@@ RP summit since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen even after 5 years . &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this was the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company failed to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the equivalent figure of the previous year &apos;s quarter .
in the first half of the year , sales contracted by 3.4 per cent to 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros .
in view of its difficult economic situation , profit in the second quarter largely imp@@ acted the decline in value of the company .
the company &apos;s impair@@ ment charges of EUR 139 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
in an accident of a bus with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , reported the police .
according to her specifications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade a truck that was on the back@@ track .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as reported by the police officer of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus automatically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency medical ambul@@ ances came to the accident scene on the state road 2 .
the unexpected travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a substitute bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater from October 1st 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previous 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previous 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after an over@@ riding calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the Office of the Office of the Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ cover runs for these sewage treatment plants .
due to legal foundations , the village of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants at a cost @-@ saving manner .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens , as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt showed up to the Board , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ tak@@ ings from the previous calculation period will also be compensated .
Schmidt thus founded the serious charge increases in all three wastewater facilities around relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , in the back @-@ lying cal@@ c@@ cul@@ ation period , renov@@ ations and repair expenses were significantly reduced in all three plants due to their age .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the Az@@ endorf waste water plant .
in the pumping station Wel@@ chen@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and during the pond sewage treatment L@@ opp , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dischar@@ ged after almost 20 years . the slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system was installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water accumulation in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance will be &quot; fully sl@@ apped . &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of major maintenance costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed .
according to stone houses , the situation for these facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , particularly as the area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach valley wastewater association can not be extended by these facilities because it is a lack of public facilities .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July inflation in Bulgaria amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first one above zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a rise in prices for the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education remained unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
snap@@ chat tells us that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , the Snap@@ chat facility enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ unted , self @-@ winding tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all false entries reach the public .
snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the application of black face or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them s@@ lit @-@ eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indignation were widely circul@@ ated on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after the Snap@@ chat announced it would have disabled the feature .
the company had an excuse : the filter was thought to be an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asian characters .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widely used across the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and in@@ convenient . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian carto@@ on and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been drag@@ ged into the ab@@ wer@@ able extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ wire .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands .
and snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different than their older counter@@ parts in terms of race - could rather expect to expect sensitivity .
if one of snap@@ ch@@ ats creates an image that insul@@ ts a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to go un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account , and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that ra@@ cial issues reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely un@@ answered the Snap@@ chat .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , the company refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a human resource manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu in turn said she will close her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military guide fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS secret service information , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on the ground , reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of Republi@@ can members of the army committees , intelligence committees and military budget compromise , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , a short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence gathering provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders regularly recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism when it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ Com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government spi@@ kes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements submitted to Congress were much more positive than it met the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ p@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , the heads of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans launched the Task Force after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
in addition , the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Ministry of Defense &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force conclusions .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking democr@@ at in the Committee , Member of the Adam B. Bo@@ at Repres@@ ent@@ atives in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med the moral of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention at the Cent@@ Com analysts as regards a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , who after complaints received by Cent@@ Com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense did not comment on the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor is still ongoing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government officials stated that contrary to the statements of the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger governor , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain
a day after she scored three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever having done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
but she knows this : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who are unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch , who lead the other group .
however the game might go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whi@@ r@@ l through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn matters into a better one .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we have now .
we can completely ro@@ de the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a back action from the local area .
India had gone into the game without victory , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she carried a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and pl@@ ung@@ ed the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the age of the Olympic Games , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and unavoid@@ able , a fast @-@ pac@@ ed relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the gymn@@ ast to tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the Coff@@ es@@ hop queue without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .

Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well be among these well @-@ known names that are sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ law .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely noticed the last 16 years that many people , I had questioned , did not know that it is at all an Olympic port@@ ability .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
the trampoline jumping has some outside charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending bo@@ unc@@ ing - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that are essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet into the air and have to shoot a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ itting and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
they are rated according to official Olympic program according to design , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but in the television transmission also another sne@@ ak@@ y goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it is also what I feel ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen like the contest at the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13 : 00 pm .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the ang@@ ling and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the Male American Tur@@ ner has recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to meet .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia launched the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at shot changes .
is Ethiopia coming together right now ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people pl@@ ung@@ ed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shooting and killing un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the head of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror haz@@ ards beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies were the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament .
at the same time tensions escal@@ ate along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged and controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years have been defeated more or less , could use the tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of inc@@ and@@ escence under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services improved .
even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians believed they were gathering so much protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special agents to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for reasons of relatively non@@ transparent reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region north of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands protest against elections , seemingly b@@ ung@@ led by the government and subsequently stolen by the government .
during the following ra@@ ids dozens of prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last few months and this period of un@@ rest was relatively quickly over .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ance of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , businesses run by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a unique position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin atro@@ city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump states his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking his repeated asser@@ tion that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton had not been seriously meant to be the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republi@@ cans , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who endeav@@ or to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to asser@@ t statements that he could not have meant .
after making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump rec@@ alled the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism lashes out on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of falling conver@@ gence levels on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
reporting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m back to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to ru@@ dder back as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more corro@@ sive tone , as his survey figures have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leadership with a big lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general is trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is increasingly in focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps j@@ okes his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back @-@ but@@ cher , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by being aggressive in the Middle East .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked ap@@ ologi@@ zing for Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once over the price of the market , cafe in Green@@ point returns
verb Cafe was a fo@@ aming café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices came from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people lost it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is ex@@ tri@@ cated and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it &apos;s also new invention .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes like cap@@ ers and fried onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , previously lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the road .
after the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee t@@ ines for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though on this day instead of her usual iced coffee , she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth to seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and pick up new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the soap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re going to respond to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
a new client has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill and sell cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Fi@@ fth Avenue delicacies such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
its menu on that day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ egel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealt with Chinese food in the USA while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ app@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the market crash of 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Co@@ e , 57 , Turkey ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter h@@ ack@@ r@@ ame ordered this , this found the couple for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap food that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; hon@@ ours the ways with which the country avoided being no longer the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e comm@@ ited , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new bud@@ dy diet : mysterious dishes such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole were added to stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ use food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noted , as chefs could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruits .
meat that has been the center of American cuisine for years has become a rarely servi@@ ced luxury .
peculiar bl@@ ends have been tried , as a rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
while resear@@ ching the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to noon , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - worked out the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household polic@@ emen , &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ as such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake food pose , are particularly tasty .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he was eating like the million @-@ weight man from the world to whom he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was really realistic to reality .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt would perhaps have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt made that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was afraid of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind bag incident .
after leaving the plates with Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a nice name with modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
surprisingly it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took an extra charge three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar reli@@ ed his life on the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself has died at a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civil protection groups that , according to the picture paper , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives in the game to get people out of bom@@ bed houses and to get first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian protective visor who showed him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think that God is a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have thrown four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to strike terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate @-@ animal is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ hair@@ s usually come to the surface only in winter .
after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea aboard the S@@ anna research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland has only 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6@@ km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lon@@ el@@ iness characterized by lon@@ el@@ iness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Gr@@ ön@@ land shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments on this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolution@@ ist has long argued that Greenland will be st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s hair@@ s are hard to watch , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated shores of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
scientists know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
they measured their slow motion when they out@@ fitted six animals with one transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
prey this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the basis of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which are tor@@ turing from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied now 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , with the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers in size .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
its birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempt to bring large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons test , thus celebrating its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland h@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res should be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ hai @-@ females first get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ y with the multip@@ lication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coinci@@ dence that such meth@@ yl@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ ön@@ land w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon peak was stuck , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often also runs on a flame @-@ flame .
they mature later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
the municipal council has focused on issues relating to building in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the board accepted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ wal@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Building section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties after the land plots have been clari@@ fied and the applications for surve@@ ying have been clari@@ fied .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ru@@ sty senior citizens alike .
as it was said , Bau@@ will@@ s can now announce themselves in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to consult its September meeting on the allocation of the plots .
in order to also demand en@@ quiries about the settlement of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of work@@ places , the Municipal Council decided to change the newly created land use plan only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Lower @-@ time , the industrial area , which is already proven there , is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Competence Center for the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether fin@@ es should continue to run from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the so @-@ called EU passport is sufficient for them to be approved in the UK so far .
this is what big US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B .
although in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg insi@@ sts on a large fund sector , it also cuts down in infrastructure as well as in the infrastructure of Dublin .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
in addition , the town boasts easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main River .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer management consultancy , the city ranked 7th in seventh , Luxembourg in No. 19 , Dublin in 3rd place and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
the balance of forces : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to refund the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ s C li@@ tigation with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead released a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of Justice Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction of the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained each other and claimed property on laboratory work , which was based on Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
U.S. support forces say that they reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops backed by the United States have taken full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb the city after the passage of the still remaining group of fighters buried within the city .
they have free over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan told the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters who joined the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which revealed an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the pres@@ idency of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ mption C@@ emetery ; the former Secretary of State admitted an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false exc@@ uses and trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the democr@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ers , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not complete .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business ties and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she also talked about the topic during a talk about the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax advis@@ ors and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , ump into a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an I@@ RS tax check and was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return by the year 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 tax return showed that they paid only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike the majority of all Americans .
their main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian eleph@@ ants &apos; protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements in humans - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , intensified its funding by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is World tel@@ eph@@ ones Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ ill@@ ac@@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , the end of which is turned to the ignition switch .
when lit , the con@@ dom burst with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust on chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a touch right usually goes out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last possibility is a score that sho@@ ots a golden fire@@ works into the air , causing a noisy , bright explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no hor@@ os@@ cope building on the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhine river

however , the town council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales office on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony located in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ people , but this ki@@ osk does not fit in an exposed location on the shores of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director dis@@ sec@@ ts Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock , after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre@@ fix , as Arab guests were &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and extingu@@ ished ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there was &quot; sho@@ cking him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the employee of Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a major dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have &quot; yiel@@ ded &quot; the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article where it was pointed out that the hotel that is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Syn@@ agog@@ ue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; Israel did not enter the quick election list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
it adds that the country code has been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students gathered in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to police rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti spra@@ yed against the temporary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets in order to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been reli@@ eved from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran rises suddenly to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade expansion was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan looks for a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian representative issued around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as far as the number of tourists in Russia is concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken by the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the Ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

under stock@@ pil@@ es of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the issu@@ ance of cash and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money has been captured .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly visible from the market deck of the Re@@ we market .
the perpetr@@ ators must be fled to Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and flee from the gravel parking lot located opposite the car park entrance to the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y are reported to report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun at daylight saving time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker .
in the quiet leisure district of Hard@@ tw@@ in@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was accommod@@ ated during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the strike z@@ oos .
on the other hand , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group had fun at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
culinary delights were given to children and car@@ ers with their own cour@@ ty@@ ards , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops we created beautiful pieces of jewellery made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill @-@ game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of the home journey the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the min@@ ts from the soul care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the period up to the next Roma transit of all the altar regi@@ stran@@ ts in a period of two years , the meeting of the mini@@ stries of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally one decided for the city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the opening of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the sanctuary , made their way .
in the evening before , Father Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and told the pilgrims &apos; blessing .
from Hor@@ b , there was a train to Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster @-@ loved @-@ loved wife stands and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s way was taken from the Min@@ ster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always made a rest to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgri@@ m song .
the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal for the overnight stays .
at the stage targets Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty and delicious dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after that , one stepped up the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first about 500 metres of al@@ timet@@ ers had to be lowered and then drow@@ ned .
in the evening , the deser@@ ved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond .
after the morning impulse in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to Freiburg on the final stage .
Min@@ is was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy in the afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gate of mercy .
thanks to a small imp@@ etus , God was thank@@ ed here .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t who arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the Sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ metropolis .
in the afternoon I went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ land Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced in the men team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio last evening , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . he made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home in order to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic gold med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the newcom@@ er Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as an exec@@ ution@@ er .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement generated a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner made an Olympic board in the Quali@@ fication Round , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des was almost back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ des drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic board in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start , he fell sharply on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a superb victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Thom@@ son , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were also born ) - a prey of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would come from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is going to take part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be defeated as a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ mile race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the World Record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , where the focus will be on W@@ ig@@ gins .
yesterday he had argued with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e advanced in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong team of rail to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a tro@@ op of med@@ als .
after a truly remarkable presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama was played in the background , such as the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the midst of sex and bul@@ b@@ bing accus@@ ations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first night of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks as if the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melt of Port@@ land due to lifting the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places by workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to not grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy that is set for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ places - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined Point Henry Schmel@@ sch@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea Power Plant last year .
Al@@ coa mel@@ ted in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step is followed by years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally on the basis of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium mold with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p holding smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential effects on the revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts from the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual fee of $ 18@@ 7 million in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of a termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to susp@@ end the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not impaired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration why it has res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ age facility near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and tom@@ bs each year to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vog@@ ue
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
San Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Antonio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , hyp@@ ed reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ unc@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ Rest ) , which ends with a classic turn : they have all planned a surprise party .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ical action of almost every birthday sep@@ sis of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ ular brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a broadcasting station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris did not have to let her other girls participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine &apos;s September edition is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a circum@@ ference that tends to resem@@ ble a photographic book rather than a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to the 8@@ 32 pages of the newspaper 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover @-@ star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the low chance that Ms J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls below the previous category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , appearing on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers won &apos;t like success to everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings came up again when the news came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but walking around on the m@@ ess seems to pass by the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vog@@ ue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; September issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters will sell you pictures of your pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community Centr@@ es annually disp@@ ose of 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s most relief funds are reported annually by the municipal real centers , while the sector faces the effects of further funds on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ v@@ ings and similar - are rejected for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already exc@@ essively busy , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the community centre of Que@@ bec , James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey of the National Coalition of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have been exp@@ elled every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically funded , which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need will be forced from Que@@ ens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to lift these funds immediately so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for aid to national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Camp@@ aig@@ n indic@@ ted after Emplo@@ ye@@ es allegedly S@@ itting We@@ ap@@ ons
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after it has been told that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February turned a fire@@ arm on a staff while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte &apos;s Provin@@ cial Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i agreed to have been waiting for months to settle the issue internally , before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vinc@@ ente &apos;s knee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining with the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave up in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons don &apos;t have to be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the In@@ dict@@ ment only comes two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a rebellion when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm and weapons lover - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was to be elected and appoint judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign clearly stated that the media had torn away his words from the context and that he would not viol@@ ate the violence .
ordin@@ is Compl@@ aint claims compensation from the campaign for breach of due dili@@ gence and Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
hope Hi@@ cks from Tr@@ um@@ ps was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , innovative consulting services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far managed a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : election in front of federal elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( 4th September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) substantial losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had a good chance of continuing to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were reluc@@ tant to return to the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Parliament at 3 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the survey of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the pol@@ l of the pol@@ l would only come to 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it was thus still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties at 14 per cent for the first time .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , whereas the pir@@ ates would miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ o and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not well in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be sufficient today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9@@ communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet era .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the western ash format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ Browser , al@@ beit agon@@ izing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , al@@ beit not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos;s cell phone industry experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , suppliers dominate the market , all of which came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that is for many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million pieces .
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
an entire industry has been created around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet @-@ communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use via touch screen .
the Apple prize draw started , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had a look at it .
they eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the band now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German looks now 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must lead the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we had a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics had great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are already 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces alone , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will put ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ellers were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row too .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is a infrastructure project for many and not for individuals .
expansion is a way of creating up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in real growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal until the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London 2012 games were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to draw this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

add Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking are equal to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blo@@ oming on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding for his advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o @-@ battle between the upcoming open source community and the b@@ unk@@ ers has already been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has become involved in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying sign@@ blo@@ oms have become for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display blo@@ cker ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the ad revenue .
the company has no effect on Desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a speaker shared .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a big share of revenue so that Facebook won the investment of such a step as rewar@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preference tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a d@@ ull means , which is why we have instead concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
leave a woman on Swiss motorway at presum@@ able suicide
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 in the proximity of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 wanted to kill himself by several vehicles , including a truck , to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , calling this and every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Court @-@ etter informed the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hof@@ st@@ etter said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person walking in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers must not assume that a pedestrian runs on the motorway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted , after having crossed a man and killed a man lying near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , the court rejected .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who responded to an emergency call -- to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Cli@@ m@@ am@@ o@@ del : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA air model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms resem@@ bling those of climate resear@@ ches .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have re@@ ared up similar conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still revol@@ ved slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet would probably have more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus expon@@ enti@@ ally increases its tag@@ ging side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution , which was previously thought by planet scientists .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect back -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a low co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
during the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it greater depth , that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be perfectly adapted to the organisation .
he also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Z@@ acc@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , expressed his thanks for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the night@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches featured a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ sten Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
normal ee@@ pers resume talks , strike on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles in respect of wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the conten@@ ders sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider have been spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of settlement of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , which will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice is followed by a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of its meg@@ a@@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in expenses for new projects in the North Sea are expected to be around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ fare Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star @-@ pile rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are connected with the planet formation .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Re@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster of stars is 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are turning quick@@ est now .
at peak rotation rates these po@@ ign@@ ant stars rep@@ el large amounts of star win@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a det@@ ectable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less solid stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , while larger stars turn slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster of stars provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base .
after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say good@@ bye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most prestigious player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him $ 27 million annually .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed to make some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 year old should not be included in the rest of the bas@@ eball hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star submitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have taken forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez sweet at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days do not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball @-@ legends in their last games received the big stage again , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win each game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and portra@@ yed the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
&quot; &quot; &quot; caught : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of a positive dop@@ ing test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Poland in Rio may not start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a well @-@ known ath@@ lete had almost won a medal .
before the seventh day of the competition , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter obstacle runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already cri@@ tically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end .
the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was found in Ch@@ en last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ ked agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Court of Sport CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the runs over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested an opening of the B sample and a hearing .
the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news se@@ eps through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance will deal with the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B test should have already had a positive effect .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported his criticism to the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both of them dispute the intake , but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ owa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association , except for systematic dop@@ ing , banned the launch of the entire Russian team , and the Ken@@ yan campaign also produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , in addition , the previous violations in China caused severe disputes between athletes .
so Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio .
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested in 2014 with the Chinese nation@@ als positively to the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine but had to sit down only a three month lock .
data c@@ law : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes below 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 per cent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators strongly speci@@ alize in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially black@@ out ran@@ som is much higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling spe@@ edy evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes &apos;s chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail for themselves .
at first , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was very sc@@ ary over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delete the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final turn code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users use the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage is incurred when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to completely under@@ mine their business activity , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of hospital acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in view of stagn@@ ation in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure tested the user interface and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and came to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims by chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or unlock for free sample files .
and if private individuals are redeemed by payments of only a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , says Safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four people .
the programmers sell their malware in the form of a software build box to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware @-@ kits used to date were created by buying malware , counsel@@ ing and additional tools for a single , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included is a fitting tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says .
the black@@ mail then searches for other h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then engage sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ semination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes poll@@ s survey rely on the ability to ward off Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is no longer a threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators are instead threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes &apos;s chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could have completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could control a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l at high raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ ett@@ le and offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work a little qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering should be a little more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment does not leave any wishes un@@ fulfilled in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he points many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when manoeu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed regulator re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed as required .
but full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more .

airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable at dangers that are typical for aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee cap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
case of illness : when does the organizer get paid ?
patients with ill health will only receive money after their trip if the cause of the disease is indisp@@ utable in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proved to have the same symptoms .
in the case of the case a family was ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of its wake .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness brought the holi@@ day@@ makers back to a defective treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained against the organizers .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had no success in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the promot@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of inform@@ ing , so the sentence .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the atro@@ cities committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be sensible and determined to respond to terrorist threats at the same time .
for sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and divisions .
we will not treat this triumph for the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , it would increase security and strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals up to the 2017 Parliament election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit range over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be subject to punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is to be improved , arms are amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult .
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession as to how the danger of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities .
to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ o ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior minister spoke clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a sla@@ p for the makers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he considers a general prohibition of full wear to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
one cannot forbi@@ d everything that is borrow@@ ed , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ q@@ ah .
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate action and action with new anti @-@ terror p@@ act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this shall change : the legislative treatment shall be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night in traffic jams when driving over the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction is extended in the area between the Hammer street and the Wes@@ er Straße descent to the right @-@ hand lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then turn right from the Hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early on , which improves the overall flow of traffic on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Mu@@ enster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerve trains drivers between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the traffic jam reaches up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here traffic is only accessible via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to be able to record the heavy load in two lanes .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the inter@@ connected con@@ ges@@ tion will last , the local authorities cannot say .
however , it is to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official residual duration until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legislative authority , the state company deliberately chose the more traffic @-@ reducing time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities .
traffic is performed on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima &apos; s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Forest School Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima , 19 students between 11 and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the goal for the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project .
most of the students of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language transfer are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvements
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night for Friday a das@@ h through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was poor@@ ly suited for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
rest@@ ful night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning is already far in front of the alarm @-@ ring@@ ing no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ evil , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Research and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore an in@@ fusion and sleep @-@ disorder , is what is meant for the time being .
it is precisely the sl@@ um@@ ber that many people feel as un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board of the German GP association with practice in Var@@ el Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can contain organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often very common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ evil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pon@@ der over everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , does not hesitate to go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment may appear quite different : it is supp@@ ressed , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to allevi@@ ate sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleeping pills only occur in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly a resident nurse in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first turn to the family doctor , he advis@@ es .
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for example , in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise , for example , snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of abnormal wear@@ iness , in sleep transform@@ ers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ etze says .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ acking , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling depic@@ ts the sleeping end .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep .
it counts on : regular sleep and stopping times , don &apos;t sleep long in bed , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ ser expressed himself via Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first took gold at the World Championships in Doh@@ a for the first time and at the same time presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ et via Facebook has protected himself from his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in the criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion gets € 20,000 bonus and a jungle king 15@@ 0.000 € shouldn &apos;t be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming sport is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that do a great deal and don &apos;t even see or operate in dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , he would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be maintained with countries .
&quot; if you cannot control a certain amount of time before the World Cup / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not participate , &quot; says the election Hamburger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : Ban@@ de fixed by Bag@@ gage
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
at the time of Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years of age .
the Tat@@ susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage posts as a gang .
against 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf recognised a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past anti @-@ theft schemes .
since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several crimes and had a common , work@@ able and especially professional approach .
the specialists of the Department of Criminal Inves@@ tigation 34 can demonstrate four actions specifically for the crimes committed in Germany .
in total , they had exploited more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a couple of lin@@ den trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not look like this , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a fres@@ ch@@ ered kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , is preferred over the last few weeks , however , preferably with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has voted against the project several times for a hard action by the police , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Ka@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ ro@@ uted the police for three weeks according to official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on site , blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers pulled down under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves before sp@@ lashing .
there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who holds three children here , are above all gener@@ alised by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects they divide the care of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ ent left .
evi@@ dently the tren@@ ch that the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between house owners and their neighbours do not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which also today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been under great police force in a real street fight , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and ball@@ ads from all over the world over the past few years : residents from East Germany and former home owners share their neighbourhood with them .
this is also reflected in the rent that has risen almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them in raised disks or freshly cut facades , which were thrown with color @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often as the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Left @-@ Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbors can see that as a problem might be that they are not necessarily imp@@ acted by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as physical injury do , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are made up of damage , which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for acts of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined to do so .
even the famous fire @-@ burning cars are no longer present in the ri@@ gs anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architecture , their street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately pulled into Riga &apos;s street - and remained .
that &apos;s why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the interpretation of interpretation over the district in July .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street continues to be taken away from them : fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is , in the end , con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - here people who are not so well equipped are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should be done if someone never hears ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are anno@@ yed about color bom@@ b@@ ings : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
anyone who draws near should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area that can complain badly about noise .
all persons presented with first names are asked not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group Refu@@ ge@@ es , administration , authorities and whoever else still ming@@ les .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there now , the ei@@ ving wo@@ olen Gardens which , above all , have a problem .
thus some - less mo@@ cking than rather target@@ ing the multitude of task areas - meant when the administration wanted to leave the place .
an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people was sought , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an en@@ viable lust for lust .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been involved for about six weeks .
she has a 50 percent job for a period of three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports both honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon New Contain@@ ers stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility shifts from the Office Office to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work so far , so that one needs to rely on private dwell@@ ings , &quot; Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
therefore , community apartments must be intim@@ id@@ ated , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing line .
but only with dwell@@ ings it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ et@@ ected or furnished .
&quot; more seats would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine reports .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do non@@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer .
people would need to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here administration and volunteers jump here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anybody in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problems also , says client hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing is possible . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fears of radic@@ alisation after recent events , even in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine tells us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would completely re@@ vo@@ ke them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary members must look out for activities on the spot and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly is the policy .
actually , it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy integrating the people so far .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
