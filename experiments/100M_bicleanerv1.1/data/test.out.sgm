<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the Sports Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of diversion with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted at home in a quick gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this speed, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led with his family through the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swung for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the context of a small gala, German sports aid handed over the golden sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the likable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, champions-tour-player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already blamed him.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talents for decades.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's both Clinton and Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidents are undivided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate it to death," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be completely different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively return regulations, and he is making a strong contribution to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">On the other hand, Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "let us invest in them, say Trump and Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be some internal discussions at Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and re-launch coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction is also to be possible in so far protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "with its investment program Clinton, on the other hand, intends to explicitly increase renewables and demand:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rend, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics say that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is at most one year old.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich's north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs organized the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="24">In women there are other reasons for the flight: "many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor morals, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>

<seg id="30">Whoever believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, recounts Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused in the worst case.</seg>

<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District Governments are responsible for the placing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">To the question whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing in the Oberpfalz region and Upper Franconia in accommodations of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Schwaben, even fleeing women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman for the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are stories in some community shelters or their own houses for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves their hands and proclaiming an official end to the eight-month long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed tasted and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his receding circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have behaved so as if something bad would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's bright, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was acute.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin dealt with and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, because it was done by a supposed boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the veto will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all.</seg>
<seg id="21">The allegations of senior officials feared that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin had received the excuse from President Erdogan to listen to.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends he can get after he was relieved of his office last month at a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti says:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes are long here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">This includes continuing resentment on the snail stamp of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relations between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state chief won in Ankara a bonus that after the attempted coup d'etat he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as an analyst once described to portray "the alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel bad and badly treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents were saying that they had not even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasise them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian President urges Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of the closest confidence circuit of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is said that without stating reasons," "" "President Ivanovs ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Deputy Chairman since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he later was the clerk and chief executive of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it's the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and to leave Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">See the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secret.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was, for a long time, one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidantes and works as he did for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridiculing of the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are referenced on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust this job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another supportive ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensslut crossings with the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "deck blower" "" "approaching completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensome crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, nearly 79% of the total deck-deck is in their place and the last section of the deck is today in Rosyth a concrete deck for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first shutter is a major milestone for every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project is the closure of the trend-setting high and low-end construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate, because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and Greens say: investors should be taken into duty in the future much more." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD is proposing a" "" "living space" "" "for the next session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we are in agreement with the Greens:" "" "if you want to build on urban areas, it will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the great controversy in the town hall is," "" "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private grounds?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as little as 20 percent of the housing as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "a new municipal housing development program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, will provide incentives for incentives." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, said Bratmann:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions at the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants to be hardening constraints for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as Bratmann, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not yet fully stand: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one deal with the loss of another approximately 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will run out over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be bought out of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social dwellings in the western city is drastically increased, it is removed from the aim of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there to be any movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "s & D Group president Holger Hershschke says:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This has concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness which is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created first for video games in the 1990s (later a series of cartoons, playing cards and other spin-offs originated from it).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the servers overload.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, they can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when it was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the U.S., the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person restores every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people, who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to take "30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are mamish gamblers, who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could go against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, more fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is on all this immune.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American designer klomm on Thursday for a multi-campaign title and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and final Five team player Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simone Biles contests the women during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title, and overall the fifth while she has established her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport for the last three years, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited them a final exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between their and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in each of the women's individual multi-combat activities at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted that during their long journey to the top, never planned the future, that is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion to the gymnasium in which Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost a multi-fight competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa led through two turns, the picture blurred.</seg>
<seg id="27">Float beams and floor urns - where Biles holds the world champion title - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again at 15.433 on the brimbeam - and with a 15,933 on the ground still sat on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her softly when she expected her end result - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old team captain, called" "" "Grandma" "" "by the Americans, had a margin." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After their ground practice they threw away kisses of the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard police spokesman Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," "" "said Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month." ""</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to their injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present at the gymnasium in the gymnasium and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, which is Catholicon, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-Americanist.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so gymnastics in the whole country do not look like that.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympics will only have four female performers in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily contribute to private gymnastics maintained by parents who pay for the training, orientation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in affluent suburbs, which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner gets their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have exercised their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer an affordable and easy-to-reach gym thanks to the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that motivates thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thanks, you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant Physicians would like to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistants who voted for a vote rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS had been found in a "No Man's Land" and would be detrimental to any further delay for the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants should receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend calendars in order to improve the care of unattended clock times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee for Registrains shared last night in a message with: "assistant physicians have still raised serious concerns about the proposed deal, in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and it will be fooled to do justice to all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes had to take part in the government on account of reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was done by a promise made by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt now has to act, lift up the enforced and address the concerns of assistance physicians." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors on the strip post chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekendcompensation for the 54.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, General Director of the NHS employees, asked the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Mortimer said:" "" "work campaigns reach nothing of just a little, but strain already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients, nurses and their families only worries, need and interruption." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">During the last two months, we talked to the assistant of the assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblower with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of curriculum, training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers, the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health were concerned with regard to the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulating drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the topping breaks apart, it can cause blood clots that clogged the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clot loosens, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>
<seg id="13">The NICE approach published today recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE health technology evaluation centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year at the dismissal of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of electors from religious scenes would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up barrier tapes outside of electoral districts to protect intimidated voters.</seg>

<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court decided that the incumbent mayor of Luton should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way," and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman was said to have led "his campaign on the ground that it was the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation where one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>

<seg id="20">In his report it is said: "as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose, in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or bangish background.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright chaps his tongue to the dirtiest places of Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underlined his immune system and sausage lex for serious testing by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shirked his train on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a pulling button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dropping any object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of detecting the purge of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left nothing to leak, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the restitution of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public transport to railway stations to flushing knobs of toilets, the task set his immune system definitively among a rehearsal</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film, he said:" "" "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial line showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet which he refused to refuse after her Luminometer scale was over 4000 units, whereas freshly washed hands have less than 60 hands</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more suspicious than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorings, who ended up saying" "" "Call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the bustling Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to them, danced them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 per cent said they are at least occasionally using products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asoziale family left their social indwelling after a delogization with a pound of £50,000, because it terrorized their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltwash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, the housing cooperative found shocking property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were perforated, wooden planks were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have been resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for housekeeping at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said the terror that the family had joined, street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation by residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strifes and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an order for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under circumstances, old trash was found.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, wooden boards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight on the street and police had to be invoked on a regular basis</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing organised her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily undress.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Delogiants were cheered by lightened neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They didn't care about anyone." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, testified that the family would have agreed to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house waste and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant would agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their families, as delogification is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house.</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found more than 70g of cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon got a fine, after she had been guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graffiti coated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will navigate the tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid as up to now it's not possible: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the combatants, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there are practical problems: during the vacations, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes at the end of the day, only to budge up with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the last day of the election and the last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let itself pass through a campaign of elections close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionism.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive electoral campaign, seen from his grand posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chat a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor, Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "otherwise, seering has got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel the blame for the bloom of the AfD." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create that" "" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the right office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time one makes electoral campaigns at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Angela Merkel has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations. Angela Merkel is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "lamented Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is a pity not to listen to Angela Merkel once again from other corners of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, says Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noticed that in the country, it is crumbling the base that it must very strict to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>

<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU elector coke on his comrades is also self-revealing:" "" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, Every Birthday celebration must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to become a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats were ultimately 22 percent behind CDU (25) and only slightly ahead of AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD won still clearly at 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, the small party with seven percent in polls, are likely to make the leap into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays and spend their election campaign largely on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign" "", "calls it the chairman of the country Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green campaigners go on a search for trace-search for local voters under the vacationers.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30am in the morning and end only at 8 o'clock in the morning, there are everywhere praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they all made it pretty shaky," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was relocated to the south by the end of October until the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is also commended with the receipt of those responsible for the construction works, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift trips.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg will be resumed, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now return from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The credential traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were sometimes considerable complaints," says Florian King, responsible for the rehabilitation management of the rehabilitation project.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to a franchise of some trucks in residential areas?</seg>
<seg id="15">Since speed limitings were not complied with, the municipality increasingly called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant exaggerations," says King, who made himself informed about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been heated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way at 77 mph (77 mph) in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that the street is open for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27-refurbishment has led to sales collapses can be seen through every one you ask.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "i.e. for other companies, have hardly any consequences for this." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also talks about a" "" "maximum slight decline" "" "at the dealership Maier as well, but also admits that of course," "" "the impetus is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local spots along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all guest houses have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the revenue losses are reduced to" "" "well over 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the road refurbishment has" "" "thrown back" "" "its operation" "" "by two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages that arise through the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows about other administrative districts, where so much more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regulars are now less frequent because of complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't get around it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will come back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="14">Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière starts a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "the CDU-man concedes." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still believes this to be reasonable and also doesn't demand anything that the coalition partner has no chances anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are also being presented by de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more opportunities to detach people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country will have to check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In case of denial for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many things also still seem to be poured out and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of patient ones for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière says that it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to say that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the face of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply occupied allowed themselves to be excluded even during election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved immensely into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Just the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are electoral campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD are therefore increasingly taking their position in the issue of inner security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, the two parties went up high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a long-standing dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the Ressorchiefs also demand a Burka ban and a reversal of dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't hold anything from a single pass away from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To reopen it is not useful.</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite the diesel prices, the delivery numbers are rising worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But it is not in all markets.</seg>

<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the lack of diesel, Europe's biggest car manufacturer continues to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July, the Volkswagen brand was weakening mainly in Western Europe and thus burdened its overall sales, such as the company listed in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1,449100 cars in July with 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China alone, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's level.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the German home market, shipments bagged almost one hundredth.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the USA, where the abatement of the abatement was first escalated, a minus sign is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is further glimmering further by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months there is only an extradition minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales Fred Kappler was able to present a further sale from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust test.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles for retrofitting into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the conversion, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After upgrading the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">After upgrading the car, the car manufacturer will issue a "guaranteed" certificate, but don't talk about a "guarantee" as it was said on Friday in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason are legal fines.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Focus" "" "reported that Volkswagen now gives its German customers a guarantee for retrofitted diesel models." ""</seg>

<seg id="29">"deviations from this are not accepted," explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.</seg>

<seg id="31">Volkswagen themselves does not use the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the long term "warranty," Volkswagen clearly sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after retrofitting - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in customer interest it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the scandal, as it was said to be unsecured with regard to possible warranty regulations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged men love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before committing to the comment section, you can restrain him under the pseudonym "Non-Allee Councillors" of the Middle Ages with harsh insults. this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the widely discussed recovery of vinyl records is not based on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news from physical objects but to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight inferior to the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with YouGov's results?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, I would follow the camera as I run in a busy street in Soho, wear a humble grey suit and stuffed wild before I stand, hold my hands and say something determinant like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which independent sellers were formerly based - there still remains a handful of fantastic sheet specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am of Sister Ray (Number of data: two middle-aged men, three middle aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and re-selling items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets will apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media puppy, people who have heard about their comeback and set themselves to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually got rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of followers of the plate-revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to see that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers offended the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects that evoke happy memories of youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be a feeling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flutes from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month did not yet listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I go through a pile of Bossa novels.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of people: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here and said:" I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record, so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mop, which has dedicated nearly a whole floor to the records, has a lower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest Synthesizer- and sexbepacketed Pop instead of experimental jazz dries from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but bad mental trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping as a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I appear to bolster the pants pants pants, I watch a group of young age girls grouping themselves together for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "disk art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although my investigations yielded that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record shops in Soho, are unaccounted for by the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with security strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who dominates nothing of middle-aged men's shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="1">French Court rejects proposals on demolition of businesses in the jungle of refugee camps</seg>
<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary stores in which people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to ergydrinks, sell, barber services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and health risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in public and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the" "" "closure" "" "would be a disaster for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The Migrants' Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimates on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number by now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives: in various federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightening devices will be tested, which should be superseded particularly effectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic reinforcement Trailer from the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accident points where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed limit there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there is a stationary glitter to comply with speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile construction can however be too dangerous or cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery holds five days for continuous measuring operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be detected at the same time over several tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as driving bans according to time, distance and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-year Rugby reached a sudden stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis in the final on Thursday night, when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the bottling stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji passed a master class in handling, side-Stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was defeated by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of it Fiji could have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and let the attacks explode out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one were running in driving buses. the World Series winners left 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was beating in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly grasped the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hepy Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jasa Veremalua went down a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new member since the replay and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou hit the UK team's weak tacklings and stormed until the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still gutted.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova was going through after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South Sea sultry, whose fans sang, flags swung and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire Fijis's playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliam put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whiff sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB wiped out crushing in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on that day, Fiji Japan defeated in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain urged South Africa in a tight semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by combat with the cancer of the trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than these games and that will mean what.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard hieve who enter into history Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed for the second Olympic gold in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport that set such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39.ter unwritten commitment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and there was no one more instrumental than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operating and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a very bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even greater challenge.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-raising morning to talk more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. this may be something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">During the last five years Helena Glover and Heather Stanning won no race.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "remain in the process, stay in the process."</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was a member of the association for 31 years, stands for 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veirstein group with its headquarters in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, transports approx. 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchberg, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are available for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current president, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a watermark in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the elevated tanks (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no downtimes and I have always added new things because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he really lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veirstein group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Franconia District.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his turn, praised the water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful pop-up.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>

<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the tubing in the elevated tank near Kirchberg on January 3rd.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the towns could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">The supply of new brunn can be maintained only once, because the high reservoir of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity extraction are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energy envelope in the existing systems of the so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said to WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that the status quo of the previous arrangement will be widely ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "with regard to our steel campaign" "" "Steel is the Future" "", "this is a first step." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "also in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets must be weighed down," "" "explained IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a substantial price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened further, when China's world's largest producer of manufactures fell heavily on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European producers have given price dumping to Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation is somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have an impact on imports; on the other hand, economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the end ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the produced quantity left behind each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp had already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl, she was in the school choir. in the course of studies she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in an elderly choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall vivid, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German Senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular cooperation, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures break up at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a chorus is a very special form of togetherness." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, meaning Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">In doing so, senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs regularly will not get out of the puff as soon as possible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Older people often have a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people wakes a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lyrics and especially melodies slow down even people with dementia in long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of singing, a special power is required to the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating simultaneously on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting itself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live on their own are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The feeling of self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for something long, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, Seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior fennel, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also provide overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the Church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many elderly choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="18">It is too early to manifest itself to possible causes, but probably it is the acts of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs have been bombed by opponents of the ruling junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities would have received intelligence on the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed of the exact time and locations.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police reported to their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always small bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the new bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending its homepage to follow the instructions given by Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between the security forces and the Muslim population, not necessary trips to these provinces will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos, while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, reaffirms itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not manage to get a grip on the revolving rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop on a popular Hindu-Shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old nevertheless take part in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received special startrights from the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more known in underrepresented countries.</seg>

<seg id="16">On the basis of a "prosperity bar," the English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made it funny about him.</seg>

<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">The running of Eric Moussambani caused media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">The swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable, when he had to compete on his own in a forenoon of more than 100 metres.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was frenetically cheered at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an overriding calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the Office of the Office of the Office of Kulmbach, it was established that undercover runs for these sewage treatment plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the village of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the plants at a cost-saving manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens, as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative manager Herbert Schmidt showed up to the Board, a re-calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undertakings from the previous calculation period will also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt thus founded the serious charge increases in all three wastewater facilities around relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the back-lying calcculation period, renovations and repair expenses were significantly reduced in all three plants due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the Azendorf waste water plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welchenahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and during the pond sewage treatment Lopp, the first sewage sludge had to be discharged after almost 20 years. the sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system was installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "for these extraordinary expenses, the continued support and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water accumulation in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance will be "fully slapped."</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market community of major maintenance costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years, has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to stone houses, the situation for these facilities will continue to be precarious in the long run, particularly as the area of the Friesenbach valley wastewater association can not be extended by these facilities because it is a lack of public facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat tells us that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, the Snapchat facility enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein's painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unblunted, self-winding tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All false entries reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the application of black face or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit-eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely circulated on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after the Snapchat announced it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an excuse: the filter was thought to be an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asian characters.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely used across the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and inconvenient."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian cartoon and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the abwerable extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolperwire.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapchats big audience of young people - who are more different than their older counterparts in terms of race - could rather expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of snapchats creates an image that insults a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to go unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial issues reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely unanswered the Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, the company refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a human resource manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu in turn said she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking democrat in the Committee, Member of the Adam B. Boat Representatives in a statement.</seg>

<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker according to government officials stated that contrary to the statements of the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these provisional refineries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger governor, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever having done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows this: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons in the first place, who are unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch, who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">However the game might go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirl through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 squares.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in his hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn matters into a better one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can completely rode the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorstep in the first half of the game with a back action from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She carried a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and plunged the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the age of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and unavoidable, a fast-paced relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the swimmer to the gymnast to triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the Coffeshop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could well be among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even flaw.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest argument for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely noticed the last 16 years that many people, I had questioned, did not know that it is at all an Olympic portability.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has some outside charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending bouncing - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring conquerors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and have to shoot a number of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are rated according to official Olympic program according to design, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but in the television transmission also another sneaky goal: the world or the Olympiarecord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen like the contest at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13: 00 pm.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and the objectification of male athletes - as the Male American Turner has recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to meet.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia launched the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia coming together right now?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people plunged into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shooting and killing unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror hazards beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold over power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies were the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions escalate along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged and controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years have been defeated more or less, could use the turmoil and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of incandescence under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians believed they were gathering so much protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics as they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are coordinating under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, accounting for about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of Ethiopia's Prime Minister until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special agents to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for reasons of relatively nontransparent reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region north of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protest against elections, seemingly bungled by the government and subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids dozens of protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last few months and this period of unrest was relatively quickly over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal grievance of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharan city, businesses run by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a unique position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin atrocity." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump states his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had not been seriously meant to be the "founder" of the Islamic State terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who endeavor to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to assert statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump recalled the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism lashes out on Mr. Trump, while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling convergence levels on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm back to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "" "Of course I meant the sarcastic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to rudder back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction falls." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his survey figures have gone further." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leadership with a big lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general is trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly in focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent intercessors, had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her back-butcher, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread out by being aggressive in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "TV experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked apologizing for Mr. Trumps as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once over the price of the market, cafe in Greenpoint returns</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a foaming café in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash that didn't have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices came from his Bedford Avenue shop front.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's business, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people lost it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is extricated and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it's also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalised Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long time employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started to work at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide money for a new branch, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are garnishes like capers and fried onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited the club regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb was closed, she gave up the coffee tines for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "I realized that there was coffee and culture in the club that I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even though on this day instead of her usual iced coffee, she ordered a blended Chai Tea, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came fourth to seven, every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and pick up new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no resentment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "I think we're going to respond to her offer," "" "said Rodriguez." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Water Turtle Soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on that day was somewhat more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Briegelman.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "their latest collaboration," "" "A decent meal" "", "published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snappy snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the market crash of 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Coe, 57, Turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter hackrame ordered this, this found the couple for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rich food was very popular," "" "said Ziegelman." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have been in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" honours the ways with which the country avoided being no longer the land of land.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense topic," "" "Coe commited, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as tense was the new buddy diet: mysterious dishes such as bread and casserole were added to staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way to reuse food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruits.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat that has been the center of American cuisine for years has become a rarely serviced luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar blends have been tried, as a rich and nutritious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">While researching the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to noon," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "Ziegelmann continues:" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - worked out the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household policemen," and the challenge to transform pampas such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historic delicacies." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-Cake food pose, are particularly tasty.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer's kitchen of his kitchen, he was eating like the million-weight man from the world to whom he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cooking like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and carried a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was really realistic to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would perhaps have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the recruiting of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt made that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting ones. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was discarded as soon as the country returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Brickman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how they could not throw away food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland hai: the oldest vertebrate-animal is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-hairs usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation, this shark was allowed to go back to the sea aboard the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This loneliness characterized by loneliness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Grönland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, the evolutionist has long argued that Greenland will be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's hairs are hard to watch, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated shores of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Scientists know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion when they outfitted six animals with one transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the basis of the ice cream and look for cadavers, which are torturing from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied now 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, with the largest 502 centimeters in size.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempt to bring large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons test, thus celebrating its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland harks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimetres should be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönland-hai-females first get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-hay with the multiplication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methylalemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Grönland wal, in whose bacon on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon peak was stuck, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often also runs on a flame-flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The mints from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage route from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next Roma transit of all the altar registrants in a period of two years, the meeting of the ministries of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally one decided for the city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the opening of the Holy Year of Mercy at the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the sanctuary, made their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and told the pilgrims' blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, there was a train to Villingen, where also a Münster-loved-loved wife stands and so the pilgrim's way was taken from the Minster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis at field crosses, chapels or churches always made a rest to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parishes of the local parishes were at their disposal for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage targets Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made a tasty and delicious dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, one stepped up the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first about 500 metres of altimeters had to be lowered and then drowned.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the evening, the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to Freiburg on the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="17">Minis was visibly relieved and happy in the afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thanks to a small impetus, God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert who arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon I went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottland Callum Skinner raced in the men team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio last evening, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. he made the legend proud when he stormed home in order to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the newcomer Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as an executioner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy wins - and Skinner made an Olympic board in the Qualification Round, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was almost back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic board in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hinder admitted that after a weak start, he fell sharply on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a superb victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said:" "" "it feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kennys, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Thomson, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a prey of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would come from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is going to take part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be defeated as a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, where the focus will be on Wiggins.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had argued with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong team of rail to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly remarkable presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama was played in the background, such as the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April in the midst of sex and bulbbing accusations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first night of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces by workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to not grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy that is set for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workplaces - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa joined Point Henry Schmelschei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea Power Plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa melted in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step is followed by years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally on the basis of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium mold with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Antonio." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the stereotypical action of almost every birthday sepsis of a children's show (Seacular brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon on a broadcasting station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris did not have to let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>

<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September edition is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that tends to resemble a photographic book rather than a fashion magazine, the edition draws a large number of advertisers (According to the 832 pages of the newspaper 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover-star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before the official announcement.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilo and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather bulky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would be sufficient today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9communicator" "" "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into shops - and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet era.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the western ash format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML-Browser, albeit agonizing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, albeit not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns's cell phone industry experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, suppliers dominate the market, all of which came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, that is for many people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces.</seg>

<seg id="3">For me this was the biggest attraction Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London when we had a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics had great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we are already 10,000 new apprentices alone, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>

<seg id="9">The two-fellers were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heathrow too.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in real growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal until the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented walkways of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London 2012 games were a great success for UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably habitable according to the projections of a new NASA air model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms resembling those of climate researches.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have reared up similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still revolved slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet would probably have more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exponentially increases its tagging side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously thought by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus -- in the course of several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect back -- the Venus, as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="7">The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was found in Chen last Sunday, which is used as a masked agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Sport CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the runs over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested an opening of the B sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full co-operation with the investigations," cited Xinhua from a message: "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news seeps through the positive rehearsal at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be food supplements," "" "explained the athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance will deal with the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B test should have already had a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately reported his criticism to the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday, the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "", "the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested as his brother Tomasz on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days before." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them dispute the intake, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, the Danekowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association, except for systematic doping, banned the launch of the entire Russian team, and the Kenyan campaign also produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, in addition, the previous violations in China caused severe disputes between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle, I want to pass over," said Lacourt in the French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was tested in 2014 with the Chinese nationals positively to the stimulant trimetazidine but had to sit down only a three month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data claw: so perfide blackmail hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes below 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 per cent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the som required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators strongly specialize in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially blackout ransom is much higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling speedy evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes's chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">At first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was very scary over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final turn code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is incurred when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses through ransomware, 13 percent had to completely undermine their business activity, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of hospital acts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always tell the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of stagnation in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure tested the user interface and contact with blackmailers and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims by chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or unlock for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed by payments of only a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, says Safety expert Chester Wisniewski of anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software build box to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware-kits used to date were created by buying malware, counseling and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a fitting tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for other hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is per infected calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then engage spammers with dissemination," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes polls survey rely on the ability to ward off Ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is no longer a threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are instead threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes's chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could have completely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could control a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage space.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kinosettle and offer storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the floor to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort." ""</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulator reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed as required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this shall change: the legislative treatment shall be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night in traffic jams when driving over the motorway from Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), road construction is extended in the area between the Hammer street and the Weser Straße descent to the right-hand lane by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then turn right from the Hammer street to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic divides early on, which improves the overall flow of traffic on the busy section of the federal road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Muenster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder nerve trains drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the traffic jam reaches up to the bridge over the Albersloher way and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the needle-eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weser Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here traffic is only accessible via the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back a good three-quarter years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to be able to record the heavy load in two lanes.</seg>
<seg id="15">How long this bottleneck and the interconnected congestion will last, the local authorities cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it is to be reckoned with years: because the bridge has an official residual duration until the year 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Restful night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning is already far in front of the alarm-ringing no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weevil, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping Research and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The insomnia, therefore an infusion and sleep-disorder, is what is meant for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the slumber that many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German GP association with practice in Varel Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can contain organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often very common in depression," "" "says Weevil." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder over everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, does not hesitate to go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may appear quite different: it is suppressed, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping pills only occur in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly a resident nurse in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first turn to the family doctor, he advises.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise, for example, snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of abnormal weariness, in sleep transformers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze says.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "said Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After clacking, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling depicts the sleeping end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts on: regular sleep and stopping times, don't sleep long in bed, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is completely and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">At the time of Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Tatsuspects had committed several bags and luggage posts as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">Against 21.30, civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf recognised a gang that was known to policemen from past anti-theft schemes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since the middle of July this year, the two women and two men had committed several crimes and had a common, workable and especially professional approach.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Department of Criminal Investigation 34 can demonstrate four actions specifically for the crimes committed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they had exploited more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of linden trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this, but the police counts them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a freschered kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred over the last few weeks, however, preferably with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has voted against the project several times for a hard action by the police, the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Katerschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrouted the police for three weeks according to official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on site, blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers pulled down under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves before splashing.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a primary school and kindergartens in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who holds three children here, are above all generalised by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects they divide the care of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from vandalient left.</seg>
<seg id="16">Evidently the trench that the Berlin interior senator and the police between house owners and their neighbours do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which also today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been under great police force in a real street fight, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and ballads from all over the world over the past few years: residents from East Germany and former home owners share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rent that has risen almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them in raised disks or freshly cut facades, which were thrown with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often as the words" "" "Left-Autonomous Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbors can see that as a problem might be that they are not necessarily impacted by criminality: crimes such as physical injury do, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are made up of damage, which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for acts of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined to do so.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous fire-burning cars are no longer present in the rigs anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the studied architecture, their street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately pulled into Riga's street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the interpretation of interpretation over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away from them: faceless new buildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "this is, in the end, condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - here people who are not so well equipped are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should be done if someone never hears?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are annoyed about color bombings: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who draws near should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area that can complain badly about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees in Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group Refugees, administration, authorities and whoever else still mingles.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is there now, the eiving woolen Gardens which, above all, have a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mocking than rather targeting the multitude of task areas - meant when the administration wanted to leave the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative staff with a talent for languages and people was sought, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an enviable lust for lust.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been involved for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has a 50 percent job for a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Client that Annika Deuschle supports both honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon New Containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility shifts from the Office Office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, so that one needs to rely on private dwellings, "Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community apartments must be intimidated, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with dwellings it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be undetected or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more seats would be good," Regine reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do nonprofit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here administration and volunteers jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anybody in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems also, says client honestly, "people with whom nothing is possible." the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fears of radicalisation after recent events, even in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine tells us that" "" "some people may call naïve." "" "a residual risk could and would not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would completely revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary members must look out for activities on the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly is the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," "" "Annika Deuschle says." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the people so far.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
