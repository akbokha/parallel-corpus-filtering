Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement , as well as in T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington den@@ oun@@ ces Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama around Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu announced a controversial speech that was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election forthcoming in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor promised to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the police found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white sheet : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door of his office .
Delta State University Political Sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ er Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb has made the fatal emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty is comprised of 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in employment policy of the University meant that the doctorate , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls mol@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had obviously been together some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was al@@ right .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had friends and had a daughter who was now 19 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met Lamb , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter is writing and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mou@@ th@@ piece game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the ti@@ dy and jo@@ king with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of the Brotherhood and the student committee .
at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening some 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community participated in a candle light memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ t &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l watch , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two ever married .
toys R Us plans to hire less labor for the holiday season

while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film starts and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and a length of length from being on a date with the princess of Wales .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief declares that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five years of ongoing conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in overcoming the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 surveys that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in poll@@ s down , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means to the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate che@@ ater .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claimed that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given leadership to the rising generation of Cain , of which none of them even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and starting to let their dollar flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey data indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey from Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with dump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same via Tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; when J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they impose their money @-@ hat@@ s , republi@@ can voters consider Tr@@ ump to be real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of the ten end of July their money put on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is clear that a variety of GO@@ P voters look at Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathering another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey from Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has scored 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a close majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say that they have made their mind .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly given their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say to never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common to Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans tell them that they agree with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , immigration was the pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the new @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / post pol@@ l from Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with ump in issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son have meanwhile accounted for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans speak in the new Mon@@ days @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington as well .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Registry / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated about the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fer@@ nal . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Hob@@ by@@ en route - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a roof hom@@ est@@ ead costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student boy in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well marked .
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky strike by Thomas Müller led the FC Bayern to a well @-@ deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Pir@@ äus , then it was running .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have given FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their play in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers twin pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth consecutive success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28 matches in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , Müller received a ben@@ evol@@ ent help from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ sten Roberto , who left a world champion &apos;s thought @-@ out shot as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speeches .
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent home games in the top class , among them notable clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too in@@ ventive in their offensive endeav@@ ors .
the attacks were often initiated by shifting the game to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ so was hit .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown sur@@ rendered the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct pick up , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus moved con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ fers .
on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was not allowed .
for example , when he was directing a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola had a four @-@ chain meeting with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup leader gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Chief Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something else out of it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an to the defeated Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , Müller put another on top of it by El@@ f@@ Meter .
in front of the game , it was ra@@ ging in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly black@@ ened Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently provoked the adher@@ ents of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and presented with sticks against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : without reno@@ unc@@ ing , the risk sin@@ ks rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth to increase 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times .
the scientists had watched over 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to smo@@ kers more frequently .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk , but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could , however , take more than ten years to return to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , explained author Thomas Dietrich of Birmingham University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one has to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , director H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and containers and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to the age of old .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected by DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking will increase the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across Cologne &apos;s bank on rem@@ n@@ ants from L@@ ate Anti@@ quity
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine for the repeated time .
close to the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings , said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
histori@@ ans have been looking for so @-@ called ground monuments since the start of construction works on the Rhine .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department of archaeological preservation .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found five .
it was already known from text documents that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had been a church , Trier said .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
accordingly , the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its operation corresponds considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be derived from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time , a second instance is fores@@ een .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators , and there was no obj@@ ection to their judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion over the past months it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work for an international investment tri@@ bunal in accordance with its own specifications .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially requested by major corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary to over@@ ride the damages of tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or impose a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act designated the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they are not supposed to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission included key points in the reform of the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European corporate association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US until now .
originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is regarded as no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the sh@@ y@@ ly acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells from various places he always records on the map , what his meticul@@ ous and tender arranged songs tell .
where they originated and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be wonderfully creative .
published in 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; are clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can drift into opul@@ ent opul@@ ence at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be con@@ ferred . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the New York living musician returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a highly acclaimed masterpiece is published in 2005 .
brilli@@ antly based on ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and lacks an annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic off@@ cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth neat studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark Hamburg more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to intim@@ acy and folk .
without judging the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core thank@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows down under ro@@ aring applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut on the prime minister &apos;s question of tension is anticipated with tension
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; D and join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to post the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s spokesperson said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; irrespective of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the BBC &apos;s political correspon@@ dent Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within the UK , following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has proposed amendments to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the £ 26@@ ,000 limit to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who has been managing David Cameron since he is a T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 inspir@@ ations .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from losing both &quot; skill &quot; and stri@@ fe with re@@ vocation and instead concentr@@ ating on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic prime minister , is represented if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the move abroad .
he has also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; punch and punch theatre , &quot; often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later , he admitted he failed .
since it was initially broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und goes through accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound rose sharply according to data that indicate an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller bid goal .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage had been the fastest and raised estimates at the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index has increased by 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v entered .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
according to encouraging news from the competi@@ tor company for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by selling stock as part of his strategy of reducing debt .
the shares in the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages would je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill states that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his company , he says .
the costs could hit J@@ D Sports &apos;s expansion plans , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
O@@ pp@@ ie 21 years young , a hand@@ ing with an upper @-@ lay@@ ered flag .
the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros difficult .
rather more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied the Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
but since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber Building : here you will live I@@ dol , whose poster is attached to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much on the day as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory school attendance ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bie@@ ber himself does not .
this has already taken care of it anyway .
for the advertisement in the promotional period of the Super@@ market , he collected three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company paid many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Ben@@ ber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you are astonished at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million people .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others emphasize that Bie@@ ber ultimately is in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; on No@@ .1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least , he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Lebanese to the idea of potato twe@@ eter
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it is both - and in the potato twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger it@@ burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the words &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he accidentally saw on TV .
since then , in his shop , a barbecue is spinning , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the Lebanese had meanwhile registered the idea for the patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as utility model according to the authorities .
how much meat and how much potatoes contain the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ cash launches campaign to fight al@@ ti@@ ary attack
met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA stores strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day .
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia constitute almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed costs basis could cost around 13 million US $ gain before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , managing director Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business lunch in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , the market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s food and food trade , which has been supplied by approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction despite pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler with@@ drew and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to address sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop renovation programmes are going to grow at El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profits for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ab@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Hak@@ kas and ear@@ ns more praise than criticism for his own behavior according to the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; came into the spotlight through the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
soon afterwards , in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ab@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee . Har@@ rison called out : &quot; W@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was most recently watched as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp th@@ war@@ ted a potential U.S. Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ aly defended Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty en@@ cum@@ ber@@ ed about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted a little into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp into the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even in the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s working hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision by not taking into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z &apos;s important preliminary decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants drow@@ ned in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land between the two control points of the countries and settled down there for an unknown time .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants sc@@ aled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cry insul@@ ts against the Hungarian Ci@@ vic Police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a meeting in Brussels on no common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the out@@ dated Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country - after a fence at the Serbian border ended .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia become a crime . these laws also place higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parliament still has to agree on the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught up 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian civil servants also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process human data and squee@@ ze a crowd to crowd there .
about 20 succeeded in coming in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton keeps a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say their opinion determines which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored a number of profits .
Clinton has a broad margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support in men has decreased dramatically , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over the elderly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ encies of the prim@@ aries nation@@ ally say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top edge candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman &apos;s president becomes ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice president raises a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den does not decide on the nom@@ ination of democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bi@@ ds are by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly , as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or candidate for these sel@@ ectors of the prim@@ aries stands out unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important tra@@ its in elec@@ ting the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server are still being provided as Secretary of State during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views overall .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is happy .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have deterior@@ ated from Clinton .
although Clinton is seen by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in all : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights nation@@ ally also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump are receiving good marks .
of the six candidates tested Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many don &apos;t think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey will be dropped on both candidates , and others will lose support dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and that Tr@@ ump sur@@ passed Republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell to the lowest level , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio sits at the third place at 6 % .
the margin of error during the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in poll@@ s - with 19 % support from Republi@@ cans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign presentation in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with death of a Bar@@ uch College New
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five individuals are filed .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , informed the police .
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and supposed to wait an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms , and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the Brotherhood &apos;s national president for advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide and set aside the common good of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt strength injuries to the head , trunk and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student died since 1970 each year on the ch@@ ic@@ ane , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ then &apos;s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a indictment for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with religious attacks and the formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - this sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College prohibited the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rise in interest will come , and the house will be shaking , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance about the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank emphas@@ ised so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a trend that assets increases from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after the interest rate increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is usually upward - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increases cycle and the return on rate begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a interest rise in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and forecast only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market players made a net interest in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week ending on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all mining cycles between 1950 and today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing imp@@ etus in GDP and placed in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks if they change their strategic course .
when bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / lowering occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the scor@@ ing cycle , the managers immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to the return of returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; high interest loans often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher returns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is interesting is Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , earnings curve is flat , credit margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all tra@@ its of the market when the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy .
companies that handle the larger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit when interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have out@@ performed average 5 percentage points on average after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers could see gains from higher income , even if experts in different opinions are , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &apos; member of the parliament critic@@ ised the sender for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also participated in the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that he does something that private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ ca@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer differenti@@ ate from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also participated in the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn anything about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work has to be done to engage the public as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport to kick the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory Euro MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts a series of entertainment for the next time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the records began in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
however , experts say that there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall expenditure for August showed the lowest rise in growth since the record starts in 2000 , with only five per cent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began working with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now that is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases prior to this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites over@@ threw .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that of 5 £ an expenditure was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in fashion labels in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia particip@@ ates in the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the way to respect their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession went over to the holy place , where only days before had a building kr@@ an on the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king talked about the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded , imposed a sanc@@ tion .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was rolling down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to go to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stand when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree released by the state &apos;s Saudi Press Agency stated that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was banned from abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man praised what caused the fall of the Cran@@ e , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the great mos@@ que where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mo@@ ose as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an abor@@ ted son , which was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every sound Muslims .
officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million gi@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss reports that the time of cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
British employ increasingly cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has sur@@ ged
this results in 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores target@@ ing arti@@ sans
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q will close sales outlets throughout the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their home
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , nowadays you seem to belong to a minority .
because Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , according to the company &apos;s head behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now out@@ dated .
this is why King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at arti@@ sans and to close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are hit by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a drop in half @-@ year earnings and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing trades .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the regional court of K@@ lagen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob have been responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dispens@@ ation .
the def@@ end@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary examination , the accused decided that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the def@@ end@@ ants had money from the club accounts they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial losses .
this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in the event of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was created to the association .
the sports officials had only charged expenses for expenses and the sports club for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( about 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we were faced with the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread @-@ based chief inspec@@ tor of the financial office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , it is only allowed to make no debts .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the payout of expense reimbur@@ sement was decided retro@@ actively by 1991 .
therefore one has paid off some of the expense damages only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus has been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed deviations seemed to be explained , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and pass@@ books jointly managed the two def@@ end@@ ants , said the second accused .
why withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial reinforcement , it was important to only have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigations into account of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
that had been appropri@@ ations , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account entered the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer this question for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never paid a cent salary , he only calculated mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
at Di@@ ets , he was charged 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to demonstrate accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
the second accused was also covered by o@@ dom@@ es .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , and from his place of residence he had to drive to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on September 23 with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts running over the last three years , the machine will reduce further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions at the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) are no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs of 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the three @-@ year ongoing reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP had around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard stock accounted for 2.3 percent .
the Group , which is grown with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led together in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services were the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo recently .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues were then returned in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a split and massive positions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more shops online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the disman@@ tling of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would predominantly result in rejection : 54 per cent said , on the other hand , 35 per cent said appro@@ v@@ ingly .
61 per cent of other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
on the other hand , 24 percent are involved in interven@@ ing in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cooperation with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad is 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed , 20 percent would be responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the trade fair focuses on connected cars , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility until 27 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility Connec@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday officially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the broad public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA car association count with about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ violence at the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part in the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ laun@@ chers against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water @-@ thro@@ b was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles after the police officers .
the officials initially started to spray pep@@ per@@ mint .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now pulled a little back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press secretary of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank comes together two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half believed that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and will hold interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of money , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rough outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 PM CE@@ T on Thursday
death shiel@@ ds at Delta State University left ap@@ ology letter
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency headquarters that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police took the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note Lamb sailed 300 miles to the Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities told on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married about seven years ago as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ er had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he won &apos;t go to prison . &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life @-@ law gives on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
the Group restructuring will cost the workplace 150 of the approximately 1,000 executives around the world .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to contribute to a contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday .
in future Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business .
the cheap airlines &quot; Eu@@ row@@ ings &quot; should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future , Managing Director Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of collective agreement with the pilot @-@ union cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ controlled strike on this Thursday .
they shared the union with them .
the topic of talks should be the retirement plan for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to come to sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes .
in addition to the transitional provision of the pilot , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept .
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is target@@ ing routes to the company &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester United Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this will make the left outside defender to cry and close him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg score and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was lucky to be able to escape a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ teen .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back stronger . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w when it comes to PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ enders has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he feels very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ ables of Dr. Se@@ uss , appeared in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ camp &apos;s website , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to be a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead re@@ stores a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads man . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he succ@@ eeds in being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is un@@ familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , thri@@ ving Once @-@ lers , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a hum@@ ming , sle@@ v@@ ety Being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to rep@@ el Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test serial defeat on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
this related news : Adam Ly@@ th dies off the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully , if he hopefully kno@@ cks further down for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick was given nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first set up Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I highly recommend .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to cook mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowl and get four qui@@ cks , showed up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s full of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ que did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ eds immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dee , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring along a wealth of experiences , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ins team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .

David Cameron &apos;s un@@ equ@@ alled ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold the UK in the EU will come into trouble every day , even without the choice of genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently cont@@ ested for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states are so deeply mired in various crises as the EU is now and not always on their own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive changes of contract that they usually do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants an outside Britain looking outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the over @-@ the @-@ over @-@ long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking forward to re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may not intentionally plan any helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process is suspected of my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UK has won nothing of value from ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can &apos;t remember Boris Johnson , the First @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made himself a name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ an &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ er@@ ous foreigners and the Pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who possess most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , for Bla@@ ir had put the principle behind the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly rap@@ es@@ eed on my back on Monday - I told him he didn &apos;t need time to waste time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional bl@@ acks tendency and wild bo@@ ilers of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ev@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and TV this week , when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried on television to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - wasn &apos;t what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor did J@@ C tell his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their convention on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even touched me - news discipline stays important around the clock in the age of TV , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right not to give Cameron any free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in particular , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a decision analysis model ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to make their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors were previously informed by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed references from BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding it is supposed to have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the tobacco steering of P@@ he also took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ antly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serving as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims have been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers than the tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die in a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by giving clear evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should abandon the East@@ ern@@ er , says former Head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ender and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for public @-@ law programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial lines of time against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House Communications Committee during his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to hold the radio fee , which I do not consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least give its production to programs that others do not do or put on order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax fund financed , which could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both private productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I need to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ ed@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ ender should sell .
Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they carry out their tasks , and they can argue if they go on their apparent missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the radio fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think , we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also announced ahead of the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review , educ@@ ate , and maintain their Rei@@ ch@@ thi@@ an mission . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain &quot; public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and deal with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&quot; son@@ o@@ genetic &quot; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
other Top@@ ics : researchers read and write Brain Activity with Light
the researchers said the worms show the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep @-@ brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that sub@@ mits electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ az@@ ani made sure that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves function on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ az@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Sizegenetics , a ground breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pulses of light .
but Chal@@ az@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light which needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus can temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to ultrasound signal in clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the cheerful voice and carto@@ on images leave no doubt that this announcement for the world &apos;s largest weapons trade fair is a milit@@ ant par@@ o@@ dy produced by Am@@ ne@@ sty International to spotlight the willingness of the British government to bol@@ ster arms to repres@@ sive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jam@@ bor@@ ee at the Ex@@ Ce@@ L Centre in London &apos;s Do@@ ck@@ lands .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen on bus stations and in the subway trains that require a second view .
&quot; important announcement : do you drive from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns to the image of a tank .
in September , a s@@ warm of weapons dealers will travel with the DL@@ R ... Customers are asked to help stop the weapons trade fair .
the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum für cruel Designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys , claimed to have &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops advertising space on the planet . &quot;

one of the par@@ o@@ dy indicators produced by the Special Pat@@ rol Group .
after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside galleries .
many artists deal with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapon bil@@ l@@ boards greet commuters in the underground .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the weapons trade fair - through a blank of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ ne@@ sty &apos;s Tom Davi@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is an advance of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons trade fair comes from within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors acc@@ entu@@ ate fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago I went to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I was anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the arrival in student residen@@ ces ranges from mil@@ dly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to say : people tell where you come from , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ age , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love or hate , because seriously guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it ste@@ ers the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people go .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meetings , but they are also places where people are dressed and wearing their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so I get the energy that I spent on interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ ability - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to chat and at the end may associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed ch@@ unks of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate who added a deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you are among the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbours if it was a matter of making drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future wife , go back and see her again and see her every day and perhaps see how she draws together all common friends ?
of course the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is more subtle than it seems .
a good place is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never take someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut down your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but do not tor@@ ches your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ trav@@ eller , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate owner Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner@@ stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the low @-@ wage slave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build better still today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will rush to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he is building terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for the people remain largely here .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a terra@@ ced house needs less space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of houses .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euro , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
guil@@ d : I have set up my project correctly .
the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ Ord@@ in@@ ance always make it especially complicated .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under consideration who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , type in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able due to the stream@@ lining of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may turn off half@@ way and this could result in a break@@ out of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula One , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto for his clearly leading Mercedes team@@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup 2nd stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .

district office seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined forces under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new focal point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses .
the social foundation runs down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seek@@ ers get information on questions such as health care insurance or services of the health and care insurance companies .
for years now , we have been setting up with our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also seldom many benefits of the insur@@ ances , because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ vic Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior center for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seeing both executives in the demographic transition .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as the Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates himself to the lon@@ el@@ iness in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a major contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 am to 12 noon .

architect Karl M@@ ang , architect of Vienna , passed away for 92 years
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ yen of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5th September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus wed@@ ded on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was stated in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna with Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .

according to his own statement , he wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not want to intellec@@ tually .
in the city center of Bremen , the meadow had just cut off the hair when he saw outside a park guard exhibiting a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wiese was rus@@ hing out of the business , insul@@ ted the police , and threw down the old fine in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether the meadow will be displayed or not .

men are beating 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a sev@@ ent@@ een year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time , the group was at the level of the ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck him with his f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose collapse and was bleeding heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed forward and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the wounded young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car anymore , the wounded man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a hammer , one acc@@ entu@@ ated the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
until now , only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second sleep@@ ing@@ place was about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
there are also may@@ ors Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller again opened the practice on October 12 , until then he invested € 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises at St Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance when the field of the field met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to go into practice in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel &apos;s field breaks and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was pleased with the husband Müller to pursue his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the clos@@ eness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also sees his own boss as an advantage .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in break@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Not@@ ologist in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in voluntary work in the DRC @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as general practitioners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers get a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 euros in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as of the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises MEP Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l about 2000 patients come into practice field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , she would have gone too .
by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s office will continue to look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is rec@@ alling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time she feels a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements laugh@@ ingly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square metre plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed me to gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also going high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum will be able to do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refusal
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow arriving refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , this interior minister , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see this in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - above all to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenian wants to cut its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any EU member must complete its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has since been meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
they are mainly Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country will be counting around 4000 refugees , Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which have previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would have re@@ directed towards Croatia , matching the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to people to suggest certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id . in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were traveling around 500 kilometers away from Macedonia &apos;s Mac@@ ed@@ onian border all night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary did , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees will now travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , still tried to calm Wednesday at a local evi@@ denti@@ al appearance in Hor@@ gos : he stopped debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently be a very high number of refugees .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area , there are still unused min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police reported that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as to questions and conversations as the volunteer workers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by spontaneously acc@@ esses the chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the proposition to &quot; approach my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet , &quot; and then go on .
again and again small discussions develop on the edge of the action , about life , the handling of dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action for the 20 year old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate on the boards is understandable , and finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to opening up the people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than the previous forecast .
analysts predicted , according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November onwards .
the company said it nevertheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company delivers solid income when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ation@@ ing employment were announced a day later than those of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for instance the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share came to 2.@@ 42 US $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve of the analysts asked by Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion US dollars .
six of the analysts asked analysts for $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in the international priority shipping , which brought revenues in its unit Express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings decreased because of higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to lift the ly@@ re for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is im@@ min@@ ent over them at the end of the reno@@ unc@@ ed , two @-@ story meeting hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from Congress : keeping U.S. occupation and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data on the economy show that it is growing soli@@ dly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to ampli@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and it is only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they are seeing , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase of interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the blow , promising that a further increase is far from .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial ran an average of 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her explanation in order to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would re@@ assure financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic advance to increase the sentence .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was sound this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of the month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Rate fell by more than 16 % in May as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , where the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence affects the complex calculation when interest should be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in decision making .
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere mention of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded con@@ fu@@ sions all around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements , which apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
co@@ ater , a legitimate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ates interest rates , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives rolled back these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market crash , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England &apos;s interest rates .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest rates because the markets are getting upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability and until that is changed I do not believe that it should ha@@ sten the time .
need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yeah , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often called Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which also sells to the general public .
yes , he is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .
the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious ornam@@ ents and Christmas decorations .
there is even a car division if you need motor oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les .
if the whole shopping you make hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you .
the bar@@ ge ( good and inexpensive ) in this store is close to the till@@ s and has different taking @-@ out options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more .
the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even cook for you on request .
a good part of the shop is part of the massive freezing department . here you will find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ al , whole du@@ cks , fish , cattle blood and g@@ all , pig natural gut , fish balls , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more .
who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals .
the wide cor@@ rid@@ ors are suitable for shopping trol@@ leys and forklift trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well frequ@@ ented , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people supporting asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still teaches with her 74 L@@ enses .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s home on D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite another lesson compared to a proper school .
Rio Grande Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric society promotes nour@@ ishment for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS is trying to inform women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar panels .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gy@@ ms building at the Bern@@ ried sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council meeting , the completed construction contract was unanim@@ ously cancelled without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to this , the Board decided , among other things , an application for a statutory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a valid plan of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; permission was given for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ centered first and roof super@@ structure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south roof together , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which is supposed to lie below ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof inclin@@ ation does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ese community generally rather restric@@ tively de@@ parts with liberation motions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is no recur@@ rent project in the construction of a gymn@@ asi@@ um : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from the promotion of school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 m large hall will now be presented to the Insp@@ ection Office for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is shown by the surprising plans of the hospital &apos;s Hospital , the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted .
however , the Supervisory Board conven@@ es a decision , and conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans are implemented , then all of the 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to work with Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change of termination by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic just since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fis@@ her &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the line from October 1st and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders at the In@@ ner Station .
for the next two years Fischer and his team are to lead both houses , if the Supervisory Board agrees to the two houses , until next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which still has 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal B@@ order , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term care for the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better things could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the Qu@@ asi parade to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief physician for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ bear@@ ers of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are required at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) .
the League leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the previous season , the Bad@@ ans moved a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and made something good there .
Jag@@ mist@@ ress with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured by shots during ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in action , as the police shared .
after a shot of a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could get to the accident was unclear at first .
the C@@ ID investig@@ ates .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , who have been missing from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz , who have been missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave up the killing of young people and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police told on Wednesday .
an 20 @-@ year @-@ old also as@@ simil@@ ated on Tuesday evening is also considered to be a suspect that the fact that the investig@@ ators admitted to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators initially met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the event of ques@@ tioning in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities in the police to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ s@@ chter on Wednesday , and investig@@ ators put a heavy burden on him .
the further investigations are intended to provide information on the immediate circumstances of the crime .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing pressures
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid residence .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built by 2020 each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result is a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er residential building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation unit .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also exhibits considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of the past few years .
Germany dispos@@ es of a housing deficit rising from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ aining Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , author of the study .
many working people therefore lived in big cities in need of flat share rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily more in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the le@@ aks in the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction again .
this way , the tax rate tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could be temporarily suspended .
in addition , according to the alliance , attractive tax depreciation opportunities are required .
the support programme for Kf@@ W refugee camps is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , at € 184 million on Monday evening , more than half of the currently available some 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia address corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no coming through anymore , as more and more refugees are choosing their way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zagreb is announc@@ ing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nevertheless the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to the Minister of the Interior , and if it is necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border shut@@ down , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik border , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that entered into force on the same day make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but it was people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the Serbian border to the neighbouring country Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees do not attack border f@@ ences .
the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any refugees coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws repe@@ ats the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a criminal off@@ ence .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted are threatened with pen@@ alties of up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
but practically no one has a prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a Hungarian view Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected waste that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
lock gri@@ lles have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording stores in the border area has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary there are only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data .
about 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were occupied with the ti@@ dy , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly hired the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ oked the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first boar@@ ded the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said we are bringing them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u to try it after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
however , the regional train was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping to establish structures in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp right now , our Chancellor has publicly backed the position of the Hungarian government in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ st@@ kreis des National@@ socialism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to make decent conditions for those seeking protection against us .
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ hard quar@@ k
Konrad , with the provision of refugees , has to do all his hands .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in the former Tra@@ is@@ kirchen placement centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the placing of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 Quar@@ ters a year .
in order to meet the number , there are still 35@@ ,000 accommodations to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already talks with the state officials .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations into the ORF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for lodging as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that lod@@ g@@ ings have to respect a certain level of the towel rack or the size of the upper duties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , is more successful in placing them , justi@@ fies Konrad with his experience .
I am an elderly gent@@ leman who does not say the truth without further ado .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic any costs as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , the own mapping search has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz demands a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center for the placing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the affected persons can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of an emergency , however , other sites are to be tested for their suitability .
the town chief critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries won &apos;t be cut off &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced on Monday the further action in the issue of refugees .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again demanded greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line has been officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in its location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which was one @-@ third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center for 60 years by the Linz AG .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta has wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now received growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around the ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a site in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large city of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been brought to the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women look into rap@@ tures when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with last certainty .
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag re@@ stores every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ emaker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called investors .
some people associate this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ups .
whether it is foreign hostile to foreign journalists , or reveals gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ ing the campaign power@@ fully .
and cut it off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term in the village of Win@@ zer@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is related to him over -@@ zig quarters .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born in Cairo , K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter filmed an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous young@@ sters , among whom also Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a grand@@ mother , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the ad@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the investors .
the success story of Tr@@ ump started in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened in the USA a local for gold dig@@ gers .
the real estate group was the first real estate group in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not receive Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner retired rather dist@@ anced the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so open @-@ minded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension fund Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned , like some k@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cin@@ emas , also in the USA arous@@ ed interest .
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have at most 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise is domin@@ ating the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in Today &apos;s assessment .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV programmes , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today reported a slight increase in rates for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today in the last few months the gap to Sunrise has closed .
in August Today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September Sunrise will have an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are al@@ right , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast has reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ cker Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e gave an average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and a full 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening by The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery un@@ veiled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , who eventually lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was kept in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three , you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the end of the game , who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house attendance made her clear last week that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly hired on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his career at N@@ FL .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a tur@@ f like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions did on Tuesday at his first strike @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a hit return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his lost catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut back then in 2007 when a passport took place in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters call for the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Au@@ x@@ sage in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there are not according to new teachers for the many new pupils : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get uph@@ eav@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land parliament of the Free Elec@@ torate conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Elec@@ toral Council .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will super@@ impose the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the Yugoslavia during the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it goes no further , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ toral Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ fer Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative tri@@ bun@@ als responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critic@@ ised the fact that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need standardised standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs on them .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber floor used , which is known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal owned by the ethnic group of T@@ ret@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kath@@ mandu this week , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ square @-@ surface .
a mix of trade , commerce and living is planned - but there are still no specific offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square metres of land in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post &apos;s youth centre .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
it is planned to use the area for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , called it from the city .
which investor does not come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already a few months ago and the building on it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table

now there are plans for a new holiday village near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized company Em@@ der Company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening .

under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP Group which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers who had come to the meeting called out the images and new details about the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , a sea bus owner and a member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus charges are coming , so that this is reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well @-@ hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google launches double donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign that aims to raise € 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
rather than letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences when she was seven years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail@@ road and bus trips , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children , and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / has been doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery study .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily obes@@ e .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical interventions , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely dis@@ semin@@ ated and 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was only one percent and , in some cases , only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater reg@@ ression in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.7 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity operations , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have am@@ assed these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is currently increasingly attrac@@ ting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
even in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tually , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and revealed that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
toxic control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ infection agents in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers will drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are supposed to have mixed dis@@ infection products with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few inj@@ ections can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , especially in small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fragran@@ ced hands disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was taken into emergency treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult legally as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the Medical Center in the Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah ple@@ aded her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl dropped by the alcohol and had pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the s@@ worn out plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; squ@@ ir@@ rel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars di@@ kes .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Cel@@ tic to fight , but the Norwegian boss swe@@ ars to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ iting from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because it makes the players better .
to stand together is so important .

Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team still has confidence in the management team to do things - but admit that the decline has to end on the playing field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son &apos;s trust in us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back on a tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to win against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ beautifully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen has had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team who won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues that won &apos;t win games this way too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is increasing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July in 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as shown by the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Bureau ( O@@ NS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disturbing the drain

why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed through the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and as often more applications are available as seats , a more mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she admitted that &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again for details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ k would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after a hum@@ id police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the c@@ anning river
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he was persu@@ ading the man of the c@@ anning river .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer attempting to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house peac@@ eke@@ eping incident in pel@@ vic ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he addressed a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate sc@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt t@@ up@@ lift test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have anything to say , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that M@@ oo@@ dy had allowed the bomb to go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department tried to spy on his cow@@ shed .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to write me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ wan , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it is personally ?
has the R@@ V@@ L cow@@ ard@@ ly behave and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it now .
but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt exploration of Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been the same yesterday evening .
it could have been the same yesterday all day , which was so .
but it had it so on the racing day as well .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the racing day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver flight

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals for claims on E@@ Q@@ s
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s coach Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ c@@ ely disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy defended his team &apos;s torch and said they were only focused on &quot; contact &quot; at Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tiques of two leading trainers in his team are confident , as it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s appearing again and again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent spoke about ring games when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques all year round . but in the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it &apos;s strange how this time and again it emerges at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team in 2010 , and Way@@ ne said he &apos;ll take care of it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no d@@ ots something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has won this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks in the final evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a damage deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and landed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants at the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the agent of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café might have been out of a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security coll@@ ectively in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c has been released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and is holding an exit blocking from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driver &apos;s House tears apart &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police reported .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident origin@@ ator broke completely apart .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage to the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros was incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep , logged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a fear that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
after his talks with the unknown person he was asked who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with that .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant used computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment against in@@ decent images of children on June 14 , last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January and did not appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
Greg@@ or S@@ im &apos;s defence lawyer asked H@@ og@@ g not to appear in the ranks of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict up to October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was included in the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment was released .
tra@@ der switches on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers were caused by fear of discovery and arrest the people more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the Inn river Inn in the country districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and dam guns to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
according to federal police information in the Munich central station , more refugees once again arrived on Wednesday at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees arrived on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm cones in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the foo@@ th@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in particular in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , still on Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom seek@@ er with arches of 60 to 90 mph .
on Friday you can see the sun again .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car showers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is mainly due to movement in the compact cars , which currently sell particularly well .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public holidays 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which are the first to count three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the major competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second version will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what is going on next to the Astra at the IAA or on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only a five @-@ door variant in a conventional and an under@@ stated sporty GT version .
at the beginning of next year , it is also a station wagon .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan de@@ posit@@ or wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger presented the front part in particular : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Apple Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants on the compact class at the IAA in the compact class , such as the f@@ ished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Justice Court Te@@ gel , who was placed in a small cell for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were only a few days locked up in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was not separated .
after that , the man who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer &apos;s instructions has been transferred to a larger cell .
his duty of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of imprisonment against the land of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Court of Justice and re@@ mitted the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prison .
thus , only in April , they said a det@@ ain@@ ee loss sentence because he was arrested naked in a cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always locked for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even at ra@@ ckets it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Minister of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied for the lack of offspring , 19 are due to drop in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what happens in Germany ?
according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , about 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ veness in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this , and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming on in Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments fall out of the rental price chain , and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest € 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
in agreement , scientists and Federal Environment Ministers agree that there will also be more tax benefits for housing investments .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation critic@@ ises .
but for the integration of refugees it is important whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich T@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ us@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the ban on working for refugees to recognise work .
while earlier there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence light that limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the lack of skilled labour - mostly the perspective of refugees should be facilit@@ ated by the fact that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge .
up to now there is no adequate supply of general and occupational language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is , in the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Royal Road to the integration of labour .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is only very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Senate Administration in Berlin .
in order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - such as by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared for classes without any knowledge of German .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ air@@ case from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk ( German Studenten@@ werk ) estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state is prohibited from asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel has now given up his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or den@@ ial do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law if they start studying .
the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to the rights of the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years so far in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this breakdown can be shortened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this financing gap must also be closed , &quot; said Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively infr@@ inge on Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact person and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in doing so , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
although Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade .
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international tre@@ aties such as the prevention of anti@@ rac@@ ism have committed Germany must become a reality in the coming years if the country should remain peaceful and use its new citizens its possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ power and capacity are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requires retailers to susp@@ end health cards immediately .
services provided could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able that so many people with the limited catalogue of services fores@@ ee the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law .
otherwise , the doctors will primarily make the language barrier possible .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are getting more informed about their disease than other patients .
interpre@@ ting costs have to be taken over not only in clinics but also in doctor &apos;s offices .
it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical centers in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are , for example , much more un@@ treated disability among refugee children , and the young people are about to raise awareness about HIV .
however , with some of the other diseases , German doctors come across from their training , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the lack of doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have developed a highly developed education system , some refugees even were doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of whom suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study by the TU Munich confirms that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong reck@@ lessness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the welfare offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for the psychological illness would usually decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production , the Circus Pro@@ bst draws back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group with fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick . w@@ ow to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my Circus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ader and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - the current management of man@@ e under this motto .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus , the family is in the blood of the gift to am@@ ate@@ urs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to easily take up .
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with a sense of intuition and ag@@ ility .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
snake People fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks also on this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t it good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to slip into the arena .
the first commandment is , good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid JU@@ MB@@ O , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst said .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all our hearts . &quot;
cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks forward to his performances from 17 to 20 September daily .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is the family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
it is also open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with him .
last month they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of Parliament that immunity is ending in parliament and once they leave parliament its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers to politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies later this year , separating the computer and printers business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and its service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP president and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a wide and expanded portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new business style , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in order to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the place of birth of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused businesses perform better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario suggests that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain at the European Championship .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd. has reported 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Ar@@ senal is that in six of eight play@@ times they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 , who have reported most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you will have to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts its champi@@ ons league season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it to have a small bre@@ ather @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favorites are to continue through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched over the past season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by far @-@ reaching hope , with its management to lead the association to its first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship @-@ Festival : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is evident , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more doub@@ t@@ ful than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that men are preventing to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality shining through interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee in telephone counsel@@ ing , I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my role for people who feel de@@ pressed and threatened by suicide has clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes into mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about phone can also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , when you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broad@@ cast@@ ed at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
Angel Di Maria celebrates Malm@@ ö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria meets on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League and helps PS@@ G to pass Malm@@ ö . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held track when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the principle stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria ran less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League de@@ pot as PS@@ G player who led the French master , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani hit a head @-@ ball@@ at in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against Swedish champion , as they do not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but rather an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected at the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he suggested why , when he entered Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but except for a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance .
instead PS@@ G sometimes abandoned itself sometimes , with some mis@@ steps and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ te alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill if he put his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a spin , which was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an was the sixth of its season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the mining @-@ giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is based in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday as part of its huge school identity plan .
Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth around CHF 1.6 billion to pay its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling raw materials prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses the demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights generated a fierce rise in the share price share in trading on early Wednesday morning at the top of the London Stock Exchange .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to destroy around a third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
the company sold the new hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and rep@@ lies President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner this evening after the two leaders have held bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese co @-@ operation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest while also President Obama and President X@@ i have the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of differences of opinion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , will probably meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns about alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented from change to FC Bayern 2008
X@@ av@@ i World and European champion has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously facing the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i just a few years ago , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three championship winners , four champi@@ ons League winners , two times champion league , twice European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing in front of the European Championship before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered office of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ man@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann received the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is today working for the German record master : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has hired Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time ran with X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds broke out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s victory at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front Afgh@@ an film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she &apos;s not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the necessity of alternative perspectives , with regard to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it during the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
Brown responded shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian strengthened himself .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ urt which is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angelo and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded with dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ re@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
when the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a country @-@ wide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color content .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still weaker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media activists who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is not clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and help assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
the competition @-@ show , which finished just the 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all the stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish in the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 @-@ foot @-@ long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Great Prize of $ 1 Million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden .. like I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten did not receive any prize money at all .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will be the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great priv@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s h@@ itting any gru@@ dge about it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad it &apos;s Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ ER@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly , they once belonged to one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American league .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb inside a slot of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American league game card slot .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad out .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon retained his early offensive support when Detroit punc@@ tured three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ bar any game , and therefore I want to go very focused into the game .
the designated tiger Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked clearly better at the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear at the end of the seventh inner ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon made his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier as a Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed friend Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy managed to survive the wall , the only man he was faced with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run break from the righ@@ th@@ man Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen gave the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe defeated a Double Play
after adding an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , the Wall made a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and posted the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed man stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by a still non @-@ moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the injury @-@ list before the game after he lack@@ ed more than a month for a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started to get rid of and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ sites sold a single to Second @-@ Bas@@ eman Ian M@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z was brought into play by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who scored a single &apos; up the middle &apos; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third player Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tiger placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE at 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not beat very well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the wor@@ ship@@ pers .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder reduction , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP will cut Daniel Mor@@ ris from the list of vulner@@ abilities to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived therein will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
according to the government pres@@ idency of Gie@@ ßen 7@@ 500 people in Hessen alone in the last ten days .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective vision &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military stake in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister for Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , and no one has been sent back to Hungary .
in Germany too , no refugees have returned to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann proposed a special summit next week to several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers will take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , in the late Tuesday evening , Merkel declared after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the prime ministers of the Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who would need protection would get this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a permanent perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was expressed in an impressive way in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania would also sail with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the planned new border fence in Hungary , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness accounts in Turkey , thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ Moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ aps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the moon mil@@ ks easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for some time that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered iron volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , which sp@@ ew water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to ren@@ ounce about a month on the offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared with .
R@@ ama lam@@ ented about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious bl@@ ess@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ go contains a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their sle@@ ek line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
this is because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - mainly su@@ c@@ rose .
yet , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. Most of all , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
people who eat the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying Mang@@ os , they should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the peel color alone doesn &apos;t say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so even green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

on Wednesday and on the night for Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n partly blows with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ iled valleys .
after fo@@ iling on Thursday morning , a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rain , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently located on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the north side of the Alps , on the night , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows on Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and specially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance in some places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ an@@ arches of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday night @-@ long hair dryer takes care of summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine slope .
here rain stops , which stops until Thursday evening .
in total , over 100 liters of rain per square meter in the next 48 hours are expected to be accounted for in the next 48 hours , this after huge rainf@@ all has already occurred in the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the fo@@ eh@@ n winds the air , and in a row , a cold front with strong , partially ev@@ ac@@ ed rain from west to east winds over Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes up strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures clearly return .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther seat
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther seat in Rome .
on Wednesday , in the presence of President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now acknowledged as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing had been requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority .
with the square it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ ine mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt that the city was then a rotten evil @-@ b@@ able .
his negative impressions were probably encouraged by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his theses against aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with magnificent images .
in the beginning there was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes gave the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible Project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles dedicated to topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ernity .
he has immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and here is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into contemporary contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
for example , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant throne ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education happened once with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to support myself again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to give art in a faster time to more value : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secre@@ tive and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewers &quot; fall into the pictures , &quot; discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its object . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not considered the Bible completely to be compreh@@ ended , but also chosen for him important , mysterious subjects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth moun@@ ds for a circuit model@@ ed : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was already finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured displacement , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
thus hill ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will go down in October , the first Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck can now share with the child and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of its help in tackl@@ ing the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , it doesn &apos;t matter me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he intends to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mr@@ s Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
soccer can and will help .
but the decisive points must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal lists also support this programme .
already this weekend the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will carry on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport Chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is going on everybody , nobody is allowed to go away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer players , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s CEO Peter Ret@@ tig compl@@ ained of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European football match against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license publishers had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will jointly provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief executive loses an eye in case of accident
according to the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , the left eye was lost due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the US he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , impot@@ ent , then drag@@ ged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully jo@@ bless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; naturally , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to stand up again when you fall down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren &apos;s replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a reserve vehicle for Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button during the weekend , just as much as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low F@@ eller in the Gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us will definitely be sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem eleven on the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change in the position of the go@@ al@@ keeper .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of tribal author Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open to whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be deployed in all Europe @-@ League games in the future .
with a high lik@@ el@@ ihood , he will also ride the second game .
the for@@ en@@ sic testimony of fellow players Re@@ us that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal is understandable for the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l : &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be technological fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner when it comes to changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; new mobility era &quot; in Frankfurt on the edge of the Frankfurt Motor Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communications .
to test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not be born on additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ internationally to raise the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees human beings as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads can only be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the German auto @-@ driving cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men and Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent only expect in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents rated by 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the United States .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis
according to the current status of the title fight , the Düsseldorf region will only hit the single one from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side is , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the se@@ ed@@ list to Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves accordingly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Fi@@ fth Five . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United got a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was hit by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis in the 20 @-@ year @-@ old te@@ amm@@ ate of Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ itz pointed to a drop in the ship .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terrible human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can &apos;t say that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the walk@@ way ) , which can be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , September 18 , it is fortunate that the designer has changed his reluc@@ tance to show his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one gets to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote the fashion story without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed complete artwork for which much effort has been spent : to fr@@ o the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers travelled to Munich for 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special highlight : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tim@@ id fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
Je@@ wel@@ ry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion niche
in the past it used to work on the long nitrogen @-@ machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make a meter .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were produced in large quantities for customers , for example to further refine them to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the pur@@ ée P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already do half of all orders .
mo@@ zz@@ ard P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there is almost no more private specialty shops and the wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the mass @-@ produced goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently to Russia and the US .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery pearl in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year we have a quality seal which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;

in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must first of all think economic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter rev@@ ital@@ ised the historic snow@@ ball point .
at some places the machine sticks small spheres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master@@ in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i .
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population alarm system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified which are not eligible for investment .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally established business environment and designs the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded enterprises and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury bor@@ der@@ line in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus supplement the consumers with a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ on .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and small children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold on the basis of the currently valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate limit values for other fish currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the proposed limits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of small fish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de defl@@ ection maneu@@ ver that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly po@@ ison@@ ous for humans , which is strongly enriched over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government is therefore cau@@ ti@@ ously warned that &quot; even small amounts can be caused especially in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury primarily reaches the environment through burning coal combustion .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants em@@ it more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide crossed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish included the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
