&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from these raw materials and individual components , combined watches and movements must meet the requirements of statutory technical control in Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the inclusion in the list for a raw material escal@@ ator is applied , which has already been used in Switzerland and has not passed the statutory technical control in Switzerland , the Swiss watch chamber can reject the recording . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) The recovery from the list of raw materials listed in the list is communicated by the associations of the watch@@ making industry of the Community or by the producer who had requested the recording prior to the Swiss C@@ lock Chamber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) If the requirements of statutory technical control cannot be fulfilled in Switzerland , the Swiss C@@ lock Chamber can demand the filing of the respective blan@@ ks from the list ; it teaches the party concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this does not agree , it can take the procedure after paragraph 3 within two months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D ) Every request to change the list according to the letter a ) , b ) and c ) shall be immediately displayed to the Joint Committee of the Swiss Watch chamber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this report , the institutes are able to consult a game of clo@@ cks or movements from a Swiss company and from a company of the community that is sufficiently representative and basically no more than 50 watches or movements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after checking these games according to the standards of legal technical control in Switzerland , the institutes compare their results and create a joint report for the Mix@@ ed Commission with their conclusions and with their potential proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement and the list attached to him will be published in the official publication organs of the contracting parties , and communicated to the watch@@ makers by the relevant professional associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supple@@ mental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort to ensure that these agreements become effective within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization is based on the initial report outlined in Article 62 of the total core material underlying this Convention in the States irrespective of its origin , and carries out this inventory based on the following reports and the results of its re@@ visions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organization ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action program specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate need for individual countries with low income whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ us@@ cent@@ age problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the aggregate contribution of the member states is bound up within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D ) E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the medium bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fis@@ cal Account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is used by the organization as administrator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special transaction account is separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ sensitive promis@@ sory notes of the member state which must be paid upon request in the currency of the entity in order to act as the administrator of the special transaction and deposit at the organisation in question .
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker taking into account the deadlines necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) E@@ ach Member State may , upon request , make payments from above @-@ mentioned dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator accepts proportion@@ ate draw on the cash or the debt to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and balance the transaction account in a reasonable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discount , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VII ) the extent , in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly re@@ payable development program , irrespective of whether it is part of the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices considered by the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of regular funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions which are generally valid for development loans granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to pay this amount , the amounts must be paid directly to the organization that it reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recei@@ pts from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ( ii ) in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries which the car@@ et@@ aker has set at the time of loan granted to be recipient of a special loan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be rejected by the administrator as soon as possible from the administrator to the member state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until full awar@@ ding of all transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the E@@ EC about the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the audit by the directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the time of the payment of the transaction loan , the super@@ visor will inform the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the transaction loans and the expenses incurred for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed accounting of the transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC shall report as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programmes funded by the special transaction account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid on the account , and the payments paid to the Member States are apparent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator up to the full issue of the special transaction account , will provide an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , and any other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization possibly agree , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be due with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement requires approval by the individual member states and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish to confirm you the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for the entry into force of 1 January 1978 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful to you , if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish to confirm the receipt of your present letter , with the following wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm your Government &apos;s consent to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States as part of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include a stand@@ by credit card with the credi@@ tors &apos; central banks , if the banks issue a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor country , namely within a total limit of EUR 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deliveries of the member countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some conditions have already been cited below that the BI@@ S would be prepared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without that a total of five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as their potential extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw cannot be made prior to exp@@ ir@@ ation of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available to the BI@@ S , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that were to be dealt with taking into account the funds of the Bank , probably three or six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applies at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the required funds on the market itself , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to the margin increased by a margin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities , for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include a stand@@ by credit card with the credi@@ tors &apos; central banks when the banks issue a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that Article 27 of the Convention concerning changes has not yet entered into force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 . agree to cancel the provisions of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 . recognize that the postpon@@ ement of the application of this Convention , intended for developing countries , can be insufficient for some developing countries five years in accordance with Article 21 paragraph 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

3 . recognize that developing countries that are currently conducting customs clearance on the basis of official fixed minimum values may require a reservation to maintain these values for a limited transition period under conditions and conditions to which the contracting parties agree to be maintained ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . recognize that developing countries , which are of opinion , may cause the revers@@ al of the order of application on request of the leader in accordance with Article 4 may cause actual difficulties to make the following reservation to Article 4 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; reserves the right to prescri@@ be that the relevant provisions of article 4 will only apply if the customs authorities apply for application of Article 5 and 6 in reverse order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the parties agree that in case of occurrence of such problems in developing countries that apply the Convention on request of these countries an investigation of this question is carried out in order to find suitable solutions ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 . agree that Article 17 acknow@@ le@@ dges that customs administr@@ ations must carry out investigations during the application of the Convention , to convince themselves of the accuracy or accuracy of information , declarations or documents issued for customs clearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also agree that the article can be used to investigate , for example , whether or not the customs in connection with a customs clearance calculation are complete and correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic , about trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I teach me to take the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations concerning the import of h@@ amm@@ el - lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - fresh or chill@@ ed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the framework of this agreement the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following yearly amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ asses weight ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or chill@@ ed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the access to the community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement on a ho@@ ech@@ st set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount specified under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import duty for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which will take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion under number 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount stated on number 2 will be set by the day of the Greek entry to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the community market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions in order that the sale of intervention states on frozen meat is not under@@ mining the sale of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb &apos;s meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs must be reconc@@ iled with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional part of world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these terms are interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantities of export lic@@ ences stipulated in this agreement are granted for the products listed under Number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export license issued by the competent authority specified by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way , that the position of a deposit for issuing the import license for the goods in question can be wai@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the competent authority in the competent authority of the Community regul@@ ates the quantities in regular intervals for export licenses ; this information may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied , and works smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the market conditions on these markets , including conditions specified for the objective under number 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned tari@@ ff numbers according to the Community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall discuss all the questions that arise in the execution of this agreement , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions of this Agreement shall apply , without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the annual volume set under number 2 is valid for the period from January 1 to January 31 , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount will be determined by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year , and will take account of the seasonal character of trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party , to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year in writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 , with regard to changes that they consider necessary for necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful to you , if you would like to inform your government about this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish to confirm the receipt of your present letter , with the following wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I teach me to take the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations concerning the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or chill@@ ed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement on a ho@@ ech@@ st set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount specified under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import duty for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which will take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion under number 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share the agreement with your government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish to share with you the consent of my government , with the content of your letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trading with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I teach myself to take on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations concerning the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are exist@@ ential after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , I honour myself to propose the following agreement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement is valid for : - fresh or chill@@ ed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in New Zealand , the assurance that the normal sales of his h@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the quantity actually executed did not exceed the amount specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aforementioned quantities are carried out in the conventional forms of supply ( frozen or chill@@ ed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community assured that New Zealand will not be prevented from using new technological developments , or maintaining its competitive position in the Community market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two contractual parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it obli@@ ges itself to protect the interests of New Zealand arising from this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement on a ho@@ ax rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new Member States join , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the amounts stated in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount stated in clause 2 is set by the day of the Greek entry to the community on 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development , which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the community market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention states on frozen meat is not under@@ mined because of the regulation of this goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the two contractual parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ lei@@ sch in the community without je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing market stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lambs must be reconc@@ iled with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional part of world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Zealand , in particular , ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export license issued by the New Zealand government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way , that the position of a deposit for issuing the import license for the goods in question can be wai@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am referring to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations concerning the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aforementioned quantities are carried out in the conventional forms of supply ( frozen or chill@@ ed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community assured that New Zealand will not be prevented from using new technological developments , or maintaining its competitive position in the Community market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two contractual parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lambs must be reconc@@ iled with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional part of world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat market of the two contractual parties and on the world market as well as the market conditions on these markets , including conditions stated for the purpose stated in clause 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish to propose to me , if your government agrees to the above , that this letter and password will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish to inform you that my government can agree to the above , and that your letter and response letter together form an agreement according to your suggestion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Austria , on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I teach me to take the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations concerning the import of h@@ amm@@ el - lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - fresh or chill@@ ed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff area 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Custom@@ s Office ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Fro@@ zen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff area 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the scope of this agreement the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following yearly amount : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay under@@ takes to ensure that the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with the usual supply forms ( frozen or chill@@ ed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to limit exhaus@@ tion to the products collected by this agreement on a ho@@ ech@@ st set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay will change the amount specified under Number 2 according to the amount of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trading with every new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import duty for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which will take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion under number 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount stated at number 2 will be fixed with the day of the Greek entry to a community of 5,@@ 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the community market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions in order that the paragraph of intervention states on frozen meat does not under@@ mine the sale of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an she@@ ep@@ skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs must be reconc@@ iled with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional part of world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these terms are interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Uruguay ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that the quantities of export lic@@ ences stipulated in this agreement are granted for the products listed under Number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export license which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the competent judge of the competent authority of the Community regul@@ ates the quantities in regular intervals for export licenses ; this information may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Austria on the other hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party , to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year in writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 , with regard to changes that they consider necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s approval with this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) Un@@ less one of the contracting parties has notified a objection to his entry into force , however , after the exp@@ iry of two years after the time exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without the same time contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary General of the Council of Europe notes the Member States of the Council of Europe , all of the States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection in terms of article 2 and the time of entry into force of this additional protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General also notices any action , notification or notification in connection with this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that it is highly desirable , if the Member States support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood group determination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas mutual support is only possible if the condition and use of these re@@ agents for the determination of the blood group is subject to the rules imposed by the Member States , and the necessary facil@@ itation and exemp@@ tions for their import are granted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this agreement , the term &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; means human , animal , plant and other origins in the determination of blood group determination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to blood group determination in the signature of this Convention , or the deposit of their rati@@ fication , approval or accession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the declaration may be withdrawn at any time by a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracting parties undertake to surrender re@@ agents to the blood group determination to reimbur@@ se the costs of their extraction , preparation and carriage as well as the purchase price of other contracting parties if they have sufficient supplies for their own needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are made available to other contracting parties only under the condition that they are not used for medical purposes only , and only designated by the governments involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each shipment of re@@ agents for blood group determination is to add a certificate , that they were produced in accordance with the regulations of the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protocol and its facilities represent an administrative agreement , which can be amended or amended by governments of the contracting parties of this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties will take all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents made available to them from other contractual parties to the blood group determination of all input taxes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , they will take all necessary measures to ensure that these substances are quickly and easily tra@@ cked in Article 3 of the recipients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties submit to each other on the Secretary General of the Council of Europe a list of places that are entitled to the issu@@ ance of the certificate in accordance with Article 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin , these passages should be identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe for signature ; they can become contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Convention enters into force one month after the day that three members of the Council sign it in accordance with Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or have rati@@ fied or approved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each member , signing this Convention later without reservation or approval or approved , it shall enter into force one month after its signature or the deposit of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the entry into force of this Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe can invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notified the members of the Council and the Advisory States a ) the timing of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who signed it without reservation or approval or have rati@@ fied or approved ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with a period of one year , by indication of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g of the antibody or another on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter is measured in a suitable medium through repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be studied , twice in a suitable medium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely on the volume of the blood cells in the total volume . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood group determination of international standards , and standards developed for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to definition , an International Standard Prepar@@ ation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml ; and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 1 ) The efficacy of the re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ckers in a series of di@@ lution in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter indicates the re@@ agent of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of the re@@ agents for the blood group determination available for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the title of the unknown agent in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Lab for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following table shows an example of comparing the international standard serum anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its characteristics should remain valid for at least one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to label , lies at most one year after the last satisfactory test of efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the feasibility trials , and it is approved by the state supervisory authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , namely in the glass container in which it has been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight , if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ us in a pressure of not more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental body can determine that the agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to yield the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ti@@ zed or re @-@ dissolved serum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ opening , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ agents for blood group determination of the international exchange should not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least as long as an international agreement has come about a unified system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantity within a container must be so large that the content may be used , if necessary , to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all production stages and checks of the re@@ agents for the blood group determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents issued are to be kept from the laboratory for so long , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents used for the blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents may not contain substances of human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each individual tank is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4. the quantity or , for dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for the replacement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this label or the label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers have the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . the quantity or , for dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for the replacement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention , each consi@@ gn@@ ment must be enclosed to this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of selected people of group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain A @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB , including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group or equivalent comparison to ti@@ filtr@@ ate A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in no case , the efficacy of the serum may be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same attempt is done with the dissolved , un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of selected people of group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB , which contain no human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group or equivalent comparison to a flush of B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Anti @-@ B serum is bl@@ ended on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 percent flood of B blood cells the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time that is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is obtained from the blood of selected persons of group 0 which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain ag@@ glut@@ inu@@ gene A and / or B ; i.e. those of group A including sub@@ groups A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that contain no ag@@ glut@@ inu@@ gene A or B i.e. those of group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ Y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inated by anti @-@ A serum of the group B blood don@@ ors ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard Prepar@@ ation of the Anti @-@ A blood group or equivalent comparison of blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding comparative advantage against a flus@@ hing of B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in no case , the efficacy of the serum may be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also produce an easily identi@@ fiable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with equal amounts of 5 to 10 per cent floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , which is necessary if the same tests are performed with the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed to an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 percent of B @-@ blood cells the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time that is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity .
an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with the same amount of a 5 to 10 percent floo@@ ding of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which differ from the requirements below which an ag@@ glut@@ ination is achieved hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with others referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or using other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate round object carriers , also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are s@@ wollen in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements on the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for determining the R@@ h group may possibly change if international standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D serum or equivalent comparison to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells that contain do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are used to use object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people , which are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C serum ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 , compared to C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

sera the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time should not be less than with the ant@@ ei@@ dos@@ ed antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if Anti @-@ B serum is bl@@ ended on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 percent flood of B blood cells the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time that is necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved or un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum for use in the blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ inous antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin , ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obtained from the blood of animals , which are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , no matter what blood group they belong to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I allow myself to propose the following agreement , which will serve as the basis for co @-@ operation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , called &quot; Commission , &quot; can ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after &quot; Council &quot; to ask recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 . in view of the Commission &apos;s responsibility in matters of management of fish stocks , the Council appro@@ ves to present all relevant reports from its working groups to assess the situation and reports of its advisory board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . the Council and Commission are regularly advised on how to intensi@@ fy the cooperation between the two parties , and in particular examine the possibilities offered by the Commission to establish a closer connection to the Council &apos;s advisory board committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . in the signing of this agreement , the Community will pay a sum of 3@@ 76 000 D@@ KR and then make annual payments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the annual report not included , the costs for meetings conven@@ ed upon special request by the Commission are not included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , both parties are re @-@ examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement will be renewed on the basis of the existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at any time , every party has the possibility to withdraw from the agreement with a one @-@ year period of notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of clause 3 , the Council agrees to acknowledge the observer status at meetings of the Council &apos;s Advisory Committee on the Council of F@@ ish@@ eries Management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this capacity , the Commission &apos;s representative would have the right to ask the word and participate in meetings , but would not have the possibility of changing the agen@@ das of meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
