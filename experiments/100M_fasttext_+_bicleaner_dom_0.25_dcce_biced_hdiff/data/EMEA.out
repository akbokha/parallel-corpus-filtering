this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to reach recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packing instructions ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental disorder where the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) alternating with periods of normal mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes , and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients receiving the medicine in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection solution is used for quick monitoring of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both cases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or melt tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be reduced , should the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably acts above all as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but at a lesser degree than neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin plays a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing her re@@ formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , which prevents the re@@ appearance of symptoms , has been investigated in three studies over up to one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , the efficacy of the injection solution was compared with placebo over a period of two hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness with the treatment of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard dial for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the company conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for taking ( absor@@ bs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients receiving Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly greater anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the re@@ appearance of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo , and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders , nausea , nausea , nausea , nausea , rest@@ lessness , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. to approve Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients displaying mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is related to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after menop@@ ause of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if patients treated with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y suffer signs and symptoms of late dy@@ nasty , consider taking the dose or breaking the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , have to be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with cra@@ mp attacks in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with cra@@ mp attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ desirable zer@@ o@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ mer@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be observed regularly regarding deterioration of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight gain is commonly observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central potent medicines such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result in a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , potential benefits should out@@ weigh potential risks for the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) and 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ phy orph@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant , or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to insufficient data security for humans and because of the concerns raised in the case studies of the animal , this medicine may not be applied during pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of serving dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS includes parking in@@ son@@ ism , acu@@ pressure , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15,@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ ep@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment amounted to 23.@@ 3 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sp@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ity in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein bond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine d@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a dose @-@ dependent reduction of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ dents in response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ mine Rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % under placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an O@@ ur@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary aim &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a cure effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable percentage of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a return to man@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , which cataly@@ zes N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l with extensive metabol@@ isation over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pop @-@ simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which was not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional safety res@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular dangers to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent secondary @-@ level @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ carcin@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine d@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets may take the tablets alternatively to A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is related to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , in some cases after the beginning or after switching to an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy , during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the medicine ( * ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ahead of random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed himself superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were dos@@ ed according to dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the prevention of recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , therapy should continue with the same dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .

it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine d@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an O@@ ur@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary aim &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study in which Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy volunteers was the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection solution is used for quick control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under the circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lower dose of 5,@@ 25 mg ( 0,@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the drugs used for preservation or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets , A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets , or A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no investigations to the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders which have been caused differently from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ mer@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight gain is commonly observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater than the intra@@ muscular injection of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) in healthy volunteers , and the simultaneous Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) was intra@@ muscular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 105 The H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result in a common application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism in higher plasma concentrations of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 106 lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) was intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater than with the only gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sp@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ity in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of as@@ gi@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms regarding as@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
observed mean improvement from initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour limit was 5.@@ 8 for placebo and 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar effectiveness in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 week extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a return to man@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % greater than the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which were 15 or 5 times higher than the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application , no safety @-@ related concerns were found after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore they have limited or no importance for clinical application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent secondary @-@ level @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 times the mean @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ times the mean @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , attended by 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication contained in conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients with conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs such as time to deterioration of disease and survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatment of their metastatic breast cancer demonstrated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it may not be used in patients who have low neutr@@ ality rates in the blood before the treatment begins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Medic@@ inal Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ anes had no more effective treatment than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el treatment and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medications did not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing , and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ine count &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 during the subsequent series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment must be interrupted until a better dose of 1 or 2 is achieved , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were performed and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impaired ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient data for un@@ accept@@ ability and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formula of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated in patients until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ oses have risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while an un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac arrest in the indicated patient population is not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea can occur in patients following the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ eti@@ ka and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age that do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ tion method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child testi@@ fies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients should be advised before the treatment , because of the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect traffic and ability to operate machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following are the most common and most important cases of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasional : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ ine hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain@@ less chair , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness , very common : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events was established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules @-@ active substance that promotes the concentration of micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ in indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zes micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ isation results in in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ oth@@ eli@@ al cells and has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through end@@ oth@@ eli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ spon@@ d@@ oth@@ eli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ escent receptor and due to the alb@@ um@@ escent protein SP@@ ARC ( but@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two inhal@@ ed un@@ affiliated studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which in the form of an in@@ fusion was given over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 m@@ g. / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes in@@ fusion ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ al cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 The results for the overall response rate and time until disease progression as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ line therapy , are shown below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for rejection of bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml as similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 minutes in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane injection ( 43 % ) as after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only a few data is available about patients at the age of more than 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box , and in light of light over 8 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

using a sterile sy@@ ringe is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into an abra@@ x@@ ane glass bottle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after complete addition to the solution , the glass bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the hole should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes , and / or inver@@ ted until a complete reset of the powder is done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if precip@@ itations or sin@@ uses are visible , the glass bottle must be inver@@ ted again in order to achieve a complete reset before the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated and the corresponding amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PVC or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for the transport must ensure that the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 and presented in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , is established and works before and while the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is used to treat breast cancer when other therapies have been tried , but not successful , and if you do not question for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can not be used : • If you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el or any of the other components of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( initial values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ination of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about it )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special caution when using Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : if you have a impaired ren@@ al function , if you suffer num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness , if you suffer from serious liver problems , if you have heart problems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines , please inform the doctor if you use other medicines or have recently applied , as they might cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ tion method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they should be advised before the treatment over a sperm count , as the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility through the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
traffic ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can impact on the traffic and the ability to operate machines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are also receiving other medicines during your treatment , you should consult your doctor regarding driving or serving machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rare side effects ( at least 1 of 10,000 patients ) are : • lung infection • skin reaction to another substance after ir@@ radiation • blood cl@@ ots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects do significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not used immediately , it can be stored in a glass bottle of up to 8 hours in the fridge ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) in order to protect the contents from light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each drinking bottle contains 100 mg of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . • After the re@@ constitution each ml of the suspension contains 5 mg of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . • The other component is alb@@ umin@@ ous solution from the human ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) )
precau@@ tions for the preparation and use of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el are a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into an abra@@ x@@ ane glass bottle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the nozzle can be swi@@ vel@@ ed slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ t until a complete reset of the powder is made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calculate the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension and in@@ ject the corresponding amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane into an empty , sterile PVC in@@ fusion bag type IV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
par@@ enter@@ al drugs should be subjected to any particle and dis@@ col@@ oration prior to the application of a visual inspection whenever the solution or the container permit this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stability of un@@ opened bottles with abra@@ x@@ anes are stable up to the date given on the packaging , when the container is stored in the cardboard box to protect the content from light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should be filled immediately into an in@@ fusion bag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the market launch is provided by medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres , and retail stores with the following information and materials : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved by the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , who has experience in treating patients with diseases that the medicine is shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection can also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received appropriate instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron values of all patients are checked before the treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell containing a gene ( DNA ) , which em@@ powers them to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems , compared to the reference drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they either were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study , and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of inj@@ ected under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained by patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison to this , patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of evidence , the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce medic@@ ament P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for placing Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tum@@ ors , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the onset of chemotherapy ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.@@ 2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient when blood @-@ saving measures require ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic operation in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall illness ; therefore , the patient &apos;s individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose can be reduced by 25 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these clinical results indicate that patients with initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for controlling the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value should be increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic number of cells by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ dal Range of &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times per week the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ um rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the re@@ tic cell count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood kon@@ ser@@ ae is required should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week before surgical procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should present 300 I.@@ U. / kg pre@@ oper@@ atively on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine into circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin on an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease , or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ static PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with sudden loss of loss , defined as reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ ti@@ dal rate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ity , infections , ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) should be examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is reduced , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; index &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tic numbers should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnos@@ ing a PR@@ CA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 8 If patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed if er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is due to the concentration of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentrations and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients may need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction under the participation of the respective patient that should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are intended for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients receiving a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa can also be used for patients with an initial initial value of &gt; 13 g / dl to have an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer which received chemotherapy were returned if a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 to 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should control the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adapted to the growing hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , post@@ erior thro@@ mb@@ oses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can lead to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ lic and identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin that was isolated from the urine an@@ em@@ ic patient with regard to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ stom@@ st@@ oses ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas , 64 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 22 prostate cancer , 22 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 6@@ 83 mamm@@ ary carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ oses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survival and tumour progression was examined in five major controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients , four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and the control patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etics were consistent with an an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ ancies significantly higher mortality than in the controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and in the case of controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ c events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa regulations after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are achieved following intraven@@ ous injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 . in animal experiments with approximately the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished fet@@ al body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these reports rely on in vitro studies with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a maximum of 3 days outside the cooling box and not over 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gra@@ ding rings and the filling volume is indicated by an attached label , so if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 23 In case of chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in patients with chronic kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of approval for the transport has to ensure that the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and is functioning properly before the medicine is brought into circulation , and as long as the medicine is marketed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the Risk Management Plan outlined in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , is obliged to carry out the Risk Management Plan listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • with the receipt of new information , the influence on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures ) mil@@ estones following the E@@ MEA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • For a month before your treatment has suffered a heart attack or stroke , if you suffer from unstable Ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) - if you have already performed such a blood drop in the veins , for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( cereb@@ ral vascular disease ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you have recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it may occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood counts , which is back again in the course of further treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor may , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of iron , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated prior to treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very rarely , after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin of spec@@ kled ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ con@@ ia , it will break your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given by inj@@ ections into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in is the risk for problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the risk of death could be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an interruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to these findings , the treatment of blood ar@@ mo@@ sis with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood pigment ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a higher orthop@@ edic operation , you should examine the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before starting treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your values of the red blood color@@ ant ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines , or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means for building the immune system ( e.g. for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how your wor@@ m@@ wood ( an@@ emia ) speaks to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed certain value , the treating physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , you can learn how to squ@@ ir@@ t Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself among the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart , heart attack , brain hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( qu@@ ino@@ x oil ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ con@@ ia means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after repeated blood donations , it can come - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) when your initial message value is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects do significantly affect you or if you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a sy@@ ringe is taken out of the fridge and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) , both in women after menop@@ ause and in men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like with the H@@ inf@@ allen ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additionally , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , influ@@ enza @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , who recently had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that decreases bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study involving elderly women , the risk of cycl@@ ed frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures decreased by 41 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion , and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions at the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The provision of treatment in pregnancy and in nursing women , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission rate was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular Vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen may be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) in Pati@@ ents with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended for a limited clinical experience for this group of patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , since bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data are missing for lack of safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as there are only limited clinical experience for this patient population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia will be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with proper preventive dental treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients requiring dental interventions , no data is available to reduce the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen may be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron fo@@ lic was associated with kidney function disorders that expressed itself as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable to a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum @-@ cre@@ atine in 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial in the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local reactions after administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been treated especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ och@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ tions@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area at an Ac@@ la@@ sta and a patient treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , the administration of calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either one bone density value of ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ heavy existing verteb@@ ral body frac@@ ture ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral body frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the incidence of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a constant effect over three years which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in an increase of 41 % ( 95 % CI ( 17 % to 58 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip around 6.@@ 0 % , the cervi@@ cal diameter by 5.2 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison with placebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in serum was determined in intervals of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose decreased by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall survival was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study increased the BM@@ D in comparison to placebo treatment at all times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 24 months , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to a 5.@@ 4 % increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study were random@@ ised to 50@@ 8 men , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % , compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the once weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at based on the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed disease ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.6 times up to 3 times the upper normal average when recording in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six month comparative studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain and pain influence was observed in the combined results compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients , which were classified as respon@@ dents at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( had responded to the therapy ) , could be included in a follow @-@ up phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the 143 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach to 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate was maintained during an average duration of 18 months following the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of co@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic van@@ ishing from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination period with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 14@@ 6 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early work phases ( α and β , with the above -@@ ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the fast resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decreased clearing of met@@ ro@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron &apos;s acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible agent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance - 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in 64 patients .
this results in an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because for severe kidney dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance , &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in dogs studies , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous use was determined in intervals of 0.2 mg / kg ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 6 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated expos@@ ures , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver and the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spontaneous tumor in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rats , one observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of decreased serum calcium levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage period following preparation and conditions before the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive on risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , the current statements on security , the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities might affect minim@@ ization of risk . • On request of E@@ MEA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron &apos;s acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the murder of the bone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone reconstruction , ensuring a normal bone formation and gives the bone more strength again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines Please tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other medicines / use / apply recently / applied , even if it is not prescription . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you take medicine , known by those who are known to damage the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drinks , you are concerned that you take enough fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after operating the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta acts for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low during the in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache arise within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or num@@ b@@ bing or num@@ b@@ bing feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an allergic reaction , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if one of the side effects listed you significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular Vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packing instructions ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above respectively • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more I
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , four studies were carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used in comparison to a placebo as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting up smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the studies on the setting of smoking , however , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess in this application area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA ? he The most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA observed during the trials ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caution is required at the same time using A@@ COMP@@ LIA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medication against fung@@ al infections ) , y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ COMP@@ LIA in relation to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing information packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the ar@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also increases diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) that have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ COMP@@ LIA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La depres@@ sive diseases or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the benefits of treatment in an individual case exceed the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to obesity , it also occurs in patients with no recognis@@ able risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relatives or other close relatives are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms , and immediately get medical advice if these symptoms occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

summary of EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ination Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the trials conducted to reach recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ otrop@@ ic substance or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ otrop@@ ic substance or insulin can be maintained except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one was evaluated in tri@@ ple@@ tion ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos led to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ otrop@@ ic substance in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value was 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo had led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , showed a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of blood - in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been decided that acet@@ in should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin , which is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a if Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on may not be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction like un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper abdom@@ en , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enzymes must be checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one continues , should be led until the laboratory parameters are prescribed by the clinical evaluation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be absorbed by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a slight reduction of middle hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution under therapy with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparing controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3.1 % and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ otrop@@ ic substance or two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acuity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a ; however prescription doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a summari@@ zing analysis of messages un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 years of patients with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures appeared in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be removed ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug interactions that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ duc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance of the mother animal in pregnancy , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated from available data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lead to a temporary modification of the tower and refrac@@ ting index of the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents went beyond three times the upper limit of the normal range , however more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ amin resin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under placebo if Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a summary analysis of messages un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study period over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day after seven days , no symptoms appeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ dal as mon@@ otherapy was carried out over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ised to Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued only insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the initial values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most clinical studies , compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels were observed , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ dal decreased overall plasma levels and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was found under Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on , while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ dal decreased levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also enhanced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels by means of an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on generally 2 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minim@@ ally pronounced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in interaction studies it has been proven that Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) or decreases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ ces ( 55 % ) , and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mean plasma @-@ elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of oral traction of the parent substance are similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , rats , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ded after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the fact that in treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an led to an increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 years of patients with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures appeared in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ dal have been investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the initial values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also enhanced the post@@ den@@ dro@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels as well as an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the study was lacking in terms of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of total ring@@ ing , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was tested to 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar levels have been lowered similar to another human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) , or any of the other components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , in the treatment of diabetes , the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds , to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can detect the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , human insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic responses after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions during therapy and ask his patients always after other medicines taken by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 Free hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes treatment increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or cra@@ mps , and with temporary or persistent dis@@ ruption of brain function and even death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diseases of the nervous system gels - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort associated with acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and usually reversible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar level , however , may be associated with a temporary degradation of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diseases of the skin and the skin tissue - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection point a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur if missed to change the insertion points within the injection area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general illnesses and complaints at the site of gel@@ ding - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Sever@@ e hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia is treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.@@ 0 mg ) , or by glucose that is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of the operation is up to 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resor@@ ption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of fis@@ sile ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered , and none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional safety res@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the implementation of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union by Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the fast acting insulin must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3,5 hours and the total duration of the operation is approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose can be corrected either upward or down@@ wards , by turning the dos@@ ed dial button in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is placed opposite the dosage of the dose display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or plaster nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first treatment months , even plaster attacks can occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to take medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant , since it was not examined for these groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study , participated in 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different chor@@ o@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a placebo ( placebo ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , two doses of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients , whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily received 120 mg of urine during the last three measurements obtained a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 13@@ 4 patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ at@@ deposits ( including a current node known or present in the case of illness and / or arthritis ) .
a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily after 2 - 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe kidney function restrictions , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there are no experiences in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other di@@ ure@@ tic medicines , acute g@@ out attack can occur during the treatment , because ur@@ ic acid deposits can initially be mobili@@ zed in the tissue by lowering serum levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin increases in the urine in rare cases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , minor ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was no interaction studies carried out to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine level ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x showed a medium 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ ide , slow@@ ed down the intake of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a reduction of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancy can not be close to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a num@@ eri@@ cally higher incidence of cardiovascular events observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection could be detected with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ clerosis and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ) and a total of more than once reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 3 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the events related to the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all cases of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 , or with a lower frequency : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the effect mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism in humans and occurs in the context of the reaction sk@@ ate Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ory lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study , as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
placebo ( n = 13@@ 4 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ mental value to study beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were sum@@ mar@@ ised for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of serum levels at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d. h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no clinical significant differences in the percentage decline of serum concentration in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the group of patients with serum concentration of serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the sustained reduction of serum levels of serum was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a watering rate ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a cast ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the gyp@@ sum node , which resulted in 54 % of the total disappearance of the plaster nodes by month 24 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ ie / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intake of simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration concentration provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding on alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) and its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the medium total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ and / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver function After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) Li@@ ver function changes the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to normal liver function .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites following the intake of multiple or@@ ally doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in elderly patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition , and are considered not relevant for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which was accompanied by a decrease in the performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with expos@@ ures , such as 4,@@ 3 times and in supporting rab@@ bits with expos@@ ures , which are approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 3 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the sustained reduction of serum levels of serum was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a watering rate ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a cast ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly compared with normal liver function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of approval for the transport has to ensure that a pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is ready before the medicine is brought into circulation , and as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline , an updated R@@ MP can be submitted to risk management systems for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • when new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk management activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( phar@@ ma vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ isation ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some cases , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you hold the ur@@ ic acid concentration through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the crystal formation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart failure or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) is treated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden occurrence of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is off before you begin with the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines , if necessary , to prevent diarr@@ ho@@ ea or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines , or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is particularly important for you to inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take medicine using AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC and your doctor may consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ c@@ top@@ urine ( for treatment of cancer ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine ( for treating asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for treating asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease )
there have been no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on traffic and the ability to operate machines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from an intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster packs the individual week@@ days are printed , so you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have un@@ intentionally taken an over@@ dose , please contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , get it as soon as possible unless the next dose is shortly before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you stop taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , your ur@@ ic acid concentration can increase again , and your complaints can wor@@ sen as new urine crystals can form in your joints and kidneys as well as their surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common side effects ( more than 1 out of 100 treatment , but less than 1 out of 10 treatment ) : • Pre@@ cious liver tests • diarr@@ hea • headache • rash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rare side effects ( more than 1 of 10,000 people , but less than 1 out of 1,000 patients ) : • weakness • nerv@@ ousness • Dur@@ ing feeling • pal@@ pit@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects do significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this information .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for treating oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lay down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) compared to those who were solely responsible for al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also presented data that present the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is required to prevent bone loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diarr@@ hea ) , ul@@ cer ( swal@@ lowing ) , batter@@ ed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as sour re@@ traction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be used in cases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued the merger of Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to transport AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can be given only with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strokes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( some were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the doctor should point attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dispens@@ ing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a were rare ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men predominantly administered intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data available that give clu@@ es , whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is author@@ itative for therapy planning , for each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be instructed to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after they have noticed their failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should not take two tablets the same day , but should continue taking one tablet per week as originally scheduled on the scheduled day of the week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before beginning treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at leave no indication of direct damaging effects with regard to pregnancy that detect embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the serum levels decreased to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) Vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light , over the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ves to vitamin D@@ 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main effect of vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum calcium , calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in severe cases , a deficiency can lead to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie and thus to a further increased risk for falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bone mineral density in spine or hip , which is 2.5 standard deviations below the average for a normal , young population , or irrespective of bone density as a present path@@ ological frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

after a 15 @-@ week treatment the mean serum levels of 25 hydro@@ xy@@ lic D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) decreased significantly after 15 weeks of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 hydro@@ xy@@ lic D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 3@@ 70 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in phase III studies , the average stimulation of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years amounted to 8.@@ 8 % on the spinal column , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the Tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction in the placebo group was reached by 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % ) in the proportion of patients suffering one or more verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and trou@@ gh continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fit consisted of two pla@@ z@@ ebo@@ at studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least a new fluid frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption Be@@ ac@@ kled on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg following night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in healthy volunteers the administration of or@@ alem Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 distribution studies of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed according to IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ated into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ activity was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after intraven@@ ous dosage of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing passed not 200 ml / min .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption Of healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) was after the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a meal the middle area under the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 mirror ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an time up to the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the liver , vitamin D@@ 3 is quickly hydro@@ xy@@ lic and then met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ lic D@@ 3 , the bio@@ active form , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the F@@ ä@@ ces after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the share of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , headache , nausea / vom@@ iting , diarr@@ hea , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hypertension ) , hypertension and in@@ som@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ f as the adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication that is taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap top with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only physicians , who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients , should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of a transition to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level mirrors should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after switching . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both ni@@ er@@ y- and liver transplan@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ care phase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the adv@@ agra@@ f dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the condition of the patient does not allow oral treatment in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate ) with a dose of ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; duration of the application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplantation The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as daily dosage in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further dosage adjustments can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change after transplantation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplantation The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as daily dosage in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted by a tran@@ spl@@ ant recipient of twice daily dose of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of adv@@ agra@@ f . this change@@ over in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) has to take place in relation to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplantation After a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ f once daily the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant must begin with the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart tran@@ spl@@ ant in adult patients , which are converted to adv@@ agra@@ f , is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day to be taken once daily in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients showed no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ f in lung and pancre@@ atic and colon cancer patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood flow in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with reduced kidney function , as the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including regular determination of serum levels ) , a calculation of the in@@ in@@ in@@ aris and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume is recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first instance , the dose should be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform common checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c inspections during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blood @-@ seb@@ um of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adaptation , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the level of the level in the blood is 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical practice , the level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in transplan@@ ted and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be more effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult cardiac tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers and tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers in childhood , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , taking herbal supplements ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to avoid other plant remedies during treatment with adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentration in the blood is required , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood mirrors can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases , a det@@ ectable chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders include an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to suitable clothing or use of sun protection using a high protection factor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision disturbances should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; da adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose @-@ free , is especially recommended in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level at the same time offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a strongly pronounced interaction has been achieved with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like ket@@ con@@ az@@ ole , fluid con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ ey@@ eli@@ d antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal contamination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus slow@@ s down the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives , so that hormon@@ al exposure can increase particularly cau@@ ti@@ ously in decisions about contrac@@ tive measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and their half @-@ life can pro@@ long .
the results of a low number of examinations in tran@@ spl@@ ant patients provide no indication that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants an increased risk of un@@ desirable events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy is made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in uter@@ o exposure , it is advisable to monitor the new@@ born on any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ inflation of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s disease and simultaneous treatment with a multitude of other medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ≥ 1 / 10 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases as well as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often elevated in patients with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ a ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal Leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ fiable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
action mechanisms and pharmac@@ o@@ co @-@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell , thereby preventing tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus inhi@@ bits the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the T cells , the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 receptor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

patients &quot; survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0.@@ 8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; 25 ( 14 women and 11 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women and 19 men ) deaths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of adv@@ agra@@ f and pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm , 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ x@@ ima@@ b antibody production , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , loss of transplan@@ tion or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) .
the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ ph C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % ) for adv@@ agra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .

published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily applied Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sor to pancre@@ as , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 175 treatment @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal tran@@ spl@@ ant , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was consistent in these published studies in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lung transplantation In an interim analysis over a recently conducted , multi @-@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was observed in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0,@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ l@@ dr@@ one and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ aties et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis increased in 2@@ 1.7 % compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . ; An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment @-@ transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ thy et al . ; J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advance is used to treat and prevent hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage and frequency of the application will depend on whether lawyers are used to treat bleeding , or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , resulting in bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is brought into , which em@@ powers it to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advance is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins or animal origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures has been investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ant in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ als was evaluated with &quot; excellent &quot; resp@@ . &quot; good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of advance ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advance may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impairment are removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeat inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the risk is over for the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the treatment course , adequate provision of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , various in vivo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by adequate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage speed should be directed after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ orientated Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk depends on the first 20 expos@@ ures and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 position days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ ian well @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , VI@@ II @-@ product was observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II to inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there is no experience regarding the application of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which exhibit a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decline of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ ke was observed in a patient using continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials involving A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with severe severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in none of 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to the traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms appeared that showed an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 As in other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E was reported on hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated factor IX , acceler@@ ating the formation of activated factor X by factor X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients alike or &gt; 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special caution when using A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E is necessary to inform your doctor if you have recently been treated with factor VI@@ II products , especially if you have developed inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these symptoms can represent early signs of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic shock , which can include the following symptoms : extreme di@@ zz@@ iness , loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use other medicines , please tell your doctor if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your doctor will calculate your dose A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E ( in international units or I.@@ U. ) depending on your physical condition and your body weight and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data available since initial approval , CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , and decided that the regi@@ stran@@ t will apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited granted the Medic@@ inal Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw its application for approval of Adv@@ ance for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissue that connects other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) is affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified , that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ance is a &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and thus no infection can be triggered in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , thus enabling the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ 53 protein formed by the p@@ 53 gene which is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and divide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub @-@ building , in the bones and in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the CH@@ MP tested the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the examination of the documents submitted , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours have demonstrated benefits for patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company did not know whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients , who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programmes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so compound that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen caused inflammation of the nas@@ al channels ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main efficacy was the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms , which were reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against nor@@ adren@@ ergi@@ c substances or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for treating allergies ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in patients who suffer from con@@ junc@@ tival glaucoma , hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis , or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued an approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union to the SP Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data for un@@ accept@@ ability and efficacy , ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after sounding the symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after decreasing the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ oli , etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective , and the data do not suff@@ ice to give appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not examined in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data do not suff@@ ice to give appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be informed that treatment with hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or strengthening of headache ) must be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caution : • Pati@@ ents suffering from a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder surgery or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ cians can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or@@ ical test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with either des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that drug interactions can not be completely ruled out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured . experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impairment of traffic and ability to operate machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , anxiety , fri@@ ghtened mi@@ c@@ tion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ dial pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , ey@@ esi@@ ght , hypertension , or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ illary di@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ oth@@ eli@@ al cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective m@@ ack@@ ness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was detected in comparison to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause other symp@@ tom@@ atic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S @-@ arous@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients were treated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s between 12 and 78 years , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , the immun@@ o@@ deficiency efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than in a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane , was significantly higher than with a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences regarding sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a single dose study for Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is detected within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers for more than 14 days , the floating equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was achieved on day 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly confused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional safety res@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application , the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system described and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms , preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine mu@@ cous membrane , which is contained in this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to a nar@@ rowing of the stomach or the du@@ oden@@ um ) , a closure of the stomach or the du@@ oden@@ um ( respiratory ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed with aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze following symptoms or diseases : • High blood pressure • Cardi@@ ac disease , heart rhythm disorders , nausea and headache , or strengthening existing head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines In case of use at the recommended dosage , it is not expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you ought to inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and use the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects do significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the market launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach pain , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , headache , headache , headache , headache , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , loss of liver disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ zer for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup resp@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup resp@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who also had asthma ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were summari@@ zed , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % compared to a decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , the two studies with A@@ eri@@ us were 58 and 33 % compared to patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2001 , the European Commission issued an approval to the Company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ as in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to previous disease progression and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms of the symptoms and may be resum@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a decrease in traffic and ability to operate machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most frequently encountered side effects , reported more frequently than in placebo , were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ am@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multiple dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ oth@@ eli@@ al cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ am@@ n was administered over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ am@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective m@@ ack@@ ness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology irrespective of the eti@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be rec@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since hist@@ amine is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
improvement of the it@@ ching stimulus by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ am@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced sleep and w@@ aking , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic trial , which were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients have reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation , after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vivo , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional safety res@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular danger for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken apart from meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of a infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which met@@ abo@@ li@@ zes , is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ cro@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not enhanced the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group , similar to the placebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multiple dose study of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy were diagnosed with a dose of 1.@@ 25 mg . ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between the ages of 6 and 11 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the progression of hypo@@ ge@@ tis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials led to no impairment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a strengthening of alcohol induced performance impairment nor increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion , and it@@ ching of eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets reduce the effect caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults and 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ us ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are severely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the load ( AU@@ C ) was about 6 times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 In various single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max levels of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ am@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that drug interactions can not be completely ruled out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ ung@@ lass tanks with a child safe polypropylene junction with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate must be removed without damaging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose trial , which was up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times a clinical dose ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was detected in comparison to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of flight performance , including reinforcement of subjective m@@ ack@@ ness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic trial , which were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients have reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets apply once daily in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ as in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg weld tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for det@@ ecting des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined for pedi@@ atric patients , but the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dose in children aged 6 to 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine children between the ages of 2 and 11 , which met@@ abo@@ li@@ zes limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ cro@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group , similar to the placebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common side @-@ effects reported was diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study , at a single dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also interact with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since A@@ eri@@ us contains solution for taking the same concentration on des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no Bio@@ equi@@ valence study was necessary and it is expected that it comp@@ lies with the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in various single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max levels of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ am@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially announced to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company accepts his application for the transfer of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a special type of vaccine that could protect against a strain of the flu virus , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because people still have no immunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; foreign body &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the immune system will later be able to make contact with a influ@@ enza virus of this common molecule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as a foreign body ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; Good Clinical Practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the extent of the clinical data basis for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for treating adults and children over four years which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) that causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medication the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of p@@ inion and other anti@@ viral medicines are taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase lowers the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aids not to cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without k@@ night studies , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , with low dose levels , was compared with other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) , or the change in viral load after treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , very few responded to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with adults , who had previously been treated with Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors , the medication used to increase viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment was as effective as other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase to a stronger viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ bo@@ sis may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should also not be used in patients with cur@@ rant ( herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are reduced equally to as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ generating immune system ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ night avi@@ r in patients previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally authorised under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was available for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , am@@ on@@ ase capsules are to be administered to am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r twice a day , together with 100 mg of p@@ inion twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the added addition of p@@ inion ( booster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data for un@@ accept@@ ability and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adults with moderate liver dys@@ functions should be reduced to 300 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width , and can also present medi@@ ums of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
herbal preparations containing cur@@ rants ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r while taking amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ nights and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver damage with potentially fatal progression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please consult the specialist information of this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with advanced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides which are confused by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceed the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 it is not recommended to admini@@ ster A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the agent concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who take these drugs simultaneously , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patients should be monitored on breath removal symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient populations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be cancelled in duration 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ a@@ mac@@ eration of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the patients had other illnesses associated with therapy medications , which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in h@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ oma occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and can also display medi@@ ums of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with p@@ inion may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly confused with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in trying to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ night avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient already occupies Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the amp@@ ar mirrors and , if possible , check the virus load and susp@@ end cur@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max. decreases by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily were used to demonstrate the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) was administered twice a day in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a closely mes@@ hed monitoring as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic trial was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the imag@@ inary component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in combination with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and k@@ night ra@@ viol@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would reduce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of N@@ evi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that N@@ evi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should these drugs be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous administration of am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in adverse events associated with fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ ck@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is advised , although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in the plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 degree ) once daily without the simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r with k@@ eto@@ vi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other drugs that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can possibly result in interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , patients should be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data of other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase because it may cause resor@@ ption dysfunction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects increased the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of adren@@ ase with k@@ night cavi@@ ar together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceed the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 are distinct increases in the plasma level while con@@ serving as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as plasma level increases in this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may lead to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zing the mirror , as the plasma concentrations can be increased by cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , while simultaneously offering amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while using as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 fa@@ ec@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for emergency symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , as the amp@@ ar dose is adapted once amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or reinfor@@ cing the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of an additional administration of k@@ night on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful observation of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time with an@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk lac@@ tate rats , am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a decreased increase in 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period showed a reduction in pregnant rats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the further development of descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r to the dam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults and children over the age of 4 , the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects associated with the as@@ gener@@ ase treatment were moderate to moderate , occurred early and rarely resulted in the treatment outbreak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for the treatment of HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which previously untreated patients receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and were performed with more than 1 % of the patients as well as laboratory changes occurring during the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients including loss of peripheral and fa@@ al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue . hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation ( bull crack ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral inhibit@@ ors treated with am@@ ni@@ v@@ ud@@ ine in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skin r@@ ashes were generally mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontaneously disappeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors such as advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in the event of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day with low dose levels ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed , except for increased levels of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d and CP@@ K patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary are necessary supporting measures to be initiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the process of viral gene and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ arity with the result of a formation of un@@ provoked , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r lies in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in case of chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the age of sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the trial ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred by week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be examined gen@@ otyp@@ ically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients , showed resistance patterns , similar to those in adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors appeared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used for the interpretation of results of a resistance test .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross resistance to k@@ night avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is generally preserved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently data for cross resistance between Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ances , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral and not pre @-@ treated patients ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ren@@ oun@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice versa , Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
early demo@@ lition of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rite avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ slip threshold of 0.4 to 10 copies / ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies , as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 In order to optimize treatment with PI pres@@ et children , 19 Basi@@ cally on these data should be considered to be the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; as@@ gener@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r takes about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decline in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by the intake of food although the simultaneous eating intake affects the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to about 430 litres ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of the blood stream into the tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while absolute concentration remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total dose concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with care if they are given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily amp@@ ar exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules , hence , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these treatment schemes lead to Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r plasma levels , comparable to those obtained at healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of k@@ night cavi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , gen@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas ( rats ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily application of 1200 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings resulted from the exposure data of the human being from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro@@ kernel test in rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen , nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients in clinical studies , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mortality , both in the control animals and in the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 24 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the added addition of p@@ inion ( booster ) , higher doses should be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max. decreases by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a closely mes@@ hed monitoring as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would reduce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ ck@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects increased the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or reinfor@@ cing the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a decreased increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults and children over the age of 4 , the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary are necessary supporting measures to be initiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r lies in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice versa , Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of patients treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while absolute concentration remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total dose concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with care if they are given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats occurring in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas observed in dos@@ ages of 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( rats ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dosage of 1200 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , from the present exposure data to humans , both clinical trials and the therapeutic application , however , there were little evidence for the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro@@ kernel test in rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen , nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mortality , both in the control animals and in the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation routes are not fully mature in young animals , causing amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution was not approved for patients with PI previously treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to take up ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there should be no dosage recommendation for simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dos@@ ed k@@ night cavi@@ ar , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , patients with impaired liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of these drugs , and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in h@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ oma occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max. decreases by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the potential risk for humans is unknown . due to possible toxic reactions , the fet@@ us should not be used during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk lac@@ tate rats , am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a decreased increase in 55 body weight was shown during the lac@@ tation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults and children over the age of 4 , the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for the treatment of HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , 62 % of this data should be considered to be the benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; as@@ gener@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to about 430 litres ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large c@@ ousin volume and an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . - This medicine was personally prescribed to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can harm other people even if they have the same ail@@ ments as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to use A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effect of as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of as@@ gener@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor , and your treatment history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above @-@ mentioned conditions , or take any of the drugs above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r to enhance the effect ( boo@@ sters ) , make sure you have read the utility information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully before the treatment begins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also no adequate information to recommend the application of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with k@@ night avi@@ r for the impact ampli@@ fication of children aged 4 to 12 , or in general in patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines , &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control bleeding . − In patients receiving an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , collection or loss of body fat can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have certain medicines which may lead to serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended that HIV positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under no circumstances to prevent HIV transmission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines There were no studies on the influence of as@@ gener@@ a on the driving ability , or the ability to operate machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important information about certain other components of as@@ gener@@ ase solution to include The solution to take @-@ up contains propylene gly@@ co@@ l , which can cause side effects in high doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l may cause a number of side effects including var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase is necessary precau@@ tions ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and face , fat increase in the abdom@@ en and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat grow@@ ths in the neck ( &quot; pins &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other ingredients are Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l , To@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( T@@ P@@ GS ) , Ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial ch@@ ewing gum , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate d@@ ih@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frequency of application and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas the cream is to be added five times a week for six weeks . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses it is to be applied three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains sufficiently long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the drug ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and took Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a , in addition , has been tested in two studies to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . in all four main studies , the total treatment rate was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible clin@@ ches have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area , or up to 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an interruption of the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) , or if an infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to be applied in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned , moist@@ ened skin area until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these patients , weighing is carried out between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these patients , weighing is carried out between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft vs. host reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other studies , in which no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ k@@ score that is becoming a circumcision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation were observed also under proper application which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impairment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , no clinical experience exists for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied means for the treatment of external in@@ clin@@ ations in the genital and peripheral areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of inf@@ anti@@ cide reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown less effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of in@@ clin@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair approach was not investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period of several days may be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed about 12 weeks after the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is currently no data on long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate forms of treatment should be considered in the case of super @-@ certified bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is available , so the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only very limited information about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face , and the scal@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the under@@ arm and hands do not support effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de @-@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although neither the serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were achieved neither after a one @-@ time nor after several times , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most frequently communicated and possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of in@@ clin@@ ations ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most frequently reported and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects include complaints at the application place with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects , the results reported by I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme are shown below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection , were in these studies a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects , which were noted by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , are listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently leads to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / de@@ formation ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream was very frequent ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe atro@@ phy ( 19 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical studies investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accidental single oral recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous hydr@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to show that the efficacy in relation to a complete curing of the in@@ clin@@ ations during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment was clearly superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients were treated completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficially confirmed bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week treatment period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acu@@ ations within a connected 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approved indications of external clin@@ ching , ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ inten@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma are usually not observed in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3@@ x / week , for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a minimal systemic absorption of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest concentrations of drugs at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours . in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 p@@ ou@@ ches ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ ho@@ ur@@ ly half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low from 6 to 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ ficially portable bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study for the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects for the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during one @-@ time administration , on three days a week , did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ical absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for human beings is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the effective free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this utility information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the gen@@ itals of the gen@@ itals ( genital organs ) and the anus ( after ) have formed a frequently growing type of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it remains untreated , it can lead to distortion , especially in the face - therefore a early detection and treatment is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in humans that were exposed to sunlight during their life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in case of flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has chosen that Al@@ dar@@ a is the best suitable treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for the infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O If you already used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other medicines , please inform your doctor about this before treating any problems with your immune system . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if allergic reactions occur in the treated area after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream , do not apply cream with a band@@ age or patch . o If allergic reactions occur in the treated area , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . o inform your doctor if they do not have a normal blood pattern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this daily cleansing is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling of the skin or difficulty can be expected to re@@ tract the fores@@ kin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have sexual intercourse during the infection with in@@ clin@@ ations in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Creme is after sexual intercourse ( not before ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not satisfy your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Creme , because it is not known whether i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od sur@@ passes into breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of in@@ clin@@ ations , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the feet and rub gently on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men with in@@ clin@@ ations under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin each day and wash the skin area underneath ( see Section 2 &quot; What do you have to consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a Creme ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 6 weeks , apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream per week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common side effects ( in less than 1 out of 10 patients expected ) Have common side effects ( in less than 1 out of 1,000 patients expected ) Very rare adverse events ( in less than 1 out of 10,000 patients expected ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Al@@ dar@@ a Creme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Creme , you should not use the cream to wash the affected area with water and mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lower number of blood cells can cause you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to produce a blue stain sooner or later , or it can cause ab@@ ut@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects do significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas that you applied Al@@ dar@@ a Creme ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the time , it is about easier skin reactions which may sound once again within 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally some patients notice changes at the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from alterations to the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , swelling , heat sensation or discomfort ) , inflammation of the eye li@@ ds , sore throat , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , fever , weakness , or ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic treatment in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , stiff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , reduced lung volume , heart and eye disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor , who possesses experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of Al@@ endur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization equipment , and patients may require appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent allergic reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study focused mainly on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was measured in terms of reducing G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by approximately 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of more than five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , where necessary update and update this summary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me manufactures patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , observing the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to approve Al@@ endur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme treatment in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor , who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , these patients should also continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in which recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , the risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ tious after an interruption of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 60 minutes before beginning the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ka ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an easy or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies do not affect direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , it is recommended to not meet with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which have been observed in 45 patients at the age of 5 or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years , are frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ unconditional involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , c@@ rest and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children Un@@ desired drug interactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which have been reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment for a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with a more severe si@@ eve form usually within a month to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to the end of the phase 3 trial ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with missing or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vitro that seemed to not imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation , the enzymes are sufficient to restore the enzyme activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were affected by the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V , and the absolute path in the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms each week for 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and capacity in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over this period , the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant and the total lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ ac@@ eous before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first four weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the average follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a normal mental development speed was observed in several patients ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group . the younger patients with severe free@@ wheel form showed a normal mental development speed whereas older patients with severe free@@ wheel form were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a phase 4 trial , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosage regi@@ mens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional safety res@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there are no compatibility studies carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines unless listed under 6.@@ 6. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if the di@@ lution is performed under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the given period , the holder of approval for the transport has to complete the following study program , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this register becomes longer @-@ term security and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data about the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase is split up , which contains certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in low amounts before or this enzyme is completely absent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction has occurred on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you take drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instructions for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate for producing an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for IV use ( see information for physicians or medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - unconditional involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however severe reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing stops and facial oils . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( occurrence in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • rash disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • hypertension &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the packing unit will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if the di@@ lution is performed under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • first determine the number of di@@ lution bottles to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( other medicines for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer treatment ) and &quot; mal@@ ign &quot; ( malign@@ ant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients previously untreated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , canc@@ eled or reduced the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from sharing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration of activity in cancer cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 people with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells , when administration of A@@ lim@@ ta continued survival compared to the drug therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the deployment of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union to Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each glass bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is extracted from the glass bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
for patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions on the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift , as well as on the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the dosage should be continued during the whole therapy period and for another 21 days after the final P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1,000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third operating cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a full blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and plat@@ el@@ et counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose test must take place under the supervision of the N@@ adi@@ r of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recovery , the patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are to be applied for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 bleeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except for neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - in case of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 , or in comparison to patients aged 65 , there is an increased side effect risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient data for un@@ accept@@ ability and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adap@@ tations were necessary , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data location in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients need to be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ sh@@ alling and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality rate has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te count has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ iry toxic@@ ity as they were observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ cot@@ ic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was considered to be treated when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous consumption of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed are intended to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long semi @-@ life for at least 5 days before therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many patients experienced these events had risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment is to be weighed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five key cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible recovery of reproductive capacity is indicated by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be cau@@ tioned in front of the treatment regi@@ men to obtain advice regarding sperm preservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen = 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased incidence of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy to be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
as there is no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long semi @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ ne@@ y- an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy , except if necessarily - demanding and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity exists by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to get advice regarding the sperm @-@ service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed leaves in breast milk , and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby can not be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 of three P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherap@@ ies ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these under@@ - parties are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population as the pha@@ sis 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were random@@ ised to patients with N@@ SC@@ LC and 8@@ 30 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC who were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from clinical studies patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed were occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cases of radi@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fold that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed works as an anti@@ fold with multiple attack points by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ co@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin demonstrated a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit to patients who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary analysis of this study was made in the population of all patients , who received the examination medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the case of the Lun@@ - gen@@ esis symptom scale in A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the all@@ u@@ cle@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy had a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an analysis of hist@@ ology in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC in patients with squ@@ am@@ ous cell carcin@@ oma ( n = 17@@ 2 , 6.@@ 2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , matched HR = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the analysis of the impact of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant under@@ - or hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CI = Conc@@ ern@@ ation interval ; IT@@ T = Ori@@ entation interval ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally set for non @-@ superi@@ ority with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ negative limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % vs. 4.5 % ; p = 0.@@ 00@@ 2 ) .

the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed according to administration as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ons over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , unchanged within 24 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total of 9@@ 1,8 ml / min and half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , who received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ tik@@ ul@@ inary changes were observed ( degeneration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ er epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless otherwise applied , storage times and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dissolve the contents of the 100 mg capsule with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ ative . this results in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising product quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each glass bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have not received prior chemotherapy , in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for treating cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have kidney disease or earlier , please discuss it with your doctor or hospital pharmac@@ ist since you may not be allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be performed before any in@@ fusion of blood tests , checking whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your doctor may possibly change the dose or stop the treatment if your general condition requires and if your blood values are too low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will get the necessary medicines to avoid vom@@ iting before and after C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a fluid accumulation around the lungs , your doctor may decide to eliminate this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to buy a child during the treatment or during the first 6 months of treatment , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hospital doctor , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with sterile 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be cor@@ ti@@ son tablets ( according to 4 mg D@@ exam@@ eth@@ - son twice a day ) that you have to take on the day before and during the day following the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will prescri@@ be fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) for intake or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain fo@@ lic acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) to prescri@@ be you during the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA once a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the week before the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) , you will also receive an injection of Vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ gram ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this utility information , a side effect is described as &quot; very common &quot; means that it was reported by at least 1 out of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; frequent , &quot; this means that it was reported of at least 1 out of 100 patients but was reported less than 1 out of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a side effect is described as &quot; occasional &quot; - indicates that they were reported by at least 1 out of 1,000 but less than 1 out of 100 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fever or infection ( often ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or above , swe@@ ating or other signs of infection ( because you may have less white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you feel tired or weak , quickly get into breath or look pale ( because you may have fewer hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in than normal , which is very common ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you find a bleeding g@@ ums , nose or mouth or another bleeding that does not come to a halt , or have a red@@ dish or pink urine or unexpected bru@@ ising ( because you may have fewer blood plat@@ el@@ ets than normal , which is very common ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally ( occurs at least 1 out of 1,000 patients , but less than 1 of 100 patients ) increased pulse rate Co@@ litis ( inflammation of the inner lining of the colon and end@@ gut ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

dissolve the contents of the 500 mg por@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic bottles with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ ative which results in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who take All@@ i and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in food , causing about a quarter of the fats that have been added to food in@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , the All@@ i 60 mg , had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at after , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ h@@ ula , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , dra@@ ins ( winds ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there are not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich diet or low @-@ fat diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic must be adapted if necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients receiving all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to take additional pregn@@ ancies @-@ prevention measures , in order to prevent the failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients who have been treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate intake of vitamins ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the administration of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on one @-@ off dose , a marginal amount of healthy volunteers was observed at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , because absorption of captured fat is prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of known side @-@ effects reported after the introduction of or@@ list@@ at has not been known , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; † It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i may lead to tri@@ mming with regard to possible , or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects , without significant clinical findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid return formation of possible systemic effects can be assumed to be attributed to the assimil@@ ating properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the therapeutic effect is based on the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine , by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic elev@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from clinical studies , 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary parameter that changes the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) has been evaluated as follows : as a variation of the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their starting weight ( table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest loss of weight in the first 6 months occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average change in the total ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ess was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( starting value : 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( starting value : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In general , therapeutic doses not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of obes@@ e patients with minimal systemic absorbed dose , M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ c@@ ine group ) could be identified , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies on safety res@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food di@@ aries are effective as you can understand at any time , what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your dietary habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to safely reach your target weight , you should define two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Have reduced fat , to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional deficiency symptoms ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you begin taking the capsules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember to consult your doctor in advance , if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active during intake and after the intake of all@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • all@@ i may not be taken for longer than 6 months . • If you can not find any reduction in weight after twelve weeks of application by all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in certain circumstances , you need to finish the intake of all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not about changing nutrition at short notice and returning to the old habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without an o@@ ily outlet , sudden or increased stool / soft chair ) can be attributed to the mechanism of action ( see Section 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe allergic reactions • Seri@@ ous allergic reactions occur in the following changes : severe breathing difficulties , swe@@ ats , skin r@@ ashes , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , pal@@ pit@@ ations , vascular collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects do significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , as you may not have reduced the fat content of your diet at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional effects : • Beg@@ in a few days or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you may exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use any unused medicine after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not swallow this in any case . • You can carry your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) , which is included in this pack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overweight has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hypertension , diabetes , heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to feed permanently healthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with each meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which amount is appropriate for you , check out the information below which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the probability of nutrition @-@ related side effects . • You should try to gradually increase your weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ oric intake should allow you to gradually lose weight about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutrition journal with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the all@@ i program for weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat reduction and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ is is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi may be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , since the effects in this age group are not enough information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vom@@ iting ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 18@@ 9 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 19@@ 1 patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued its approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . it was approved by Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ is for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients with am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , caution is advisable with simultaneous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi may not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhibit@@ ed the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic agents investigated by tumours , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ ms and a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors have no significant effect on Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron &apos;s clearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experience of the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present ; therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , the most common side effects were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with al@@ arms , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ session ( 5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the delivery place ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were indicated in post marketing experience reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events were shown as in the other dosage groups ; no dose of activity had to be observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with an al@@ lig@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1.@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and 250 micro@@ gram / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ gram / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life : 7.@@ 3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously in day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; results of the studies with medi@@ cally em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , and the study of chemotherapy @-@ based chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.3 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to an intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro studies for the metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine . pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a unique IV bol@@ ted injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while patients with severe liver dys@@ functions increase the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ions in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose corresponding to the 30@@ x of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ma ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al disease ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages and since al@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results is considered low for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of this permit for the transport must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of the medicine approved within this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

June 2006 the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval of the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called by viral infection ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue damage is damaged , also the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimulates them to form the active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks , and 6 months after the treatment was applied to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after adjusting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease persi@@ sted in more patients than with the reference drug ; furthermore , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine produces an immune response ( i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately validated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected ladies ( tears or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infection may not work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients , whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients at Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo pronounced the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of infected skin @-@ dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home @-@ hours , about 90 % of patients from both groups discussed the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in these two studies Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough for the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( uter@@ ine cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation to the job .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o - infected small La@@ dis@@ ations and abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. to transport Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more , and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation through the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections , in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials in infected open wounds , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infection caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration , if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 to 3 day treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved in humans following topical application on scrat@@ ched skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition can not be expected in vivo ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 Acc@@ ur@@ ally oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on spra@@ yed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity following oral consumption and are insufficient with regard to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should be used only if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to a systemic antibiotic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues or ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effect irritation at the delivery place , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin containing a substance that is isolated from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding Centre and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by binding at this binding site , gl@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ ome sub@@ units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resor@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on lac@@ t@@ ated skin for up to 7 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adults , each before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ unk skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP escap@@ ement .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid gland changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in vitro screening of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was neither male nor female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure to the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of approval for the transport must ensure that a pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( version 6.2 ) and works before the product is marketed and used as long as the product marketed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of approval for the application is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical co @-@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities , as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP agreement with the CH@@ MP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for Product for Human Use , the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with alt@@ ar@@ go if it has not been prescribed to you by your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be applied in sight , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment appears on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gaz@@ ebo unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag containing 0,5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ ani must only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation process and it is ensured that the ino@@ cul@@ ation plan can be run out of two doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , the Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ines authorized since 1996 , and the vacc@@ ines authorized since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same disease , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one vacc@@ ination system consisting of three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month intervals between the two inj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix introduced a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the additional study showed that Ambi@@ ani &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections , which was 12 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ ani ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ing , and irrit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first dose is given at the appointment of the choice , and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is required for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have approached a Hepatitis B vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 As for all vacc@@ ination vacc@@ ines should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic response after the application of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination drug , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibody level is reached , so that in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ines may be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact success in the glut@@ eal muscles , these injection systems should be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ ani can be inj@@ ected in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous way , since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ul@@ us per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it may be assumed that insufficient immune response may be achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ology , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ doses combined vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and intensity on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a basis for calculation per person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pain was observed after the inclusion of Ambi@@ ani at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % in the subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ doses combination drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle reported 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects that had been administered to the Ambi@@ ani , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was comparable to per subject ( i.e. over the entire ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who were Ambi@@ rix received , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination drug ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of pronounced pain and thickness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the vaccine , with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a comparative study at 1 to 11 year @-@ old vacc@@ ines the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that which was observed in conjunction with the 3 @-@ doses combination drug with the alpha @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the share of vacc@@ ines reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination of hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies carried out at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 and including 15 years , the serum conver@@ gence rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the second dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serum conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , in month 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard re@@ combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 year @-@ olds after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units with alpha @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination sim@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibodies could be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given at the same time using a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ul@@ us per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and serum rates similar to previous formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vaccine is examined both before and after the respir@@ ation , to examine any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory accredited to this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transferred through other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by waste water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ is cannot fully protect against infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you / your child are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ inations ( even though you / your child feel uncomfortable or sick ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection against other infections , which damage the liver or cause symptoms , which are similar to those following a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has already occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dosage of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of active hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose , and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection before completion of the vacc@@ ination series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ ani is inj@@ ected under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . if you / your child is weakened by a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child may take additional medicine / take it ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / has been given / or has been planned in the near future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , Ambi@@ ani &apos;s pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women are not given , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ ani Please tell your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • P@@ ain , or discomfort at the punc@@ ture or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headache • appetite deficit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 dos@@ ed doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Well @-@ being , gastro@@ intestinal symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 displaced doses ) are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include locally restricted or extended sur@@ ges that can be it@@ chy or b@@ lower , swelling of the eyes and face , fri@@ ghtened breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flu @-@ like ail@@ ments , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling , loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts , severe headache and stiff@@ ness of the neck , interruption of normal brain functions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impotence inflamm@@ ations of some blood vessels may be discomfort or illness , loss of appetite , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , stomach pain , or increases bleeding or bru@@ ising ( blue spots ) , caused by the decrease of blood plat@@ el@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
23 In@@ form your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you / your child significantly affects you / your child or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les , and in packs of 50 without need@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since the first approval for the market launch , the CH@@ MP with@@ drew the view that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remained positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since Ambi@@ ani was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ mon@@ wealth can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ effec@@ tual en@@ cephal@@ opathy or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia - split to several individual doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed and mixed under food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a comparative study , since ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a head@@ light drug , i.e. without substance ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , effectively prevented ammon@@ ia levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mon@@ wealth was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because the r@@ arity of the disease has only limited information to this drug at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application is indicated in all patients , where a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a late mani@@ um form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first life month ) , there is an indication of the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking account of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium meth@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifested lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ yl@@ ase .
ar@@ gin@@ ine can be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk for the emergence of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and o@@ de@@ formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium meth@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat through the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal reproduction and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses , and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials involving AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) was observed in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 5 month old inf@@ ant , a case of over@@ dose came with an un@@ inten@@ tional single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound , con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) , and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for elimination of excess nitrogen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle may be assumed that sodium meth@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen can be taken for each gram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that diagnosis is early , and treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early @-@ manifested form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st and the disease did lead to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of pregnancy , survival rates were 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with a late mani@@ acs form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) which were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet was 98 % survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to the administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with repeated gifts of oral dos@@ ages of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also examined for cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to different doses , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three individual doses ) the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kidneys within 24 hours , about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , rats no toxic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( infants and children , who still cannot swallow a tablet or treat patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ either or a nas@@ al probe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium meth@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifested lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lics of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , it occurred to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for elimination of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram @-@ taken sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can not ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your lab tests are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass to breast milk and harm your baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , re@@ taining the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency up@@ take of your hospital in order to initiate appropriate treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forget taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , reduced appetite , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , loss of skin , weight gain and anom@@ al@@ ous laboratory values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects do significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date , you may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date and the container . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , and content of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 If your lab tests are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ le ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is run through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Rem@@ ove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon gran@@ ulate . • St@@ range a straight edge such as a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Dis@@ cover the recommended number of measuring spoon gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) for example in unstable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest of different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( an anom@@ aly measured value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack , this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all@@ some gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared to conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox related to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd approval for the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST leverage inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous placement of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI is carried out further , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just before the procedure , a stud rate of 0.5 mg / kg shall be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bus@@ hing of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of an all@@ u@@ sive Bol@@ us @-@ Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied , and is not recommended even if a short PCI interference is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ ted dose should be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ACT @-@ value lies below 225 seconds , a second dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second ultrasound dose to be checked again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Bol@@ us without dose adjustment with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe kidney damage ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients are carefully supervised during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ ant is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the majority of bleeding at arter@@ ial points occur in patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can generally occur throughout the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ant once again reaches the level before the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting from the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregates ) , these substances can increase the risk of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters are checked regularly in each case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both the bi@@ vali@@ ant group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding , as in table 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both light and heavy ble@@ edings did not significantly lower than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : contrac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ at@@ oma of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; spot points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both the bi@@ vali@@ ant group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under bi@@ vali@@ ant , both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported after comprehensive application in practice and are grouped according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ant is immediately ab@@ rupt and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ant , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and in the an@@ ion @-@ bond region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on t@@ inn@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din was able to indu@@ ce ser@@ oton@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients bi@@ vali@@ ant shows a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI was carried out below , an additional bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or ano@@ dis@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST leverage inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or with the PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed across the 3 treatment arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients undergoing 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on four triple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine as pe@@ p@@ tide has a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , the primary metabol@@ ite that results from spl@@ itting the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence is not effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the elimination occurs in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a first order process with a termin@@ ally half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional safety res@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the toxic@@ ity of animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks with exposure to 10 @-@ fold of the clinical ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was limited to excessive pharmac@@ ological effects .
side effects caused by long @-@ term physiological strain as reaction to non @-@ home@@ opathic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure to those in clinical use even at very much higher dosage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use solution is not under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single dose bur@@ sting bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml which are sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a glass bottle of An@@ gi@@ ox and easily sw@@ ung until everything has dissolved , and the solution is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 ml are taken from the glass bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood , or insulin cannot be processed effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ effective human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body can not produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in type 2 diabetes , where insulin is not effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra has been examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ ec@@ onds .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra versus 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin delivery , insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change of the effect , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can result in a change in insulin demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 A insufficient dose or interruption of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based insulin , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these states are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision , and may make a change in dosage necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used , and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , include oral anti@@ diab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzymes , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , under the effect of Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din , and reserve the symptoms of adren@@ aline counter @-@ regulation can be weakened or absent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experiments on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether insulin is transferred into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ≥ 1 / 10 ; frequently : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1000 ; rarely known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , nausea , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is neglected to continuously change the injection unit within the injection area , as a result , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia cells with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropriately trained person or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( in particular by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) , as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster with sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ ine and the duration of the operation is shorter than in wh@@ ey @-@ man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ relevant dosing range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the intake effect , just like human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin , and achieves total glu@@ cos@@ m effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the data , a similar post @-@ den@@ sit@@ em@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved during an application of insulin therapy in 2 minutes before the meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ den@@ sit@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as in human normal insulin is achieved ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine in administration 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin for 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine in administration 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ine that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
