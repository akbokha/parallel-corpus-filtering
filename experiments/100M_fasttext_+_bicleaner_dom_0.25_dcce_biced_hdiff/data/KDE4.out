&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translate the module &apos;s website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , translate menu under Extras website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated instead of the entire URL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; machine translations are very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a crude translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only web@@ pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated by yourself on the Bab@@ el@@ Fish site itself where you can insert too app@@ alling text directly .
package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Set@@ ting Add @-@ ons .... open the cardboard card tools and select the modules you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a list of standard settings from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that some more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crash@@ es . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crash@@ es if available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in visu@@ al@@ ising folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , large files can be easily recognized even if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy . hence , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles useful color and labelling settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched from view color mode , can either display depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file properties such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether there is sufficient space for displaying or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; frames are drawn to display the ne@@ sting of the entries , and these boxes need space that is not available for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , the areas can be divided into columns , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , a room pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , under Extras Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you view the module picture gallery , you open a dialog with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text box , in a text box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition to changing browser and operating system detection for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse access to browsers on the base of Moz@@ illa . for example you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the menu entry ... you can set the amount of information about the browser used , and the operating system in the individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and to download your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view and comment your photos . editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; improved database with significantly more metadata , such as the camera or lens , which can be searched for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of end users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ came ; then we would like to encourage you to questions other users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also visit the digi@@ code , homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have &amp; edited ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here the data file is stored . this path stays the same for all the image folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am create collections &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . no image will be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; endur@@ es the library path in its full depth . you can not exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ box do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and use it as a folder icon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word lists to manage your photos in the albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it may also handle it . support is based on li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ et , and Ro@@ h workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and to download your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) are used for data transfer . the camera is often used as a disk drive . older cameras may also be connected to the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the preview pictures . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be unable to see thumbnails or the creation might be very slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ kam , is how easy it can be extended by modules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to provide K@@ DE Image , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , and digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , over the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filter will only be used for the fields displayed in the file name . thus , filtering on the file name will only work if the viewer view is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; displays a organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly in an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to copy or move an image from an album to another , you can select the photo by moving or copying . in the then appearing menu , you will need to move or copy multiple photos . simply select all photos and move them to the target album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to click the right mouse button on the album and edit the album properties menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
album collections : are a method to select your albums for you to be grouped under a common name . the collection from the collection will be used to sort your photos or view Albums Up to collection . if you want to add or delete new collections please refer to the collections for collections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date , sorted by date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons elders , average , New Year : these place the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file will be used in this folder instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first picture in the album will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album can only be included in a collection , and collections can &apos;t be ne@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collection always includes all photos from the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait short while the thumbnails are generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all thumbnails in the Tools menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information on each image is displayed below the associated preview . which information is , you can change the settings . select the albums page and adjust the thumbnails area to your preferences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview images feature help windows , the appearing . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photograph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . the image editing displays your photos and allows you to create a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing the pictures , slide show or editing the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button . you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by using the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub @-@ menu for the file type . you will find information in the &amp; node ; manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete a photo , it will be moved to the bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move it into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; if you prefer to delete or de@@ f case you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Data List , organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days can be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . hereby you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold out parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list , so that you can easily find the tags you are looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either to &amp; quot ; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be added to the keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can delete a keyword by right @-@ click the keyword and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and drop there . then a menu will appear which gives you the opportunity to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the properties of a keyword by using the right mouse button , and edit the keyword in the keyword menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you must select the image with the right mouse button and select from the context menu As an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the photos you selected with a keyword , click on the keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; . alternatively , you can click on the thumbnails in the tree &amp; quot ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can display a photo with any number of key words . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords from it . in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo - one for the place where the photo was made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have completed a photo with keywords , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you right click the context menu of the photos and select from the menu @-@ menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time beam view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . to select a time frame , click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , the search box is a small lamp that will find the green when the search finds hits . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will find a simple search box as the described above . you can search this search however as a live search that will always filter what you have entered as a search criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be performed . the results will be displayed in the view My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after search , you only need to select the appropriate entry from the view My Search list and select an option in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose to edit search , the form appears to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete Search from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Advanced Search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search for specific fields by &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . an option can be added to this list with search group / etc ... , no ... , no ... or least ... . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digi@@ came ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the un@@ precise search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it down there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sketch : draw @-@ hand paint sketch : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ plug , find the appropriate pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button around a square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window is opened .
from the preview panel you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures . if you are using pairs from the toolbar , use the left mouse button to display it in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the normal soldering operations also work directly from the light table like e.g. F@@ 4 file ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data , for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to preview the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and the &amp; L@@ MB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zoom works just as in other views . just use the zoom control under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will provide you with a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , protect , convert , convert , convert , convert , convert , convert , archive , archive , archive , archive and export image files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Digital continu@@ ance management takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ tioned , packaged , and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ came ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first thing you need to do and know before you maintain anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide if other access to your photos should have to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a bigger drive some@@ day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you might be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be organized quickly via your location . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also recommend that metadata save metadata in the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? added a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos during the further work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now let &apos;s continue with keyword , keyword , as you often say in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then it is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling one sub@@ tree to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to share your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it , start to see some details , people , the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now I say to you this the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming Associ@@ ations . you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who consider your photos the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember the key it is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if the strength has only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) . if you export your images to web galleries , you will not have to tell the story a second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was Earth not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export k@@ ml files that you can virtually reproduce using Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ckr &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and marks the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , i.e. also for the works of others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following description tells you what information in the furnishing page of &amp; digi@@ kam , as information should be stored : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer , or independent commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who is offering the photo . if the picture is a stock photo , then these organizations can be listed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution to this problem is digital water@@ mark . for private persons , this is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . &amp; digi@@ kam , will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : plate errors , plate failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good disks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum@@ ming . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and Linux ; however , there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good capture device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ appropri@@ ated format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and afterwards copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s error rates are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while most electrical devices do not make a lot of power , this can cause serious damage . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not every plug bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection then you should be sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer you should be sure that even all peripheral devices that are connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers supply over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and contain the protection for your modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a few seconds failure can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically shut down battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to even further work until the current runs . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W U@@ PS is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are however very expensive compared to hard drives - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data via the comparatively slow internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) and Fli@@ ckr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . data transmission errors are automatically corrected thanks to the TCP protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred . all of these errors remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have destroyed one day a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at low levels and are highly scalable . it &apos;s open source with many patents and is available under a license for Linux and Leop@@ ard under a GP@@ L compatible license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not a part of the kernel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in not@@ ebooks , and 46 % in work@@ station systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to minor damage , such as theft or re@@ installation . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spotted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture pres@@ ets of fundamental physical limits . it means that while technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer distant from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are moving towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and a high quality optics the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anybody else responsible for data loss . so back up your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you get anything dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system or the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , disaster prevention always does not mean local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , to your office or something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common cause for data loss despite f@@ use is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup , creating a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generate several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup is made . this backup is the next one with the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts - r@@ sync only the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure important pictures directly after saving them on your computer , or a DVD or other optical media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : metadata , IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and metadata , copying images to next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that valuable images will survive the next 40 years that is about the time you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate yourself as the current system is backward . the fewer variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this question should , in fact , be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size , which actually means increasing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . for * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the board if necessary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software exists , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is capable of storing gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved colour assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TI@@ FF has been widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( defl@@ ate ) . a problem is that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open shell format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon will use it sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace Adobe &apos;s XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many photographers prefer to archive the metadata from the image file , mostly in raw format . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation supporting a wide range of operational and business models , discussions and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convert raw files to D@@ NG , and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; edited ; edit , then you should add metadata again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , code them in MPEG , use in Contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the camera interface is not the only way to add your photos in &amp; digi@@ came ; in the section Ad@@ ding a photo to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your own database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; plug , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn on it . you will find a further description in the manual of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you start the camera interface , this will take a while to connect to your camera . if this is the case , the file name and icon for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that are stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Metad@@ ata metadata shows the internal metadata such as if , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata toolbar from the main panel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then the selection of All Download . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download the selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the All Download button , you will see a dialog with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; download the photos from the camera to the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all deleted at once by selecting Del@@ ete All . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera file , you should make sure this is much faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file names will usually be re@@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two relate the information about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want a different date format than standard format , you can use the Pre@@ fix Phot@@ - % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % M . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ kam , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ came ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the page row Metad@@ ata metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automatic rotation is usually enabled , and if your camera does not deliver this information , use the button Advanced and select the Automatic spin in the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if your camera provides information about the date where the photo is made available &amp; digi@@ came ; use this to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case , the photos are saved directly in the target album . if you want to change this , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done &amp; edited ; you where the images are to be uploaded . select the folder you want and click OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this means a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS and the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS or the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ close an area by automatic recording of GPS data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as the direction of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and last through manual input of known places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you need to save this data in a GP@@ X format , because this is the only format that is supported by the geographical assignment module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are different programs for Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phi@@ l Har@@ vey . it uses the characters ha@@ iry coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ google . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ came ; try to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many settings that modify the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standards and copyright data . this data is automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . this data is also written in IP@@ TC fields when downloading from the camera interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for publishers : this field should be the photographer &apos;s job title . these can be names such as a photographer , freelance photographer , or independent , commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the picture . this must not be the author , if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP@@ TC actions are stored in the corresponding IP@@ TC fel@@ der@@ s.@@ This way , metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the &amp; digi@@ kam database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; edited without lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
image lab@@ eling as embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this way your cap@@ tions can also be read from other images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; file extensions of this list can be added and removed . any file in a &amp; edited ; folder folder that has none of these extensions is ignored by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default settings can be reset , by pressing the Update button on the right of each category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some pictures however have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can only get better viewing results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with a darker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the more detailed explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TI@@ FF files can comp@@ ress the defl@@ ate compression algorithm for TI@@ FF pictures . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF pictures . it does not affect the image quality since the defl@@ ate algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you select the loss @-@ free setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this option , resolve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance , based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned into the settings as it displays the pointed white in the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general do not generally react as quickly as green and red . and d@@ rap@@ w therefore attempt to re@@ construct the missing shades of green and red from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you select the re@@ construct option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 , but this can also be done later in the Image Options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a demo a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the sub @-@ raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as a CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after some tests , it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour sof@@ ter correction , since it is performed during raw conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information of a color space to translate into the other is to make the colors as exact as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , if a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color Profile Fol@@ der here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you can save all your profiles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; default source ; for your profiles to be deposited , everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some like e.g. Canon that does not have color mapping or g@@ amma correction . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate , as your image has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can be very saturated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canon profile expansion lets you see the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image manipulation . supported by deplo@@ ying this interface to work with any program supporting the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings short commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the camera features show on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is connected properly , on and in the image display mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path here / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able where you can mount your camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select any name for your camera . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album you will find more details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial changes by the right side bar may be tac@@ itly implemented by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option changes to the right side bar without further queries , you will need to apply the changes to the button changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also display the display of the greeting screen from &amp; digi@@ came ; when starting , this speeds up the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
setting Bei@@ m Start to new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; the base folder to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time from &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder it will prompt you to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; use to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find further information about this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ came ; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to preview and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the ads / Edit menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are part of your distribution as modules . you may find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image editing section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a menu bar at the top and below , the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . none of the features will change the original photo before saving the file Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , you may create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with Save As . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring the original image from the File Rest@@ ore menu . then you lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost any image editing action can be und@@ one or restored . you can und@@ o the last action by modi@@ fying und@@ o or restoring by modi@@ fying restore from the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to make a return and note C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; using the return or restore button in the toolbar one moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ o or restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l , mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you will navigate to the normal view in which you do not want to edit the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can view it in the Edit dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select View from the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or entire sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and choose from the album Export Export wizard . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side bar appear , or disappear into the margin again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications you should consider these limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you commented on it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the application button , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ bet . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time select this and use the context menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency , which follows the scheme in the following table : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with the keyword previously used at this session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search term , so you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this capability is especially useful if you have many keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering key words in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree , all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , please read the keyword filter section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their Album - Date , keyword and search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the top example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is reduced to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword @-@ tree to the selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this search for changes takes place at every start of the program , and it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a rule with and created , and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rule range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can set an extended search across all elements of the database with the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why didn &apos;t pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ckr have not been listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors of your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed and scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web that are out of your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , ink management means that you can make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB color space , ( see below ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your only other image files are email or web , where s@@ R@@ GB is de facto standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB does so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to worry about color management ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB color space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color spaces please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to register my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB color space ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor . if you work in the color space of s@@ R@@ GB , you have to use either your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Balance and Con@@ tr@@ ast Expansion from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try automatically out of your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the luminous density values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright lights and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enlarge contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white balance by &amp; digi@@ kam , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited , since you can work too far from the original image . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it using the menu entry paints white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool .
the thumbnail preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the top right a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful there even in well lit images that display most pixels very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contrast of your results depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to play An@@ stat with the above checks you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color for calculating the color temperature of white balance . this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator will increase the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it in a text file and load it later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pres@@ et button pres@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also show another photo as your original . if you save it your original image will be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool opens the same dialog for editing raw pictures . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another important tool can be found in the menu with color correction . this tool provides an integrated path to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to adjust your settings so that you can always use the same error so you can always use the same correction . in the manual for the sound quality correction you will find further information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very powerful option to correct expos@@ ing problems is the gra@@ dation tool , that you can find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; mould effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of chemical processing , solar isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of a short flash light . the colored , darker areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) , the applied intensity is 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to modify the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can also view the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colours .
if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the inver@@ ted problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation rather than increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex gra@@ dation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma the tool scale correction is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated you will need only the area of the slide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left side represents the dark and the right side , the bright areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls , and make sure that the image changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview becomes dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side are the following options available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often used . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three color pin@@ boards can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , medium and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators which can be used to create the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and loaded again later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , media and sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modify channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel , which is modified by the module : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode is a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker LEDs and that the corresponding image pixels become darker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the preview of the original photos , a red marking is visible . if you want to move this marking to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve showing the original value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you have created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons , automatically set the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and solar tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result only shown in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the edited &amp; digi@@ plug channel mixer , image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison to your own tab .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line will appear in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls for the module are on the right bottom : controls for red , green and construction permit you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance the image will retain the general brightness as the channel mixer will then be THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that doesn &apos;t appear at the same spot in the color channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ads buttons are used exactly for this purpose , so you can save and load any mixer setting for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ formed . preserve the lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film strip with a green lens filter . this looks good with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simulated a black / white film strip with an orange lens filter . this improves scen@@ eries , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter light with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cosmic effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter light with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and enhances the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very similar to the process of the ble@@ aching of a pressure and the revival in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother , similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sc@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam , apply tool texture to apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increase the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; digi@@ plug , add tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put his attention to the image . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . it surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , lined with a nice three dimensional frame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also works at several places if you need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . the bigger the image , the bigger the character set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; use tool template , you can put a template over a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the image editing menu , the image can be used to create templates about a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the template there are no restrictions on size and orientation . you must however use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . just send an email in English to the digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set up your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the root folder has been set for templates appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder refres@@ hes the preview bar of the templates automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the preview , you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse , and check it with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use OK when you want to apply the template to your image , then the image will be adjusted automatically to the preview size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it works more psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it is protected by copyright by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digital@@ ised images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digi@@ ti@@ zing process colours with minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . however , images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sc@@ anners are already using a sharpen@@ ing filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can call it with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sharpen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the most useful technique is to focus on the sharp@@ ness of an image . in general , the most useful technique is to focus on the sharp@@ ness of an image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft character with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting soft draw and experiment a little with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is sharp @-@ mas@@ ked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first try out the effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference amount . in this way , areas with a soft switch between the tones are excluded from the sharp@@ ness and thus avoid beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of blur@@ red mas@@ king filters . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 and amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digi@@ plug , focusing on the tool , re@@ focus a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted de@@ cryp@@ tion filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Film . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ itting has a very long tail , which also depends on the source pixels that are far from the source pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . the values are 0.5 and the values near 1 ; + eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the reduced effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however values higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will add the image further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is most often caused by a previously executed blur@@ red filter . in most cases , you should avoid this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ads buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you set will be saved later , and can then be loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try all cutting , color and intensity corrections to the picture before using the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason is that much operations do not immediately make changes that are not visible immediately , which later leave uncomfortable arti@@ facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made using an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the field correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the slider allows the bl@@ ur of the area to be dark@@ ened , thus creating a more natural pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colour ink allows a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration , and the available preferences are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary subsequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; directional dependence : alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value near 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smooth@@ en &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor over all@@ y. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is going through . normally , here 1 or 2 is sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle step distance da &#91; 5 : 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small you should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal , but it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to leave it out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable picture filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about the sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can remain with the default settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are used per pixel and can smooth the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the focus level . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter picture details will no longer receive and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it can not remove the entire noise or noise peaks . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you change colour or lumin@@ ance density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ ation tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that are typically harder to smoke .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter@@ iness . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised the edges appear smo@@ other . it can remove noise and phase j@@ itter on the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the reduction of noise that you have set , can be saved into the file system and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is luckily much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten the soft character with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting soft draw and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; die &amp; digi@@ kam , photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film @-@ grain , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ sed images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts quot ; - small standards that are in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see how a picture with uniform noise will be restored . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si Camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si Camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were created by scanner lighting and photographic paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows to remove any pictures with a CCD camera , eight have to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality rough @-@ mode photos since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you capture the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . note that the wizard recognizes the last dark image and re@@ charges it automatically in the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image area and the preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
linear : all pixels have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digi@@ ti@@ zing correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ e@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it reduces the corners and edges of the image , reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ing effects can occur through movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and colour or gra@@ y@@ scale field of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners it is possible to simulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a shell filter made without this filter . the tool is protected by copyright by John Walker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ment correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity absorption at the point of greatest density . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , equivalent to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or randomly to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the destination image with these options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the target image , set the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the digi@@ code gra@@ dation ; image editing from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ment correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digi@@ tis@@ ation , l@@ enti@@ cular distortion is a tool to correct the effects of sph@@ erical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of David Ho@@ dson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool works with geometric distortion . color distortion can not be corrected using this tool , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens , and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the third grain has a similar circular effect , but fla@@ ws at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of fourth gra@@ dient correc@@ ts the distant corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , this value controls the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , sound @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corner : this value controls the distortion of the fourth degree . this value acts more strongly on margins than in the center of the image . for most lenses , the &quot; Corner Par@@ ameters &quot; has the reverse character of the parameter general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size , thereby correc@@ ting the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive image shr@@ inks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ligh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sph@@ erical or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . if you re @-@ cut a picture and perform a sound correction , the effect would appear apparent to the groove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Trans@@ forming cutting from the image processing or using the Zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters of film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photographs as the color information is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter applied to a landscape picture from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the sharp@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is well known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver bodies of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film @-@ based effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined look especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; der &amp; digi@@ kam , filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is labeled with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel image is 1 and smooth@@ te 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbohydr@@ ate . the lines that change the outline in the drawing are emphasized . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen yourself to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size , and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving character@@ izes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey and mon@@ strous landscape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look , as if it is seen through glass blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 , the picture is distorted by a different version of glass blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require a long time to calculate , and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ red effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blur@@ red vision : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that run from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixel around a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distance blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens , the object seems to step back into the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random displacement of pixels , thereby simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent uncertainty : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture , blur@@ ring them without changing the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops to your image . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm used by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
dri@@ p size does not allow to change the size of the dri@@ p . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning them into the correct orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo , at a minimum loss of image quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you see the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ be@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Trans@@ form size in the menu and enter the target values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ating was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size , and are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; retain the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used as a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard aug@@ mentation compared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo , use the mouse only the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut out . this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are satisfied with cutting , use the button The crop button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool Fol@@ ding page aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format width is assigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ re , in@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the editing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF data , and not the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the setup aid settings allow you to hide help , so that you can better put your pictures together . these help are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmonic triangle : harmonious formations are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ level rule harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to split a rect@@ angle in similar harmonic tri@@ angles to the diag@@ on@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden mean : the golden centre is a split divided into a variety of natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built their temples and pyrami@@ ds to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden centre provides more liquid relief lines , when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition results in a view of the be@@ holder along the spiral line , creating a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to guide the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the golden tri@@ angles also diver@@ ge from the golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that unlike harmonic tri@@ angles and golden tri@@ angles there are no tri@@ angles .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your picture focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise .
the options horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button Color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do a photo , it &apos;s easy if you do not keep the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture where things are rot@@ ated around an angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the two lines . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic crop function . choose one of the following options :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Anti @-@ Ali@@ ases option smooth@@ s the picture a bit after turning . however , note the above warning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the top left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the trans@@ form@@ ated area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the top right corner : indicates the current angle , in degrees at the top right of the trans@@ form@@ ated area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angle left below : indicates the current angle , in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ form@@ ated area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angle right down : indicates the current angle , in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ form@@ ated area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit sle@@ epy . for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you adapted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with trans@@ formations cut out of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the upper part of the image will be distorted to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
create your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ ills produce twice as much knowing and therefore you should avoid this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with trans@@ formations cut out of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats depend on your system and in some cases the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this occurs on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images , thereby reducing redundant information so as to store image data in a more efficient way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tutorials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be viewed on the Web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go forward to the previously visited album in chron@@ ic@@ le , and you can only go forward if you went back before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; synchron@@ ize the metadata between the database and all files of the current main window . the images inherit the metadata of the database , not unlike in this menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

starts comparing all metadata between the database and all files so not only those in the current view as with this menu . the metadata bank is over@@ written by the data of the files in deviations . the other variant can be started from the menu album .
all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please see the camera section for more information .
K@@ IP@@ I module displays a number of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; edited , and their description follows here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use a uniform dialog type showing the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vertically , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horizontally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vertically , the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original , and the lower section shows the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page toolbar features the essential information about the selected image , and is extensively explained by itself . it is grouped in the following sections : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo characteristics : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button around a square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be used either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Palette Group you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse folders for files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color is described under the pallet view . here , too , the color name can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor over there . then move the mouse while pressed left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box of the cursor is activated under the button Color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ ride is selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection that was created like in the last section , can be used along with the actions copying , tri@@ mming and inser@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colors in the palette , and the output of color selection can be dragged with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a color anywhere on the screen , and then find it in the color cho@@ oser on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; graphs are used in science , in particular in computer science , in particular in inform@@ atics . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; - programs with just a few functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern , user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; node program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphics . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; plac@@ ards ; re @-@ comp@@ utation of the graph and represented in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Po@@ sters ; component to open
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than this node )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ Gra@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of opened files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by factor 10 . below , you can see the maximum magni@@ fication of a graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can adjust the menu item Settings k@@ graph viewer ; see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; graphic viewer , you have the option to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer , or to display the graph in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but later change it with the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the start of the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice and change it later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also set how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph to come on a page are ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ ene without header and with another font
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refresh page gives the option to specify behavior when a file is changed on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or program the program every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Open page allows you to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph ; specify when a graph opens outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior in this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is requested .
the session management page provides the possibility to set the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or define a default behavior at every start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; appears , opens up further possibilities : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website , are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , trying to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ rounded graphs . it produces representations according to the spring@@ y model . it uses the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ rounded graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istic and includes a multi @-@ moon mechanism for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes in a circular way according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then output the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determines the type of graph@@ ene ( judged or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ rounded graphs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also choose the size : the car@@ os for small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read the K@@ IP@@ I module pictures , tools are available to read and save new pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading images from a scanner supported by the san@@ e project or any other source such as video streams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open the screen image , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears as you can replace the default values reduced to select your image . see the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you can see the estimated file size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you have pressed the scan button you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the image file appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . you also need to select the compression and type of the image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image by saving the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have selected the screen@@ shot from the Import menu , you can create screen@@ shots . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read a single window under the mouse , select the complete desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can view other screens and windows . if you select the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay up enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog box appears with the options described above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Fli@@ ckr is an online image manager on the Internet . with Fli@@ ckr it is possible to show your photos to the people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ckr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ckr server on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of creating a token . it is thus quasi your ID to Fli@@ ckr . a browser is started so that you can login to Fli@@ ckr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ckr Website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will see the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ckr . this will be shown in the next section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ckr for the second time is started , you will be welcomed with the following dialog that displays the current access rights . you will also be asked if you want to proceed with these per@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button photos should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . click on the O@@ k button to start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ckr server .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key field can be filled with a separated list of words separated by a comm@@ a , and these are added to the image as keywords during the upload . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as a private . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose the option to select the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic location allows GPS coordinates to be added and edited in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sph@@ erical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image Ge@@ ographical location Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead to a number of previously selected images , with a GPS track . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you must load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the file loads an automatic correlation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera zone must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera display here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera output . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have no trace data from a location for images you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set using this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the location can also be found and set with the shown map . please select the region where you have reached . the height must always be manually selected . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to ensure the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . the option For each image will create a page created a gallery in which each image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all its associated images . select a folder where you have permission to write . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab preview images allow you to customize some of the settings from the album Ri@@ der for the thumbnails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a progress window displays the user on how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if errors have occurred while generating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I viewer viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or moving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start , a picture will be displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ Free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module allows to store images in JPEG format below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you wish to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image dialog with which you want to copy the metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function does not work with all formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please check out ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . with this module , you can choose the DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you need to select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start creating the module using extras MPEG @-@ Sli@@ deshow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images selected by you are listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the images or the content of the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you &apos;re planning the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is indicated . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a lower value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should set it black . you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind the extension mp@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then you can start the production of the movie with the button code encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the button on the right bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically printed with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ rap@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : d@@ cra@@ w does not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings for the white balance should be used . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information on your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise use it otherwise , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the trigger button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing a single image , which are the best settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , start number and time stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions , the aspect ratio is changed at this option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; printing preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images with a file selection dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also drag images to the picture list , and then add them to the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to remove images , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your email client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t make sure to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations to the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images , your configuration will be saved and repeatedly used until you change it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting comments in an enclosed file , comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the P@@ NG format under the P@@ NG file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files but it is best adapted to loss @-@ free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and not change the photo quality . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original export dates will be added to the images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions like you want to show your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Open@@ GL option in the presentation will enable very elegant transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have an appropriate graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a continuous loop . afterwards , you can manually cancel it with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order . thus , the order of the pictures in the album is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . so , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . by chance , between images select another effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this toolbar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop slide show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the lower left edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE work@@ space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now present in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories that have entered information when you have typ@@ ed your images and videos . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course check the actual thumbnails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select another person , only the images on which both persons are shown . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on some single pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can display thumbnails to view images of your sphere of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of her name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display images beside the names , select the button on the right of the toolbar . in the context menu you can select which view you can view for each category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you must select the image pane window ( described in detail ) and select the image view window . in the check window , you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you access searches in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter a string in the label or description field , you can also enter a date searching for it ; the date can either be part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can search all pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but prefer to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to the &amp; k@@ photo@@ album homepage ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the Demo , if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time launch , or select some sample images from the menu and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the &amp; k@@ photo@@ album homepage ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you data about the images in your database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can view the displayed items Pre@@ view View from the database ( if you select a date the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane ) and the time line will always display the current date of the currently viewed images when you navigate in preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the HTML menu ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before HTML pages you need to create some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , enter the title of the title and a description which will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , that all pictures are from a party . for example , all pictures are exported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most custom@@ isation options are clear , which is why they are not addressed specifically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images . this allows you to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set . so , he can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best to select a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . here , you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these really are all visible for viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder a web browser will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings you have just described have all three based on base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may , of course , create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can have all images together and share this file independently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the Export File ... or with HTML pages , see , Cre@@ ate . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described which you can view through the Export Graphi@@ cs menu ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Man@@ ually option near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Automati@@ cally Copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . as most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the im@@ porting file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called in your database . therefore you will be asked in the third dialog window what categories of the file to be imported and what categories they match in your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of the file to be imported into the categories of your current database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to look at pictures and see : if you look at pictures , you often want to see pictures of your holiday in Italy and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this manual , you will pass through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , over ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in case you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; use the -@@ c option , as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .@@ x@@ ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will learn the different settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call the F1 button and click on the option you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can specify different properties , e.g. people , places and keywords for each picture . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Options dialog , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a group as explained in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , you will find a list of the current category and on the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . for more information , please visit the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the modules are used by multiple applications in common , you can always test new modules with the demo database before using the demo database using the command &gt; craw@@ l _ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simul@@ ates and photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it will be the category you have defined in the creation dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you are using the category individuals , you will do so , so if you would have selected persons to view and pass on to the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window where you can browse your image database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the image etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section below . if you want , you can see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , since you can always use them again if you enter information about your images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , so that the names used are moved upwards , find people faster and assign them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to view an alphab@@ etically sorted list , click on the list for sorting by date under the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a group , a special icon is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry into an existing or new super@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition you can simply drag an entry into a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub @-@ category of this entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the upper edge of the frame , and you can also create your own window by dra@@ gging it outside the window pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... that offers you the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and click here to hide the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select images in your browser , you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images , or all images , if you don &apos;t have a filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as a background image for your desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on a picture , this will appear in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete , or select Del@@ ete the Del@@ ete key or select the Edit menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course you have to use the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumbnails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , you need to copy files from folders and copy them back . so if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid mess@@ aging of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can select the images that your little sister may see and lock the menu entry All except current view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you set out which images should be hidden in case of your little sister . if you want to give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy Settings menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file index@@ .@@ x@@ ml will only be able to view the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe them hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime . this is why &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture and video viewer . this allows you to start from preview as described in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer can see you in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all information you have to enter via the picture , e.g. who is on the picture when and where was it done , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons high and picture down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . as often a new image loads can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and Plus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom out . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out The Plus key zo@@ oms into the center of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the Sync key set the zoom , so that each pixel is on the screen a pixel of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the only zoom operations that work with videos , that in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Notes from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can specify a feature where the characters A , B and C are set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have attributes to your images , they are available in your browser . so if you have all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview window . if you select categories in dre preview , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the characters for the character after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will be allowed &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to turn the painting from the context menu , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; do not have to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and shown the object in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ al view yellow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all the objects are already selected with the object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the item menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to choose the right position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with dele@@ tion either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to accept these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; enter user documentation in setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview of the properties view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the whole texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse button , thus change the position and direction of the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a transformation is chosen disappear the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and viewing properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also store several window arrangements and simply switch between different layouts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to anchor a window over or under an existing view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to view multiple views over one another , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking the tabs at the top of the views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing to the top left in the fas@@ cia bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current window view can be saved with view window arrangement ... Save a dialog , where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full@@ screen images of the highest quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the render icon in the toolbar or select View R@@ ender Mode ... , the following dialog will be opened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small portion of the image , select the section section sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used to render . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive because the depth of the pixels depends on the calculated colour values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels using super @-@ sampling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
case of abs ( r . 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually pursued and can be checked for further sub@@ divisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on J@@ it@@ tering change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays did not hit any object .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly , you can find the reason for it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Copy and In@@ sert in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . set the path to your retention and version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ tim@@ etry data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colour of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view , and in the window @-@ type license plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects like the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections . this property creates a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value in the R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new windows orders . in the window orders section explains how to create and store windows orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combination panel standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of present window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement , you can create with the button Add and delete a select arrangement with the Del@@ ete button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each window arrangement is identified by the name , the name must be unique and must not be empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list under the name displays all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ ors the window under the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ ors the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide you should create the ultimate but simple scene under beginners very popular : a sphere at one level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you should carefully consider the following warnings before you can only obtain a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering as a result you get a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not insert sources of light , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have installed everything fau@@ lt@@ lessly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will have to use these menus and icons now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . you now have a scene without objects .
the clin@@ cher model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when you click on it you see the content of the view object properties in which you can find the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera ; this is reserved for later instructions but notice that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the Apply button or the input key , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a j@@ ader ( insert end@@ able bodies Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an intri@@ cate method to solve this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can insert an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise one unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both cases , a dialog opens where you can choose how to paste the object . the pigment is then displayed in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you see how the pigment looks right now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the pigment shows only a matt black material because you can still type settings for the pigment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and the ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then enter the preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the color list you will need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree , choose plain and change colors in the view of the object properties : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should be able to do this step by simply , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; the ball is just as easy to create as the ground : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the view of the object properties you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the button or the button apply ) , otherwise the ball would float above the ground because you moved the bottom to one unit down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the rendering now produces a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , place a suitable material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as in the ground , give the sphere a pigment as color : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name , for example , in ball Pig@@ ment . click on Sphere Pig@@ ment , then select one @-@ color and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots , and click Apply or press En@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the she@@ en effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities for you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ tracing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er a scene , ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a camera , you &apos;ll see nothing , the camera is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you created before using &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved memory are dis@@ car@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can only select this entry , if you haven &apos;t saved any changes in the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repe@@ ats the last re@@ done command . this menu entry can only be selected , if you do not use Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or over@@ write an existing arrangement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and default behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . with this option , you can add default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; modify or add new commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eb@@ er ; add and remove tool symbols .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map , as well as a texture map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by using a picture file as a color card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images can be displayed either in a separate window , in the size of the image or in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n , or the Return key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can adjust whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for a certain file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three of these , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this point is activated , load &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already see the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay , when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged for large images on the full screen . this option is enabled as default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
determine if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and one window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumbnails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
magni@@ fies the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the entry field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ came ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and modifications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to it , reports at least problems and possible improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ casing then we would like to encourage you to answer the user mail@@ ing@@ list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for entering the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ foto ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; try to give as much control over his work sequences as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; you can choose between them in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exposure indicators field , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view them in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images , which no longer makes pictures to scan and save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and save images , or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; channels ; using the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog box for selecting the scanner is opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , and press OK to open the scanner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) , these options are not particularly handled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a preview is displayed in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . if it is pressed , the image will be saved and you will get back to the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the Settings button , the dialog with the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be displayed before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; channels ; images save for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , you must select Save without asking for a file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the images are stored after each scan , this folder is used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time being uploaded . the character string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; manual . the button over starts the K@@ DE through dialog for &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; the button Settings will display the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite .

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; use like any other program short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global key short@@ cut lets you set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting short@@ commands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands , making your keyboard a &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ aro@@ k supports command @-@ line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Am@@ aro@@ k also has some command @-@ line options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialogue to allow the user to know why a script is not running .

in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your script data with Am@@ aro@@ k and control Am@@ aro@@ k . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command ; which should include any K@@ DE installation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is mostly used . here is an example in Python : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this reason scripts are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course a script can ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data every script itself needs to worry about . when a script is started Am@@ aro@@ k sets the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is being played . the script now could ask for more information on the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the unit length ) .

before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; or when the user stops a script sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Am@@ aro@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension cat@@ amar@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main critic must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if your script package is ready you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Am@@ aro@@ k category ; scripts .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you will only search for a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s Collection Browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you might have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right choice for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Am@@ aro@@ k has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod Nano i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Am@@ aro@@ k is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to re@@ discover your music !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , in the base folder of the Am@@ aro@@ k sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Am@@ aro@@ k : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; node ; mailing lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable to compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled for them to be used . see the System Requirements section for details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be setup without effort using setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; display the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available , if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the V@@ oting bar@@ ometer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; design : this function is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . thus , the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mood files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; if this setting is enabled .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , when a browser is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you exit jQuery Video Play@@ list , you will automatically save the current playlist when you exit &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , use &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to keep the current piece visible in the piece change , the playlist window is up / down to keep the running piece always in the visible window area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when changing the context browser , automatically switch the context browser as soon as the next play is played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the font section , you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue playback at startup , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start automatically continue playback with the piece it has been stopped at the last stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first option is font . click Select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use your own colors to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces will open the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the default &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering into plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Display option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can set on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio @-@ card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box , and some drivers also activate further adjustment options in this cardboard card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cardboard card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of the database for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recur@@ sive sub@@ folders : this causes , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , as well as their sub @-@ folders to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ see Chan@@ ges : enables &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ y- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination panel driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected another setup is necessary in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; on the computer : will enter the database on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use username : and password : to enter the data , which are needed for the connection to the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pay@@ load card loads the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send plays , and update the profile : this setting makes it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
get a similar interpreter : after activating this setting &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Am@@ aro@@ k needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by posting in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . then you can delete the file that caused the crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , Tag@@ li@@ b crash@@ es when reading the met@@ a info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit more mature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , but compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this leads to crash@@ es when editing met@@ a information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open during a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; use _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; $ v@@ 2@@ tag ( amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ an app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ an app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map . please check if Am@@ aro@@ k uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ an app _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ fying Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the installation problems are ligh@@ test by the help of an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error , if there is something about the correction of an error in Am@@ aro@@ k itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , only a blank playlist will appear . how will there be music pieces there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is simple . use the file browser on the left , and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ up window has been converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extras Statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to rate pieces you have to see the rating column in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Am@@ aro@@ k is in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From playlist from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and let them fall , just as you would do it with other files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the playlist . click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel program . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . look also for lib@@ visual and this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ isations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . besides , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence the real question must be which media types supports G@@ stra@@ amer / x@@ ine / MAS / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders can be supplied ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver with the Al@@ sa sink the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different ink ( e.g. , sink ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not forget that media need to be deco@@ ded first , you just can hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try this ( exit Am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download open m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with gst @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please report to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . in your calendar program , set an alarm and run with the alarm this command : D@@ CO@@ P Am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command lets &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up by the soft sounds of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to get the current title in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; when you are on a different computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Am@@ aro@@ k player @-@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k window . press d on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size of changeable windows .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button puts a piece in the click row in the queue . pressing the key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the title of a browser , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Am@@ aro@@ k , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive or use Am@@ aro@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Q@@ String List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String conversion ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , this fits the previous rating with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall score . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can edit the rating for one piece by using the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then , you can edit the rating of a piece as well , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ k . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that cannot be put together with the short @-@ term plan of Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a new feature in Am@@ aro@@ k , which some users can also find annoying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select the toolbar , and select the desired changes there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Am@@ aro@@ k ... appearance Con@@ text browser design , click on New Design to install .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the icon was similar to the War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ ors navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . then click the Settings button ( the top one ) and select Am@@ aro@@ k from the drop @-@ down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crash@@ es and a lot of bug reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; newly installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably , use a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to compile and install x@@ ine de@@ vel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking . it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I receive the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then restart Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Am@@ aro@@ k use the second sound@@ card ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting up Am@@ aro@@ k ... Audio output specify the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a onboard AC@@ 97 Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w @-@ audio } type h@@ w @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check on sound card support m@@ map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry , but the audio edition with Arts will not be looked after . you may of course like to take this issue yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for Arts : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . if you want to upgrade your collection , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , this Quick Start Guide should help you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them by saving the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is in the folder of your collection , you are already in the tree view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click an entry with the right mouse button , and follow the Bur@@ n menu . you have different options for burning a CD here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed that make working with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; more enjoyable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the toolbar you can find a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not meet your search criteria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can get music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now , you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the playlist is longer than space in the window , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play . as soon as you enter letters , you will only see the pieces that contain the characters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter by spaces separated by spaces , search &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , enter all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination ) will be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller searches . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces which have a higher rating than 50 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ somewhat searches for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces which either include Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired order . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you find the button Add where you can add the playlist pieces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , follow the return and restore buttons . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the time of the current play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also hide the status bar , and disable the status bar in the General Settings dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of one artist in your collection , by selecting the artist on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have more control over the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to add a piece in the playlist and then click on + . you can also easily add the pieces to the playlist , or change the context menu in the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ set ( the details to set up these will follow later ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , adding other random pieces while playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : audio @-@ cro@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double click on the playlist , drag it to the playlist window or right click on you and then select Download . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two pre @-@ set modes Add @-@ in mix and playlist mix immediately complete your playlist and you can add at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will be added at the end of the first piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ fill the current playlist and add new pieces in accordance with the dynamic mode . edit the playlist to edit the playlist , and you can change the corresponding settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the number of pieces added after each played piece to the playlist . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script , and then click on Set@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can install new &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k scripts by clicking on script . a new script will open in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete from then click Un@@ install . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dialog window Visu@@ alization Plugins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin just enable the check box next to the name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will be able to get a slower quality when encoding it . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a los@@ sy format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible burning settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b website is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback on community help from the forums and learn news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ in @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; and therefore el@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; but a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA , Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis deco@@ ders and enco@@ der modules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . advertisement is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ MA@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums may result in the unpleasant effect that the music pieces will be reproduced lou@@ dly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD , and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Store is displayed , with which you can select folder and file name for the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closes the current project . if a project is changed and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has happened . you can then dis@@ miss the closing and keep the project open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project not stored , just as if you had called for each project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each project not saved , you will be asked what to do with it as if you have called the file Connect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if the current project is a data CD , the so added files appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Bur@@ n , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the right mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from an earlier session into the current project . this is useful if you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is more useful for you to see the files and folders that are already existing on the media .
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the medium ; it only displays the previously imported files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively you can only create a copy of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog . the converting / c@@ aching of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , allowing the content to be completely deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools like N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data which can then be burned instantly by pressing the button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the used video , encoding settings , and even ways to change the size and cut black edges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the disk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opens a dialog box to modify the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key allocation to it below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . thus , the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations can be set for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this chapter , we assume you are using the D@@ CO@@ P command line program . in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void PA@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b - K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project across the command line using # D@@ CO@@ P k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void add@@ res@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ res@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void setting volume ID ( Q@@ String path ) void set volume ID ( Q@@ String )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; readers can easily read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . also , other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that code these WAV files ( compressed ) . more enco@@ ders can still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( generally one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as loss @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ able ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids protection it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . just avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while setting up needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of the user interface will be explained ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work fully without network , with all the information collected manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . by step , for example , you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the CD@@ DB enquiry comes from CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starts reading , and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings in the setup directory - encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ der so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it is to be noted that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the Settings dialog in the setup dialog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the file manager , so that an already used file to code will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read out and add . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( like logs , pi@@ pe@@ as ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the main creation dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like enco@@ ders , to set up the enco@@ ders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to FLA@@ C , there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , publicity is provided free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + High to very high sound quality ( with high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG recording devices is present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices like standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people , most of the music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR . compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo equipment with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR compression rate about 5.5 . needs more than 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without considering the file size , then select this setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or automatically retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example to add titles to titles ( english : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with lame the switch -@@ t@@ t of lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can download the audio CDs , which information can be downloaded instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : this is the author ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( send an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address used in the system . in this type of configuration it appears that the email address is not used when calling the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more about it in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the applicable Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get further information about his switch by entering a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can have many causes . check the device description of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives that are installed both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio encoding of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check , if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ proof audio CD ; to read out , check the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write per@@ missions on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for any read @-@ out &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to compression the music ( lame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them from any read out of a &amp; CD ; change if the right settings are found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device name is handed over to the reading program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces can be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not much to do here . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example , everything is shown / entered exactly as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with incomplete information can be selected , so that you will be informed when information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD , data automatically downloaded from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : the machine must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately when you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter the database , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b if you want to download the database beforehand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for data request for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server through the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . place everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both work equally well as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of simultaneously explo@@ iting pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to throw the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must the path / folder be stored in which the files are stored in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything just as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something to the right must be smooth@@ ed to see everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier this is a setting for very good audio quality even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of WAV files at the same time : with dual core or quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each read out of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD is running ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , is described in the previous section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have a &amp; CD ; use not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; so you will learn how to collect data manually , rather than repe@@ ating them from the internet . comments will point out the differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , now the &amp; CD has to be pushed into the drive defined in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this does not happen , then check the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window , and you can select the database entry that is best suited to your &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you do not have selected the check box for the automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database but get the data from the Internet you need the connection to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor , entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen@@ shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; ; the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comment field can be used for individual comment@@ aries per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments which apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words begin with capital letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats . see the help to the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data that we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way , until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the part list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked in this way will be read . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected or press the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on the button selection to start reading the reading process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and track what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . in the left upper half of the window , it is directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message tells you if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folders ? ; - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it is clear why the error has occurred right after the end of the first piece &apos;s reading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new record : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it &apos;s now improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded , and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . resp@@ . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section is aimed at persons who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package from their distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various tabs of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , still on the read ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first time start of the program ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program boot ) , or from an unusually short menu ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who reads this , probably started the program . it should look like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke playing player by &amp; k@@ de ; besides others it has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real@@ time high@@ lighting some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system and should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver who is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

drag &amp; drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to C@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you finish playing a song , K@@ Mid will start with the same song again next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you can select open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with several songs at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the toolbar , select the play from the menu piece or press the space bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the template and thus change the playback speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , pressing the space bar like a push on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu piece , interrup@@ ts playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics and others do both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can select which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will be automatically determined by selecting a song , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to specify an event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also includes buttons 1 and 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summari@@ ze . this section shows how you can use collections efficiently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy , and then specify the name for the new collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the selected items in the collection manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to do not want to add to any other collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that when you add many pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when the piece is opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to skip a song , choose the next song next song , select the next song from the menu or hit the arrow to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to jump back a song , select the button Pre@@ dic@@ ated piece , the item Previous piece from the menu piece or press the key arrow to the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in the events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet player if originally a piano should play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only have one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all Sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all required implement@@ ations for playing a piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ ONS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ ONS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not General MIDI compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . general use is as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) ; you may not change the order and don &apos;t leave any line for one of the 128 instruments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that this instrument needs to note on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each tone represents a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are shown on a certain channel or instrument , the use is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the rows is very important , as is the presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can define several key maps for each channel , each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Key@@ maps are used to map sounds on the percussion channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , make sure that you are in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option the Key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel . in this case the patch x will always be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio specifies in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied with the value n , this is converted to the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is needed because GM pres@@ umes that a pitch will play a pitch with the value 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , some key@@ boards are trying to play two tones up to an oc@@ tave higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you will find this in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view is a window with a full set of pian@@ os ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards , you see which sounds are currently playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) two different views , to show the played notes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this is because &amp; k@@ mid ; to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , so support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or if I want to play a file ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , switch off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then you decide to play B.@@ S@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to write further to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year so I do not have much spare time for my hob@@ bies but I try to collect MIDI files and make music and pro@@ positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact my friends by &amp; k@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to make money for it , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Sol@@ ving the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my thanks also applies Jose Lu@@ z San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul WIT@@ TA , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ tho@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who has sent me a patch , error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , my thanks go to all these excellent musicians on the web that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you need to compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ Name , was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for additional help , please check the website The K@@ DE Website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window only when information is returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category of permanent playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the different files in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all changes are lost when the processing mode is left , or another group is selected without the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically finished by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end animation , so the user can finish the application a second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the ad of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; In directory testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L the by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; supported .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ sc@@ c file like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; playing with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even add the special field to YouTube in the playlist XML .
so the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages must be the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be used in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , this must always be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c file . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on will play all o@@ gg files : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . in addition , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europa ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be functional only on the first screen ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dv@@ d@@ utch source , dv@@ d@@ source , source source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , start playing the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are there hints as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter , when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is root after plug@@ ging the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be tested for performance every time ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it is likely to be applied to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; ki@@ le ; Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling , and are included on the box ; -@@ website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual is for anyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced users must not read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact over the box should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; on or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed at the mailing list box @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .@@ net@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; box ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical user interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made approach to all &amp; latex ; -@@ Reference and powerful project management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual should be drawn to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start working here directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate ; start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for &amp; latex ; is the right expression : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to operate it is also possible to use a lay@@ man ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it originates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is only a good overview of &amp; latex ; given here , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduction contains at least the \ \ \ &apos; document } command with the \ \ \ &apos; document } command , and must be closed with the \ \ \ \ Docum@@ ent command command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the quick @-@ entry wizard from &amp; ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document classes : this defines the type of document to be created , Articles ( Newsletter &#93; , Articles ( Newsletter &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; promotional &#93; , or custom @-@ defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
encoding : this is used to set the code encoding . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . in the best case U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ Docum@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for &amp; latex ; for integration , they only have to be selected in the check box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; articles ( DIN ) , Articles ( DIN ) , Articles ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions , and further information is given in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you often notice that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it can be saved by the modest appearance of the output file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ \ command } ) , an empty line ( for instance \ \ \ \ command } ) is automatically generated ( e.g. \ \ &quot; command } ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows to sub@@ divide the document into the following elements ( part is the most common , and the sub@@ divided element ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI file is created , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a DVI file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the commercial output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting a paragraph , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ cked , becomes the corresponding passage in DVI ; -@@ viewer spec@@ kled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , working with others is simplified . a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings when using a project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quick build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file is located on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selection fields were developed for fast entry of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick classification of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other options are available for items such as keywords , joints , or references . the options available are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name : with this command , a term is created for a section , an image or a different element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written by hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ v@@ e is used for defining the font sizes . it is possible to specify the font sizes for the main text , the joints , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two options are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brackets are defined according to the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu structure or the rapid structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling , and ki@@ le ; for storing it automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the document comp@@ iler fails , logging should be searched for errors . when using fast assembly &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , logging should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is handled differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the changes are only done within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , you can add certain fonts , grease pressure , cour@@ ty@@ ards , sub@@ missions , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
\ \ start { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the short pressure and is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed it@@ ali@@ c with \ \ tempo { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ start { percentage } and ends with \ \ &apos; { quote } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex source , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ in or C@@ tr@@ l E can be converted back to the editor ( for internal viewer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try out and have fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for legi@@ bility of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF trans@@ formers or computer screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI you can print the document by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the toolbar allows the transformation of the DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . once the DVI file has been created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the search query enables direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . for this purpose , only Modern will have to set up ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select the preferred search , the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked to the search search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document by &amp; ki@@ le ; open and set to the corresponding line . this must be set in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is no error in case of using quick assembly of the &amp; DVI ; if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the log file always specifies the error source in the source code . in the editor , there is always the line in which the error appears . to view the defective line , click on the error in the logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; navig@@ ating to the faulty line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when choosing empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or used for quick creation of a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hands @-@ fi@@ ge users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new template , either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file or create a new file . &amp; box ; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document from a template with a new file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing coding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ fle@@ eting $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , then the template can be selected instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files will be created in a simple way for creating a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; uses &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about ads and its possibilities , the hand@@ book should be consul@@ ted on K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le can start working here directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; latex command reference that can be called for the La@@ Te@@ X Reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use and its syntax .
a double @-@ click button to select the &amp; tex ; this means that clicking the \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; box ; has the possibility to browse different types of source code and emphasize them . for example , the standard text and the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is a special kind of book@@ mark within the text . the menu edit jumps , or the corresponding keys are highlighted , so that it is automatically retri@@ eved when entering a character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; functions added ; lots of environments and groups , and therefore supports &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this extended meaning is not meant to include tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also holds &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a character font ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a part of the document , this first can be selected and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers its own commands for faster possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le , is contained in the description to edit a paragraph paragraph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; for this reason , &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit conditions for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ \ &apos; environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the over@@ look can be lost quickly . this command is the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers also special commands for &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . among Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly closing clamp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing clamp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cursor is located before or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ Group # , the other end of the group is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering a number of ne@@ sted welded group par@@ enth@@ eses , the over@@ look can quickly be lost . this command is the most recently opened group , so that the wa@@ x@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex is not destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; latex ; use two simple instructions for use . the character is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic entry of the double output characters can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can also be used for custom settings ( for example , in German or French ) and thus German or French approach symbols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a spread@@ sheet environment , close &amp; tilt ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an enclosed line break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be til@@ ted under Settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) ; searches &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the next row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering a good source code completion it has been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; three modes are added for use and the other two are available for automatic execution . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings box ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when starting a new environment using the \ \ \ { environment } command , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when pressing the button , the last letter of the input will be removed and the result list is removed . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , jump marks can be inserted , so an easy jump to these positions can be inserted via the Edit jump mark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings can be set up ; setting up ... ki@@ le ; adjustments can be made to these lists . it can be selected by different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and latex ; -@@ commands , as well as languages of the general language use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . on the other hand , a large list with \ \ start is necessary . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the execution of environments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command to open the environment automatically and then appears \ \ start { . after that , the ambient completion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . as soon as it detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Settings box ; set up ... ki@@ le ; adjustments can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of default options for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lists can be set up under Settings box . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , contains the file L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is introduced over the processing of permanent or key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt key key , the character L will be replaced by the character chain \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big screen printers are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been noted that many stores are written more than once in a document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be set up in the menu Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be fully extended . here , the threshold value can be specified for displaying the execution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ tional home folder . mode stands for ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the graphics incorporate graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be able to examine the results of the work , compile the source code . all construction tools are comp@@ iling in groups in the creation compilation , creation of converting and creating view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , or the further transformation can be the key individual Alt ; 2 , using Alt ; 4 into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the Quick@@ work command , a viewer is usually called after the comp@@ iler . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , each time a new window will open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new project is asked about the project project New Project .... This is where you will find the following information for the project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the script function of &amp; ki@@ le , allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be administr@@ ated from scripts in vertical bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the API scripts are not yet finished , and can be added in further versions of &amp; ki@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; latex ; is a fairly extended system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents , included in the documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; latex ; reference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; box ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; ki@@ le , then only the results are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double @-@ click on the mouse , or the space bar button open the viewer for the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . using the command @-@ line interface you can create random signature or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is from &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for day signatures , the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new signature , choose C@@ tr@@ l ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section , please save your signature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use emails for private or professional use , there are always enough signatures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File Rem@@ ove or click the icon with the red cross to remove the toolbar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all call stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower the frame number . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on a call stack in the shown list , the cursor in the main window will be moved to the corresponding file number of the corresponding file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use Kom@@ i as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked well , knows what it &apos;s like . if we raise it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! simply cli@@ cked on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on and done ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application expects a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the open working folder , then leave the current job folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time that poll@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said , everyone who worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the just opened file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then you simply select the current job folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to an issue on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well formed , click Well @-@ formed Ch@@ ecker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D , specified in the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the definition UR@@ I ; file selection required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file to be processed is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by using the other file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specify the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; otherwise the plug @-@ in system will benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the plug in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we start editing the plug @-@ ins . this opens the following dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog enables to manage all plug@@ ins contained and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI , element in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , one can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze as pressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ names and setting their own identity are important in terms of messages and comments , see for further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information about the team leaders when something is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project or sending a message when a file is backed up or a script that inv@@ ades a file as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties Di@@ alo@@ ges can create , edit and delete events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an e @-@ mail is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be either the comment -@@ entry from the editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment field followed by comment text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , which is the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member , should be given a role in the project from the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up by configur@@ ing Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers some pages , which are treated one after the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed with this . the entries are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags automatically inserted , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optional tags automatically include : when ha@@ ked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this is immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not include optional tags : as above , for all other tags except for simple tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically update start and finish date : when turned on , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automatic setting of accents : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for identification of different types of files . using the default button , the default settings can be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; default character encoding : encoding of newly created files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting is removed from the same into the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly , so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reset the default window settings to the default when the user interface has been changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings , by hooks of no longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in split mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , whereas empty groups are such as no element was found in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means , there may be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ ender abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input : this information will be given to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied loading . only @-@ read parts usually refuse to load , if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the inserted information is correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging has been completely re@@ designed , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented which allows various implement@@ ations to plug @-@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us user interface : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed , usually appears in the left dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view in which all holding points , listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view where the output ( like in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown , usually appears in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this action uses the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging demands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sends an HTTP request to the server to de@@ duce a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started , the script will start with the request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . if a request is given , the execution begins once a request is made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , without entering into the functions or include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , although it is possible to fix in functions and include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next one , as if there were not the current . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that can be found on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works by Keith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes how to customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to suit your needs , and how to help you get better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; its simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer easy to use and productive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tag Fol@@ ders contain two file types , the Tag folder and the toolbar . tag Fol@@ ders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on converting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool lists . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog ; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . file lists allow quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a sp@@ elling error .
tag Fol@@ ders are nothing but a folder . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag Fol@@ ders carry the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version . ( for example : html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information in working with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and limitations , is explained in a simple way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything else than one element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the class class only . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag , which is a single element type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
describes a tag attribute . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is a just element type element .
prints the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , a section name and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a container tag grouped together the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is a single element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available once for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each box ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined , and this element is a single element type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specifies a list of elements that finish a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spaces should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and check tag X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is only performed when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , an example of a functioning family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; U@@ ber function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; option &quot; / lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for editing DT@@ D editing . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = sol@@ sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an action can be set with settings to specify actions ... click New action , to the same dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assigned short@@ cut , assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , you can assign a short@@ cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered into the defined settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but there@@ on it is not limited ) , which may change the document or use parts of the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / scripts / Qu@@ anta / scripts / Qu@@ anta / scripts / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; % f : we have replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs ; this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is used by the external script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; input can be specified in the default input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script , and the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the default error output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set up actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory , pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fill out all the necessary fields , and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; tag &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it , before we have trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a symbol , that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly regarded as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least notify a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will be inserted ; tag in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after creating the symbol , it must be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with settings to specify actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press the application button and continue with other tags , so there are those , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us functions to the toolbar , or set it to a better overview by some Tren@@ ner in multiple groups . make sure the toolbar is selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note , how the Tren@@ ner supports group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ box could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new toolbar has to be tested by half of all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure in the correct folder . after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most not@@ orious extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository , if someone has already done it for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tags 2 = func@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP documentation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents = inet@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the depth of chess ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out for yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
spaces do not affect anything but look for &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a simple list of mixed context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and go to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / do@@ c for local and global use . then create a folder ( as indicated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners , or anyone else . at different locations there is an email @-@ sending menu entry like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resources can be uploaded to our main archive from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing what is needed for a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when up@@ loading you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) and the tool@@ bars toolbar in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource is warning and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . it is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definition command : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / html 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor to be adapted with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand them and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use brow@@ sed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is stored . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool lists , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to toolbar with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building views , the tabs with information and the tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or run CVS commands to the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right click in the editor area to create a further context menu related to processed document contents , such as editing / copy / paste the file , when the character string is called under the cursor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the top end of the editor is the toolbar of the editor . at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as the standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presentation with card holders are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; global templates are always available ; local templates are only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . it allows changing all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by adding a folder do@@ c to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and edited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tab shows information about each DT@@ D running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . display them on a symbol and they are displayed to the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ box in an email you can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and don &apos;t run here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure this is not older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before its bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; node ; developer community is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to increase productivity dramatically . using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions and scripts and tool@@ bars it is possible to increase productivity dramatically . through the program Kom@@ ges@@ she can expand it &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze any scrip@@ ting language tax . ( read more about it in . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development , and has been developed quickly to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more in the details of the documentation is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon &apos;s sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look at the templates section . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board so that it is correctly displayed and mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Shi@@ p which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first of all for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP , script error messages are issued ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays the message window , or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script tak@@ ings and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raising and switching problem re@@ porters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , as soon as one changes to the structure tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries forecast or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project , and the selected files will then be copied to the project directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; searches for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loads a project tool bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars , and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dialog to save your tool lists . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; removes a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone can access it . see in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load a &amp; DT@@ D ; , which you or someone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are eliminated from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present fails the load fails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu Standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bars is denied if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on posters ; -@@ Version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know people using other OS platforms to develop , choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instant switching between the different types of the user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries it can sometimes need time or unpleasant graphics . it is recommended that the card index mode is , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this menu provides one entry for each open sub @-@ window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the status bar is displayed at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , main window is switched on or off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the changes in this dialog affects any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you will find details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog appears , where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and change the sequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form they find here the way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed from top to bottom , for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can enter the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled out automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , adjustment could be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project , and multiple files or entire folders can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a project is started from scratch , don &apos;t hook up files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection of good man@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by tick or , by removing the tick , exclude from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last screen of the new Project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . in the menu with project properties in the menu tree , upload profiles or change the Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant , and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows you to select the de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set in the sub @-@ window , as well as displaying a tree view for each profile , by pointing a specific tree view for each profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event configuration can be used to activate event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed if a previously specific event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour can not be influenced at present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to open another project choose to open project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project manager gives free access to the files in the project , where the files can be managed in the current project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders are also behave , but the entries are missing and open ... in the right mouse @-@ click context menu : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be hidden to prevent removal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password will be kept in the kernel memory , and if you forget it , this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk save option is not available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will stop the transfer , or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high load profiles can be created so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . this dialog will be displayed when editing or creating a profile :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the server &apos;s name , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . in a project there can be many views , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted on the project tool bar in the Project or Project toolbar , accessible , opened or deleted using the Tool@@ bar project toolbar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has to do most . this not only increases productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own working method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as mentioned above are toolbar buttons in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way to use the toolbar menu . use and add differ . adding tool lists is treated in the section Ad@@ ding tool lists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , which can be used to remove tool bar , ren@@ ame tool@@ bars or toolbar buttons , which can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool lists and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool bar ... and set Settings menu , set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons as well as code sni@@ ps and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy and move the existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you set up for the file system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . binary templates are usually included in documents using im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . usually more special documents are created in corresponding sub@@ folders . you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in a corresponding way .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template but the same text area again and again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the templates tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , aggreg@@ ated in a compressed tar archive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File To Save As Local Tem@@ plate ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once that is done , note that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select Text in your document and click File How to save a selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with dra@@ gging and dropping onto the tree view templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and dropping or inser@@ ting the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select in the file tree or in project file tree view to a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented procedure . you can create he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically connect them with &amp; PHP . in addition , you can keep track of some things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files contained in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a regular folder , the b@@ lah would be explicitly enabled in this path . if nothing appears , it would probably be in a root folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows pre@@ compiled or updated text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and enables a whole presentation to be equipped with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers through copy of content templates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second tells the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol to edit the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are displayed in sync in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor can be set between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the time interval can be set between synchronization after one click or automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the document properties dialog will also be called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style sheet , pressing the file @-@ open button and select the corresponding file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cursor is like in a word processor , due to moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the insertion of tags is made in the same way through the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other surrounding tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some tool lists such as the tables assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet design can be tra@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to successfully compile and compile the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a file name without path . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded styl@@ us file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is for example loaded a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command checks for a partial or entire match with a pre@@ age named QNA@@ ME , or a specified mode name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

multiple commands require more than one argument . quote characters can be used to give composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; an argument is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are lots of graphical tools to compare . so , why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected a lot of text in many places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no hint at the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions were added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a full @-@ value file browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merging : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; sz@@ lig 3 ; displays the exact differences and refers to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check the code , you will like this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no longer h@@ ass@@ le when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make ti@@ pping work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening dialog will allow manual typing of file names , selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the button Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merging folders will be introduced for B and C , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if merging is enabled , the input field is enabled for the target and can be processed . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately set an output file . you can do this step later when you save it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the setting button opens a dialog with Settings . here , you can set options before you start merging / merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and drop it over a comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text in a comparison window is supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program than cut and paste text ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B , C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the path to a file is too long , allow the mouse to rest over the line for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three source windows are labeled A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a difference is detected , you can see the color different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vertical line , which separates the sum@@ p column from the text , is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line will be displayed on the broken lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has a info line with the wording Output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have edited the result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts have been resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to find the remaining / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time must also be solved manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this text appears neither in the final file , nor in a marking that you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text &amp; lt ; however , in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window , be careful with this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the number of numbers ignor@@ ing ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can also use the arrow keys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the display window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( Str@@ g @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Image Move Up / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Image Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy the marking to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insertion ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line feed + line feed + line feed + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line ends of the source files , therefore you should not use binary files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when moving , and restored at the next start . ( set menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is enabled , the number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is enabled , the clip@@ board is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer for saving , the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when comparing files , white characters are ignored . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart returns &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others may be displayed with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is down@@ lighted . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow in very large files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in automatic ski@@ pping mode , this setting defines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automatically solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you do this only from time to time then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ solved white conflicts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options are handled in the chapter for scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge , look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ or@@ g. if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ or@@ g. it will be deleted without further securing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change of this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to exit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above the code fields for encoding , a short notice appears what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the encoding is individually configur@@ able for each file , even files can be compared and merged with different coding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
switch off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply blend the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you see the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ merge the merge file the name of the last source file will be retained . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file , it is first given to that external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is only used for the line balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line counting to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &quot; .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while using sed experim@@ enting , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you might like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line balance . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character is replaced by nothing but practically er@@ ased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once , then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from one another . example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement of per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merging . other operations only change the data , which the new@@ line algorithm looks like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders in it@@ ali@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; for each object , make a suggestion for merging ; you can adjust the proposal before starting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes , without real@@ ising them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to open folders on the command line , or in the file dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that only the comparison of folders does not start merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of the current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files listed until then are listed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when scanning the folder , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each file and folder that was found during the scan , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or double the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will start and a comparison window appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then , folders have the same color . with folders the age is irrelevant for its color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the du@@ b@@ bing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option is synchron@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copy &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during merging one file will be processed after the other . it shows skill when merging is successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected , K@@ Def@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or mer@@ cen@@ ary ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : if you have not specified a destination folder , it is used in the three folder merge mode C as the target and B and / or B will be used as the target while syn@@ cing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries in the destination folder should be displayed in the folder structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to merge all entries , start directory merge / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) to merge : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merging actions , a message appears on the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options Cre@@ ating , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select Sim@@ ulate when you first want to see what would happen , without making the real changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are done with a file , start / resume directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the list , you will have the possibility to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before you proceed with merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries will not be merged . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , ( Set Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only files that fit on the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .@@ or@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .@@ or@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS too . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a hide attribute . in other file systems a previous point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the option is enabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links display . this is down@@ lighted in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
links to folders : when the option is turned off the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on the links are treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that a link to a folder that contains a link itself would lead to a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es . ) This option is disabled in default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern ) . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , you might want to compare only the change date and file size . please use this speed advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the files are considered identical if they are equal , for example , when copying the modification date has been lost . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enable sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging files are stored in both folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are any differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as an action instead of merging . ( this is assumed to be uns@@ af@@ e because the other file is not modified too . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file with the .@@ Greg@@ g extension exists , this option is also switched on in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the folder merge view stays visible while merging single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the folder and text window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also merge a single file directly from the merging menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be deleted and the file will not be merged once you run the folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this status is lost , however , if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : read@@ more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a local FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things , you should note : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a path may be relative . or .. included . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the Con@@ fi@@ dence of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main purpose is currently being a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Def@@ 3 press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part show from the context menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diffusion 2 already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by st@@ owed in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or let him go that way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably not shared the proper pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effort for this has so far been too great . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger volumes of text , another editor should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c has been released , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . for this , please use another editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all functions of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , distribution : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir provides the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) paste the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current marker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in the current program version , you must re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only entries will show that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , it will fail after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ line in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces to change their size to end or move them . this works both within a desktop and at several .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other work surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background by &amp; p@@ ager , the context menu and the names of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maximize , On Desktop and Finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is enabled , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will display the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tick this box to display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is enabled together with name , the names will be provided with file numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; p@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be specified here : classi@@ cally Le@@ ave &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a horizontal row , all virtual work@@ spaces appear in a vertical row , which is very well suited to the display on the side of the desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
der &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , and select a switch to set up switch ... let the dialog display settings appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . but you can do this manually : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / c@@ pag@@ gu@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file you must register as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must register the key win@@ dow@@ transparency mode and assign it to this . possible values are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the pack@@ et k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly updated to include new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can add a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ let mode ) or the area of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to avoid the mouse cursor in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fication window . this is also done with the arrow keys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection box . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner to move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against zero . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; gt ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and smaller &amp; etc ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cursor continues for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetition Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , because of the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to clarify it again , even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps prevent pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse , wait for the end of the move , before releasing the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dwell time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently move is switched on , the time of rotation will be activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this motion will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .t@@ xt , but will be changed later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce response time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and tab . there is a slider Sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at the moment it is only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will reset to the stand after the last pressing of users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is best to use and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be disabled first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , you should be aware of which points a mouse click is without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or at places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , you need to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be quickly clear when you view the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the ball , you need to see the reels . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and move a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution for this problem is that you run even a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor over where you want it . but leave the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy and paste text to the clip@@ board . but it will probably only cause problems with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use the smart move , if you just start using a mouse click and hold the Shift key down while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , you know exactly when the shift time starts when you move smart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X windows needs to be installed . this should be the case in most systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available , if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome , which causes pain to be pressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to start a pulling process before the mouse button is released . in this way dra@@ gging and dropping using the mouse can be done .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a program that allows silent users to speak their computer for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer talk for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course phrases that should be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second page , select the default text folder . you can select the text passages often used without typing them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main window of &amp; C@@ mouth ; is clear and contains basically an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have used k@@ mouth ; correctly set , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu entry . this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the word completion and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the input field of the card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box under the input field , place the drawing encoding to pass the text to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a passage passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a passage in the Text passages menu or in the playlist for text passages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of instant messages , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the second drop down of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text passages log should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you choose to make changes , the text passages log will not be saved . select Pre@@ ferences , will be &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text folder is to be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word dictionary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the entry field , you can select the dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this source , select the language you want ; &amp; C@@ mouth ; the frequency of individual words is simply retri@@ eved by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , you can bring together the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can either add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either using the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the sequence of text passages or passages of text by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the default memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is selected , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by clicking on the toolbar left and dra@@ gging , the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by clicking on the toolbar left and dra@@ gging , the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you probably did not enter the command for the voice output correctly or not fully . open the Settings menu , and enter the command for voice output on the box map . ( see Settings dialog for Voice Synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is a language edition system of the University Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that a festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show an example for the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA to use for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax like to swallow the last character of the text , so an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Microsoft - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be turned on .
the voice output da@@ em@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the setting of the language generator is only performed in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use ts@@ ta@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to set up , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Setup dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an application that can not be used to print text by the computer . a list of already generated sentences is stored , which allows the user to recover again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that you don &apos;t include a language synthes@@ izer . on the computer , a language synthes@@ izer must be installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or address bar , or launch k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; node ; programmer ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS abilities .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; posters ; even if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other &amp; node applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech output is done through the program of speech @-@ dispens@@ ers , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows to generate language expenditure on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; support program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and set up kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , for reading texts from a web page or parts thereof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can use it , you will need to install and adjust the program of the app . see also : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the flash@@ card is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer drivers for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the tab tra@@ cker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the flash@@ card will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all already configured speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on one of these buttons , to make your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and female voice to choose from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click here , the new speaker appears on the flash@@ card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can use &amp; dict@@ ts ; go back to the map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled to read text . click on the card orders to create and manage text orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice dispens@@ ing system by &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check this check box to enable the &amp; t@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , you can create and read text orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , it is running , and on , if the field activation field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears once the read is complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with buttons in this row , you can start , pause , pause , pause and resume text orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; node ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for one job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be adopted on all pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . then select the text you want to read , and select the text output from the main menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Po@@ sters ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text that is supposed to be read , and select the text you want to read in the main menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this works even if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications , such as eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Qu@@ ote is the &amp; k@@ de message system , which informs you about events that you have set . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; point ; read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can set up a message in which your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; dict@@ ts ; you can then read IR@@ C message text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ ori@@ fy , a menu entry message appears in the Settings menu of this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; t , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; dict@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; dict@@ ts , filters are not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the program of speech dispens@@ ers . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed following the issue of warning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order you commission from the card orders is a text@@ book . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have special ur@@ gency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader while &amp; t@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and terminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . they are applied to normal al@@ arms , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
character string sett@@ lers replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . it is supplied with pre@@ defined character string sett@@ les which allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the delivery of &amp; t@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with subscri@@ ber selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the flash@@ card reader , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text to the next filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a warning message is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were created on the page . the processing by the filter takes place in the list from top to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just needs to differ from the names of the other filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string . the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key while clicking on the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text is from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can get the application ID running programs with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; you must om@@ it the &amp; D@@ Bus ; if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the string collection filter is applied to the text only if all conditions correspond to one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when comparing words , the string sett@@ ler filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this manual you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ formers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the speaker selection filter you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set up on the flash@@ card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before &amp; dict@@ at@@ edly , there is a narr@@ ator for the text . the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker features , which sends the text to &amp; dict@@ ts ; the speaker selection filter can be over@@ written with the speaker selection filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve a faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specify the properties of the speaker you are looking for . if the text comp@@ lies with the filter conditions above , the speaker is selected to match the required requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to store or load your voice settings , or to delete all settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthesis synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so &amp; dict@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus , from the program kt@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open two &amp; console windows . start punc@@ ts@@ d in a window , then t@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one of the mentioned language synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML , re@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able even if you do not use this voice for reading websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain notes or punc@@ tu@@ tions seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string release filter . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive you can download the package . here you can download the source code from k@@ de@@ bu@@ st@@ ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with each language synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated , so check the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Platform Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthesis . if you want to expand and use another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but it is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have downloaded the source code from the source archive for dic@@ tion@@ aries or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you make use of the shell script , check whether you want to use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf using your language synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that the installation of the tool dispens@@ er is possible directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can rec@@ la@@ im typing , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , this will be used , otherwise it will automatically be the best matching speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the Add button on the card list , and there@@ with a speaker can be inserted into the list or click Edit , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the character encoding for text , which is passed to festival . in case of voices that are &amp; dict@@ ts , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display them grey , the voice chosen will not allow you to adjust these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so ( with greater memory usage ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on Apply ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , the program window is only visible in the system section , but not the program window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed in the order that is selected in the list below , forward or backward . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click the audio file audio . see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , only text orders are listed and administr@@ ated . issues of screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; dict@@ ts ; either un@@ loaded without support for the corresponding audio module ; it can not load the necessary libraries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are no output modules in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the speech speed here . 50 free ; % equal to the half and 200@@ 0.@@ 0 % such as double normal speech speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; Desktop .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning notices the next higher priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you read a long text on a website , you can still welcome someone who enters the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; dict@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this audio file is played whenever a normal text job is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read with &amp; dict@@ ts ; read Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check this check box to turn &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and you don &apos;t read al@@ erts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is selected , noti@@ fications for which a sound is played , by &amp; dict@@ ts ; not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this event reads the message , the conversation and conversation , if someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; dict@@ ts ; ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use this drop down menu to specify what &amp; dict@@ ts ; if an event occurs , you have the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown on the list on the flash@@ card as the top entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the messages in a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , it supports &amp; dict@@ ts ; SS@@ ML is only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! Doc@@ type speak PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; ht@@ t@@ p . &quot; who has slept in my bed ?
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual phrases . this allows you to skip or stop orders quickly with the pre @-@ read as only the first set can be synthes@@ ized or stopped and ab@@ ort even if the voice synthesis synthes@@ izer is not directly supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first start of &amp; t , a set of rules can be set automatically . you can change its settings or add another set of rules , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply turn on the subscri@@ ber &apos;s selection and select text for reading . if you switch the subscri@@ ber selection , change some properties and check how you have set up the speaker . otherwise , the filter will have to be in@@ effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; t@@ ts ; then be able to start reading faster , as only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these reasons , the normal set limit filter will automatically be set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
define text with a regular expression for sentences and insert a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set of boundaries preserves the character set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ett@@ les ) , warnings , messages , or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the standard set limit filter from Ver@@ see , you can paste it again by charging the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the card card word selection , you can over@@ write the language settings for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use of the default speaker ( the top on the flash@@ card speaker ) . in other words , no speaking abilities are specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the most appropriate speaker that displays all the features of a subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , follow these actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enter the desired speech properties , select the method you want to enter by clicking on one of the buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this property does not matter , enter nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mark this check box , if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this property if you know that a particular application is sent text in a different language than that is set in the working environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all the features in the speaker area , which corresponds to the following , click the default speaker button and then use on a speaker , which corresponds to the following . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , entering 0 is required ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crash@@ es when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get traceability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , G@@ Stre@@ amer is probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I get a text order free@@ zes &amp; dict@@ ts ; a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts can occur in AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it at festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice to the developer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work the program must be so@@ x installed and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card card for speaking devices . depending on the chosen voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed will be ignored if &amp; dict@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because the HTML will be converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very courageous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not create websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; dict@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that the festival does not produce an error , the x@@ s@@ l file will reject the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I added an own string collection filter , and now I can go back or forth in &amp; t . on the tab jobs is displayed , the order consists of only one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may not filter the punc@@ ture marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . for these signs use a filter for set boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system counts , you can not simultaneously play music and start a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de still does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have downloaded tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , register as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following modules for voice synthesis are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Debian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Debian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs compiled from sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you use , check first if your voice synthesis is working properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must install at least one language . help is provided in the instructions provided by the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software at festival / li@@ b / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to input the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look at the CDs of your distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , encoding must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice delivery system is . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival generates this by &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 it is not necessary to re@@ compile the error corrections ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual work the correct path in / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / .
this procedure uses special code to issue the language over festival with a Czech &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; get out and install first Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both of them work . then download Festival Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your P@@ AT@@ H .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ ly voice synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor voice speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command module enables you to use &amp; dict@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; command line can be controlled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best use a command to write the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured in order to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and setting the network features possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , installing and setup drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option is set to network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that matches the distribution and the release date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . previously , all options are gray shown , which means changing the settings is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the rider network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... in the dialog device .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the automatic mode the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode the TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will not be required for any system start .
with the manual you can set the TCP / IP configuration without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching on a switched @-@ off network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network devices can be enabled or disabled , depending on your needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specifies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communications with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org then DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed in the list with buttons down or down in the priority list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on the button Add ... from group hosts to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... the Edit dialog will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list Nam@@ ingly well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at bo@@ oting if no DNS servers are available . in small and closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the list Nam@@ ally known hosts contain some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the IP address of the known computer , and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias names , press the button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of a name known by name from the list , and select Edit .... The dialog Know@@ n machines will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings made in the network settings are not immediately implemented in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for installing binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package , and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface like a package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; Co . not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second one is discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; edi@@ table configuration files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be medi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found great dissem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently focuss@@ ed on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important information is knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in other networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point , which can be used as a valid IP address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a designated area specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a dedicated lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this part , there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this file is sometimes changed dynamically in DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if any other content can be found there in case of active DSL connections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to send emails from the rest of the program to another , as the normal address &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes are made only when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable to remove . then proceed to edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can also click the variable and select En@@ able . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only become active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears the default node ; - Print dialog . if you choose to fold out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the schedules of the users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to learn time and date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ch@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first consisted in creating a surface for tar that offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick and selective packing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a band can be used , it needs to be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tape returns and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . don &apos;t detect the tape on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; detect &amp; ch@@ dat ; the pre@@ split , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if everything went smoothly , it changes the tape drive to indicate that the tape was inserted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by fli@@ pping the entry for the tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before throwing the tape , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by changing the symbol for the tape , indicates that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; node ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you start format@@ ting tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after entering the tape name and capacity , proceed with format@@ ting the tape . after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click on the local file tree , and select the Save ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can still check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog will display the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Veri@@ fy ....
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the test process has been started , the dialog will display settings for checking . in this dialog , you can even check your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog displays the progress of the examination process , as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can initiate restore , the files that should be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be recovered .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select Rest@@ ore ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog will display settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have confirmed the restore settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index in two ways from the tape :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings , and you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current job folder , where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all files listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are stored like the folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the button files &amp; quot ; lt ; lt ; lt ; files , at the time of creating this documentation , have not yet been fully implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up over the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu , you can make the following settings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will be loaded to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the option turned on , tried &amp; ch@@ dat ; to lock the discharge from tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is enabled , loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; node ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you need to report the block size for your tape drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; node ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one block on the tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( n Byte ) The tape id . the format of this string is a machine name : seconds ; the machine name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remaining files on the tape are plain tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who cannot know where to get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stored the different protocol files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log , a number of useful functions . these include : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after startup , you try to open the most important log file of the system - the system log will not appear , and it will not appear with system administrator privileges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string . in default , a log line will be displayed next to the filter entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in the log file system log , select the column process and then enter the name of a process in the protocol file system protocol , so you can specify all log lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is enabled in default , and helps you recognize the key protocol lines . log lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of level hint . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to display the process identification ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , this may be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the SA@@ MBA server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can activate the Add new lines in the main window context menu to view all new added log lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you can find more up @-@ to @-@ date information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for the control of the system boot when up@@ loading the system in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not go further into historical aspects , e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V in@@ it , without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. d@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want to boot during boot up or change to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial which can only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it , and starts the first one he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning section , you should see a line like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix it by restart the system and execute the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how does it start now all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually run these scripts manually on the command line like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K contains , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could also have a run@@ level server that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; starting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between round levels or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this only does not happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : entries will be moved when you move them to a new one . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target zone of the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sor@@ ter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting again to insert the system service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash , so be careful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move an entry into another round level , move it with cut out to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the sor@@ ter number or the name of an entry manually , press the button to open the properties dialog . use the Tab key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine is constantly re@@ started . what can I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programmes of these distri@@ butions , but does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available ( and if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without a message when their configuration files are not present or false .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ time so that you can add this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either you may use the corresponding toolbar icon or entry in the File menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window consists of two tabs , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . if you have limited space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , you will create a card on which you can make individual settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password management password management appears if there are shadow passwords , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as installed in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this card only appears if for at least one fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user parameter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem , with limited space restriction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ aries group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the matching Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , remove and change the boot password , remove the boot password , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
