<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous density values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">"" "" "" "it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="392">"" "" "" "automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright lights and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="393">Enlarge contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">"" "" "" "white balance by & digikam, is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="395">"" "" "" "the white balance correction is slightly limited, since you can work too far from the original image. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, your options for correction will be better." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it using the menu entry paints white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the top right a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there even in well lit images that display most pixels very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">"" "" "" "the contrast of your results depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above checks you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color for calculating the color temperature of white balance. this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">"" "" "" "in addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu with color correction. this tool provides an integrated path to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to adjust your settings so that you can always use the same error so you can always use the same correction. in the manual for the sound quality correction you will find further information.</seg>

<seg id="410">"" "" "" "the & digicame; mould effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="411">"" "" "" "in times of chemical processing, solar isation, also called Sabatier, was an effect of a short flash light. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper from the additional light." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="412">"" "" "" "with approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible. another upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="413">"" "" "" "this is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2), the applied intensity is 30%." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to modify the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can also view the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colours.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the inverted problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation rather than increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma the tool scale correction is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated you will need only the area of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area." "" "" "" the left side represents the dark and the right side, the bright areas. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="421">"" "" "" "the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls, and make sure that the image changes." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images require a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the digitizing process colours with minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper.

<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want to boot during boot up or change to another runlevel. system services do not include such things such as setserial which can only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
