&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies and danced to American music , American authors read and run his sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter a fear@@ less re@@ porter who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was like it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was only reinforced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I even had written a very shy love letter about his size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so nicely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says exactly what he thinks , how a former colleague expresses it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in flocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 million votes gained by the Repub@@ lican Pres@@ idential elections was the highest number , which had ever reached a candidate nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people , whom I met during my time in Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for example , Professor Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of Journ@@ alism Program , which welcomes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even Tr@@ ump@@ et Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung did not agree with the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ umps In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for their lives the environment , and their husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she still fits the Com@@ mit@@ ment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me get used to the complexity of American life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there were Andrew aks , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Tr@@ ump cleared his way to the nominated repub@@ lican presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , broke my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ er as ra@@ cists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my friends , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and implies an inability to understand those who act and think differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most know , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented on the cruel decision to impose a man who look down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different from him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( equivalent of the White vs. all other ethnic groups ) ; the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash ( White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash ) , as it did the great Van Jones , has exactly killed what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America means everyone welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this country elected as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd was br@@ ittle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices sounded lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ iced &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is now Tr@@ ump Land , the message said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ gic city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the music played at both venues not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music , living with the waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the congregation of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , a music school with 100 students became central interest in O@@ ax@@ aca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young band members take their commitments towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they always come smiling and with shining eyes and play in the tur@@ f you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clar@@ inet , obo@@ e , flute , horn , tim@@ esc@@ ado , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7.@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - on instruments made of recycled material :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recycl@@ ers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion produced from the tr@@ ash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them were not living with their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something , which he had never seen before : a violin made from waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a documentary names called &quot; land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ er@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year , the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est , as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music , around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orchestra , even before Pope Francis , played his music : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re @-@ release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of content .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , it was known at the time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it searched the other coast of Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the East African countries were angry and little inclined to welcome a criminal offen@@ ders of this kind to their coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed swiftly against the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that were simply denied everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay USD 2 million to Liberia , because of pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded by F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and interact with each other where illegal fishing goes , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , hence it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships very attentive , when they move on the open sea via satellite data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in banned areas , such as those who indicate that a ship will load his caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideally , such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay the pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue which will lose eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world , including illegal fishermen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things are actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licence papers , identification of f@@ anci@@ ful species , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criminal networks have uncovered criminal networks distributed in Tanzania . ships , who used frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , discovered ships and found and found fle@@ eting ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he builds a system , helping F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious vessels more precisely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track down illegal ships who like to hide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position . &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that combines different levels of information . it aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal acting ships with greater precision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a model program
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and allows the position of each trac@@ eable vessel to be displayed worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; join the neighbours to get a better picture of who doing what is doing , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not just criminals , but also deter them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ships previously exploited without a license and hardly expected consequences , now know they are being watched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board their use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . . &quot; with certainty , the goal of making even more of these initiatives and structures in other regions is to be created , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 found a ship under false flag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ship had also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to intensi@@ fy : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the resignation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the government rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes to negotiate on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( example : Venezuela &apos;s ref@@ unds ) , both demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des @-@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation wor@@ sens continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately it was blocked by the official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine holds the chance to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prot@@ esters called Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Party ) in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces to support the National Assembly on the 27th of October as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civilian strike and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the programme &quot; The Rec@@ ession of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images of the mar@@ ches published in real @-@ time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most widely shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries from this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , pictures , which tell about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ alities do not have ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that forms the scale of suppression per day : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the dictatorship has oppressed the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an administrative procedure , which has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many people on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and preferred to keep critical voices silent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they took us so much , but also the fear ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an adap@@ table version of an interview from Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interview was translated into English , and is published here with friendly permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cor@@ doba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were perpet@@ rated during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 34 years , he kept the family secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis himself had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Service Department 141 in the prison La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who before a federal court testified against his own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his story shows how great power a parent has over his child , and how this child chose a path of redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told my father about him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pass only that they will not escape you one day , and I must save you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me , I would become a secret agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok , for so my father had educated me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , simply everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tortured &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he took me the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , he pointed to an open space and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the prisoners are tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I se@@ wed in , and saw a lying on which men were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I found out that they fast@@ ened the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they rarely enter a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , shot him with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sten@@ ch there in there was terrible , like a dirty win@@ dle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years later when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized the smell immediately , and I realized that the smell of a body is in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never could forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; I knew that these people were killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were facing down with the face - they were all tied in hands and feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people compla@@ ined quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were thrown into a pit , and killed and buried by soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , because my father told me about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Pal@@ ito , Rom@@ ero , killed a man and killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survivors , the Civil ist Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , accused the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the way you came in here is also the way , where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this road and then were tortured for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies , in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when I was later by the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yields are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military insignia that one fought an enemy that was fought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you go to a house and steal the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie , and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You , who hated cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , beating me and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for that , we don &apos;t need anyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my father .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can load me on what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , I was there to testify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last disgu@@ sting act &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one develops further , realizing that it is false to kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship , but why would the corp@@ ses be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do children ent@@ ail ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could , however , simply put them into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill those people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did these people not even have families , to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last disgu@@ sting act that one can do to a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed humans ! &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to clarify it , I have nothing against the military . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to show my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the atro@@ cities I had to experience , I had to blame him for all the atro@@ cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and in@@ quired what the entire exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed humans !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to take part in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , I got the first ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , I realized that he was a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally told my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , still before the end of the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 counts of crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of imprisonment in 15@@ 4 cases , torture in 98 cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Spanish , the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity , in 28 cases sentenced to life imprisonment , and in nine cases prison sentences were sentenced between 2 and 14 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven of the first 54 def@@ endants died during the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # La@@ Perm judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ stat@@ er@@ ror@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 , and brought to La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for years for justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization , created in 1995 , representing the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the process took more than three years , but the search for it took 39 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government transferred the country to La Per@@ la to build a memorial , which is now managed by human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

adaptation of original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , witnessed a particularly failed translation last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word ( kor@@ ean below ) , which &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means , fal@@ sely - perhaps also with malicious rear @-@ thought and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wrong translation was on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself , from 1 to 20 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adaptation of Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; how could this translate into such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture excuse for the translation error . furthermore she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; elderly mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ porter named by name brought comments to the light released on Yahoo , which shows what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to lift against older drivers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If the translation is incorrect , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia

there are many reasons for the wide spread of translation errors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to translate , one needs two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - should not be native speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still produce translations in the company . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; machine translations are also widely used , often with funny results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ verb@@ s and mysterious sentences , created by machine translations , show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints , often adorned with t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery , but of large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards can be expected more carefully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Venezuela : protest and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ ajo con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad ; Institute for Press and Society ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would have no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the Executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis Juan Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cut , and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : enabled your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ el@@ an ISP are again locked .
this is from the @ vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing , that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fel@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website of which the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers use DNS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will reply fla@@ wed or refuses to request such a website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was set on Thursday 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera operator El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who was carrying out the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was taken into custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fl@@ ores was beaten , while he was in police custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also sign@@ alled the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to obtain education &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mean tas as well as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the shortened version of a sculp@@ tural report , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , falling Schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride talking about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ mean for the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children do not have to pay for it innumerable days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after gradu@@ ating from her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she talked with Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated to cri@@ cket guarantees silence in general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption &quot; declared Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is , on the one hand , the family who have their daughter in faith that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the family adop@@ ts the girl and whose exploitation with faith justi@@ fies that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl is ill @-@ treated , his family will experience it many years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , they never know about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon that is taking place in sec@@ rec@@ y in Paraguay &apos;s households , but a face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent put@@ ts . shortly after she died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the home of the former military nav@@ al Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo working as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with just 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society bl@@ amed practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest meetings , and demanded that there should be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without papers , it is much easier to violate the rights of children un@@ punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to monitor under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbours of the married couple , and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the case occurs , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ mean
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign up bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their brothers now had to go to work , and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ mean in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time so that you also had time to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every morning , she rose up at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time for learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also this time was limited , because she had to make supp@@ er for her employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the master &apos;s library as eating out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power from 1954 to 1989 , to the opposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read articles from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considered them intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would return to &quot; bad habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had enabled her to lose again , she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she was completely clear that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing that almost never was said are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ mean when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ mean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school , or in the neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my youth , during the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clear that I was not part of any group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job ads for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for learning .
please do not hesitate to contact us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the interior , who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the display in the display switched on once again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you , I am writing again if something is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ mean tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Cri@@ mean tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mean tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors ) were ens@@ la@@ ved in a system of slavery , where they become light sacrifice for abuse and exploitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft legislation on the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up in order to grant citizens a permission to grant social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with the acceptance of the law , users would have to register with their proper names and identity numbers in order to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fin@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application running through the internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose registration . it is also unclear how to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ arian and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Technology , blocking Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . on account of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they forci@@ bly control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , that means they can set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who need permission or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before entering the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament where control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the parliamentary deputy Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment sentence was intended to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold has been published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq the Tibetan women H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian Leop@@ ard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , are among the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; is the Persian Leop@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and the thri@@ ft of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ard actually in the wild game is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his works have been published in numerous international publications , including TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT magazines , Washington Post and The New York Times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meyer filmed films for National Ge@@ ographic , P@@ BS , CN@@ N and H@@ BO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the competent daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress that was hit by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a number of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast which had experienced both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring frac@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal towns disappear from the map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has even experienced a nuclear accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special report by K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years after , in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority , as well as survey results of those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( in the south ) in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma uses 70 percent of the final light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of accommodation is still trying to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2016 more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 was still in emergency situations , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tives concerned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident were affected extensively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has been largely re@@ covering , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma goes far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , however , can only have 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers have lost their livel@@ ihood since the catastrophe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to establish an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents find that still not enough was done in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also a witness to the worst , disaster @-@ caused , nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture of 160@@ ,000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the 2017 exhibition , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are forced to compete with massive construction projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people come across from other countries that speak another language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely to these global connections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ on@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i explains how love for music has strengthened the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences collected in a small village in Madagascar .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer took him against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors operated him this Saturday , and now moved him to an artificial coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread within a few days quickly in Brazil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the pictures , the police officer &apos;s face was also identified with a stick attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás noted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation by the active ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures show police officers how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ eur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video captured by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ ters soon ha@@ sten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another video filmed with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus who live in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he was a member of the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has hit him with a stick on his face .
police attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police officers in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , made rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers across the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , the Brazilian media tra@@ cked street protests by guiding the focus on another , unexpected protag@@ onist : a window washer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported a broken glass window , illustr@@ ating a photograph of their website pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a story story with a bus set on fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window slice than over the protests of thousands of people , who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must also be recognised , if one is strictly opposed to any kind of damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is distorted by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the villages of Cuba , forgotten by the indu@@ str@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba included the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mills - regardless of the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvesting locally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was two years ago , when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after succ@@ eeding , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the frame of steel and concrete remained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting every day to the factories , which are still grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , does not ro@@ b the crisis in the sugar cane industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time have been in operation because they were received . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene re@@ members that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few decades ago , the message would have been a motive for concern for the country , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crus@@ hing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and they were barely competitive for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they left only the factories , which could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motifs , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and sugar crisis on the world market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agricultural Policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issued by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Nutri@@ tional Organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not everything went fine
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , over 65 million people , received their full wages for further education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same thing happened in the Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am sugar cane factory on May 14 , 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he most repe@@ ats is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost all respon@@ dents said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first year of the year , the first letters began to come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was official recorded documents , which would only be distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address and date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ise Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation . &quot; he assures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most developed industrial area of Cuba , and most important work@@ tops , has been wi@@ ped out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , no alternatives for jobs and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities were created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut talk of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years , the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to mig@@ rate , they also stopped throwing the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the perspective of the future , many young people left the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the care of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forty @-@ nine months bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand pes@@ o a month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , but he does not forgive the lies that one told him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have been beating him for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene goes to retirement for 65 years , not because he lacks strength , but because he is bit@@ tered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

first Nations Youth Use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshops guide mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten C@@ ree communities and worked together with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p Hop @-@ group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the young participants engage in discussions on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , dispute , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever they think . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which young people are the main actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia explains , for example , the history of Highway 16 , a road section in West kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the time , the cases were not cleared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on C@@ ree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel , as if no one would ever be interested in me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am trying to keep my days on earth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the day , where you will take our cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because we have lost our way in life as youth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can grow and move forward as well as our youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can do what they intended for the Creator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the commentary , readers and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able ( which is also published on his blog and published here with approval ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show potential customers what is right on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sculp@@ tural models of dishes &quot; ) from any food served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers see these plastic dishes , and decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the to@@ k part of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are usually that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend turns them into striking mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now in special sale : new mobile phones decorated with plastic tri@@ bun@@ als , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magnets : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are a few sho@@ dom@@ away fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) , we found a good use as a mobile stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this part , too , was made for the Tokyo train station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here is an apple , which holds your mobile phone : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is a great design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Com@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some mobile support and mobile teleph@@ ones allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura or laughing is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , some users had doubts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile phone with laughing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more bizarre plastic dishes can be viewed by : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and Get@@ ting regularly appear in statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reporting on drugs such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , Chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the sad@@ ness or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind each bone find , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized crime , not only lets us fear our lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how Fear Change , &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her husband and two her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have asked to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he was supposed to be back , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she is not paid off because they demand a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ Ã a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer by Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some years now , I have been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from the files of specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is angry or sad . it works , like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot be in@@ different , or look at this as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she continues to write :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who fear that they also happen to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see our weakness , when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ fu@@ tility of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; s@@ wat@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are trying to persu@@ ade that they will be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed for month money from their business until they broke up not only the business but also tore their family apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pain will never pass away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she included her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , as you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days that tears would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg and make some potatoes and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water and sugar and milk powder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he talks about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg , one for every year of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who was shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizenship of the Government of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 alone , the At@@ tor@@ ney General had 3@@ 103 Mor@@ ds . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories , which leave organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the country &apos;s soul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ é@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to demonstrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a picture worth a thousand unnecessary words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ckr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this post and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or , or un@@ mask a fake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how is the years after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to render trage@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ting and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinema close , which was full of people watching the football world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the houses were burned , and burned dead bodies were scattered in the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people were burned to the unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows rows of bon@@ ded bodies , which are lined up on the ground while people watch them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but here , history does not end its end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years the same photo has been copied several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 January 2015 , Fi@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses and shops were burned down , and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one left to count dead bodies , &quot; said a human rights resident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo re@@ appeared again , as it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely account the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a flash message published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were be@@ atings , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 alleged that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein had said , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original contribution , which was accessed last April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , also wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein His statement , but did not have the image of the DR Congo related . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the worldwide reach of false information
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces of these false tri@@ pled goes back to 2011 and 2012 , and are actually coming from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the Search Engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures which are very similar to the mentioned photo from the DR Congo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come from a mix of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have re@@ directed false reports , isolated others have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of impro@@ per use and associated them with the respective countries , on which side they were published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the countries listed below ( some cases are also linked together ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are some cases , which can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; country examples of false coupl@@ ings from the DR Congo , Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available for the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gra@@ y countries are examples , according to the metadata and information available about Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery examples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one side , which suggests rum@@ ors , asked that the said photo shows Christians who were killed by Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City does not only mention the false registration but also discusses the mis@@ use of the DRC in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies that were involved in the DR Congo and beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this article on explo@@ sions in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica c@@ ites as his source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although not known , whether the original report has included the picture ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this article draws attention to the continuing emergency of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar but rec@@ ites the work of an Indian Express article with the image of the DR Congo ; the article by the Indian Express did not include at the time of publication of our article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and blo@@ ggers made good content as you did , the web will be much more useful than ever before . &#124; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the following is known as the minister of the Republic of Yugoslavia ! &quot; ( warning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ cking photo you &apos;ve ever seen ! ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this page used the image as a proof , that Muslims were killing Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this claim has been re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact check , 2013 and once again in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was divided as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of frau@@ dul@@ ent use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blog , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Myanmar until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a right to what it was intended as &quot; pur@@ pos@@ ely final news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with respect to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judgment which is published exclusively in English contains references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run and be used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by bur@@ s@@ mic nation@@ alists ) .
Russia - 2012 . &quot; arter@@ ios@@ clerosis &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this news page fal@@ sely alleged that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted , in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the picture from S@@ ange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this publication the image is still included in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article from 2014 on Stu@@ dents who had been murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ olische Apostolic news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings but it claims it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , El Pa@@ is reported that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture of the DR Congo , marked with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities had a greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; United States , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and rescu@@ ed more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the aim was to focus attention on the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that was written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos , &quot; the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre was put into circulation , there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ ese mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( data entry with URLs and time / date stamp ) exist on the craw@@ ler and isolated , they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original tragedy of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two strong themes or frames , which go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued , compared to a European or French life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and insul@@ ts the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dissem@@ ination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example , for example ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zed and they have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study which investigated how violent media work to help others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used in the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , any investigation of wrong prescri@@ p@@ tions should also take into account how internationally they can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ char@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. un@@ removable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these unmistak@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ rei@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but all resist , stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ at@@ u &apos;s VAT @-@ cla@@ p language , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be@@ g you about your parents in recognition of how you made every effort in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bir@@ ds , his own words from his blog about : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deal with other cultures , reveal other ways of thought and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst floo@@ d@@ disaster of the decade
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the island state of Sri Lanka is facing the worst floo@@ d@@ water and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have tro@@ dden across the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a statement of the disaster centre in Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missed because of the floods and mud winds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ j@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air force provided five planes for rescue operations , and another five are made ready for transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also proved ready to help , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood , humanitarian assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Taxi call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the app in order to be informed about the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me launched a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combined efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring security and help to residents in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this prevented the loss of other lives , with the population of Sri Lanka now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , I took the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute , we call even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next we are right for Trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied from an American flag , other gu@@ inea slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I have been working or people who have met me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built themselves in their conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are Muslim .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different kinds . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are mus@@ li@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the need to be de@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what are the images , when you think of him ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love for you ?
peace ? what about peace ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Western sense , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as did the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this del@@ eting accounts for a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enti@@ cing language is determined by the dark man , whom one should fear , and the exotic woman that should be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid divided the story behind these images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these pictures stand out even today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood keep it steady . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ ous narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality of nine Muslim women in the past three decades , while the United States did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mighty group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , who lead movements for change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is seen that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which were brought up by slave ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and fla@@ wed , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the goal of anti @-@ sentim@@ ental attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or on alternative facts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also create narr@@ atives , which help us to understand the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry is fab@@ ul@@ ously failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest number of &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a third of the total Muslim population , African @-@ Russians are Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants , who come from 77 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then when Khan had re@@ invented the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were ir@@ responsible Muslims and Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now ir@@ responsible , Muslim and American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I joke , we don &apos;t wear all the hand@@ bags with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widely spread lies about Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing belt from a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ eit information that is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell , and because of the way we tell them there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger that tears the head of a woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or as the fri@@ ghtening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I &apos;d like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born when I was four years old when I was four years old in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my neighbour , my rock in the surf , that I am Muslim if it could look through the 15 meters concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the all@@ ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter when I hold her in my arms , and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the protection which are called the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging is the image of my grandmother on my mother &apos;s side with her sisters , how to win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim means to speak the prayers they told me , when I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim is how they taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a people , which was colon@@ ized by a &quot; empire &quot; for centuries , which a company was founded by the name Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dies @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in India , who was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at game risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim is to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have col@@ oni@@ alized all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped by a century ago , above a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion are deeply rooted in our unforgettable family trees , our un@@ incorporated history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent from the Antar@@ ctic , to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the rub@@ ble of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy reaches the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth that I feel , when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black lives count . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be an American , a p@@ act , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim , and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but fail to communicate them to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced two @-@ ness &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a mother means to take care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim regi@@ stran@@ ts , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries , which bom@@ bard it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ F@@ ly list , &quot; which largely performs Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we carry and the bombs that we throw at Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically sound picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to expose the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms of expression that we have in our news editorial offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ all Muslim ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; one initiative to encourage Muslim authors ; the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time , where we are in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , by creating the &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was so old now , as my daughter is now , but who made me a must @-@ have Muslim today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things , which I left here like a baking track in my speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that may awaken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ stell@@ ations took place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than one hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are , however , no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or read them in our newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why am I telling it here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public opinion were enth@@ r@@ alled four decades ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; in which we imagine a new future in which we have no president , while already broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; story@@ telling , by fli@@ ckr user Daniel@@ e Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier with someone ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices recently reported a different initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has organised events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the makers of the project , the following applies : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that take diversity - secure rooms , where inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; listening , often associated with this , &quot; these events will instead &quot; listen to listening to feel , to feel , to touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers first introduce and translate their story in their own language and then explain them in English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and depic@@ tion lead to the fact that the audience insi@@ sts on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language Daf@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience who doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities so far . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico ur@@ ges the United States re @-@ establishing sovereign debt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the last 3 April 2017 several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration ; the march started in the capital city of San Ju@@ ans on April 3 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly in Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ establishment of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos require that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial review and an executive committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt , which is not theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le with declining pen@@ sion@@ ers .
we demand immediate action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States , is suffering from a severe financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis , Puerto Ri@@ cos , requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside , measures are being taken without the participation and conviction of citizens to be dismissed from the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , hosted an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay : a researcher of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling who produces books within three to five days read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ qu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : collective In@@ qu@@ iry ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the book , published last year and available here , contains a number of papers dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge , and what the real costs are linked to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for Free Knowledge have worked alongside the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who were imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name was removed from the index of the A@@ dra prison , where he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , what have we given up from times of extreme beliefs ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in prison for Syrian government authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented himself as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his place of residence and condition remain unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and mom@@ entary manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more man@@ a@@ geable than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the hub of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he started with this work , the IS would do everything that em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this expedition into the digital arch@@ e@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spent all my life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am overwhel@@ med , if I call his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each one that has asked . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a commission that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens at every visit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I lose the reflection at the moment in which we embrace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I forget the prison of the prison
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I go into every detail of your voice and words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which I carry with passion with me
if your eyes say goodbye
and I &apos;ll leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly turned back to my lon@@ el@@ iness .
to rec@@ la@@ im all the moments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and over your absence , to we@@ ep and smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I testify to myself that I will return soon ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year flies away my soul
during the stay
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in your cage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are still in the cage of monsters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared in the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who were arrested or disappeared under violent use by the regime were tortured , or even executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambique : on account of corruption , director following the release of the prison sentence again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted to a corruption case , in which a member of the government returned to the state apparatus after half of his sentence to the workplace in which corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 with four other def@@ endants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose Council was ruled by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ setting into the company , which took place on April 19th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume its old post as the company did not undertake a disciplinary procedure after his detention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many inhabitants do not promise the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) condemned the decision of the company to resume the Director : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that the company should have in@@ stituted a disciplinary action against the tra@@ des@@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , however , seemed to be silent and did not cause appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media , re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; contrary &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has con@@ s@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to inflic@@ t harm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is fond of paying for his silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dispro@@ portion@@ ate !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn &apos;t speak any moral : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , and I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ als to return to the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served the state itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only as the first independent president in memory but also as a sharp , ed@@ ging and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral presentations was , when he confirmed for@@ c@@ efully that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of anything , even the father@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for 10 years and was free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and today the company , with which he makes money uncertain , is under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - New m@@ art gallery ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ uns .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the familiar social network took their posts from the grid , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or are generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook is cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or doubt , have been cens@@ ored for their use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ s@@ mic words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because it contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook should be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ t@@ ook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post , and check it by checking the words next door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it is time to bow their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or an alternative way of writing the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; when I was alert to this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not conform to the Facebook Community standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions , or who simply try to show their views against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the post , the author expressed his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asked for advice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but this does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned them as words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely sol@@ dered posts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover , that would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship provided a lot of mo@@ ckery among users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken away from the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech , but still removed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out whether Facebook is the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have increased social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to heat violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to put the hate speech on his bur@@ s@@ mic sides under control , critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better on context than on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children &apos;s marriage is illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law which should forbi@@ d this practice so that the age @-@ able age is now 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before this change in marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities accepted the practice , and in May 2016 it was a great public out@@ cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , each person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married since 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which endeav@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there were doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in early 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle once again posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the Bill against Child Care was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and not one vote against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having decided previously in the Senate , the draft may now become a law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of the social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws of the children &apos;s marriage were finally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who dressed as Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is too much time and unnecessary talk that has veiled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Abel Jackson was my opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the marriage has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years , regardless of religious affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draft for the change of marriage was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 MPs , and 35 of them were present at the vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who were agreed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the chil@@ dr@@ ens are no longer permitted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ like reporting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to all the activists who have posted him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ uties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal steps , should the law be adopted , and it seems to trigger his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legal when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , the majority of social media users wished to approach the issue differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather speaking , instead of discussing the problem we would say that the state , our daughters in front of it , would be mis@@ used , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think , that this is not a problem ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children are legally or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page , but in the cache it remained intact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is # gent@@ ler van@@ ished
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor notified the local news service Y@@ ar@@ news that they were h@@ acked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compiled by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day by day , it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students as well as re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although many experienced Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Turkey has been publishing articles from Wikipedia as recently as published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the platform remains closed , there are now several M@@ irr@@ or@@ backs ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform st@@ alled all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite legal prohibition , the content is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to place snap@@ shots from Wikipedia onto the IP@@ FS platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can help users to at least see all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Foundation , which is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror as well as an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ ages when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Moz@@ illa at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy , a mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see then , is from Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , the server will forward the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed colors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motivated him to wear a camera himself , trying to score the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time he was a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is trying to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he described on Facebook , how this prime location in his work helps him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just felt at home when I suddenly called back in Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately , I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was in and I immediately started to kne@@ ad pictures ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain world recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding of the fact that wild animals are not as terri@@ fying as they look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he should know it , for he stood by tig@@ ers already face to face : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late in the evening , the light is too weak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the booklet appeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Girls &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , a revised version was re @-@ published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm to preserve this practice alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian State of O@@ mu@@ a and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with her name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives apart from the name is also common among men . however , they have far less subsidies to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the little village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , came to a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the fin@@ eness of the patri@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the Camp@@ a@@ ign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and stands for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s council , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reports about how this club created a safe place for these women , and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round , acted by women who did not call their hus@@ bands name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem , with which the women could easily identify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to speak out of the name of their hus@@ bands , it is a custom which she held guilty and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband , and wishes him a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who does not keep this , is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tradition is so deeply rooted , that we never thought about this discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does this mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips . &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women could never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so shy she kis@@ sed during the whole exercise , and another decided to release all the pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an ancient tradition , women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at their name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she put to the women : his wife could not stop saying his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when her mother in law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a husband of a participant was less understanding , and the situation took place in force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ne@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ ne@@ ber@@ red point if he would do it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he just laugh@@ ed , and I stopped wearing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not stopped completely with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we make a trip at every disc@@ us club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last months , they celebrated their birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have never spoken so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are attached to our hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since their marriage , some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ine @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and more , smu@@ g@@ gled Roh@@ ini their own couple Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is confident that they will succeed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini affir@@ ms that things are moving slowly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , we have only made small steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to their husband &apos;s name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some , including myself , do it yet , but only if they are alone and are not with other family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only one or two still pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Z@@ inno@@ ber@@ red on their forehead , at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this club gives each one of us confidence , that something will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correspon@@ dents of the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community come from del@@ im@@ ited groups in India , making videos about stories that are not reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; messages from those who experience it themselves , &quot; and offer a hyper@@ regional context to report on global human rights and development challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les , celebrated with a memorial day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on June 29 , this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted for the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to the people here , that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many well @-@ known Japanese sizes reached their zen@@ ith , when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the Retail Trade Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese Kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch still survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if these &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places connected with the band . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Beat@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are the 5 places you absolutely need to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , pilgri@@ ma@@ ges cannot be cur@@ ri@@ le enough : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London , and ran over Abbey Road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did the same last year , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan base to use market technology , such as this R@@ amen shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the day is gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we hope you are with it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the people that men of poor people could be in Moz@@ ambique &apos;s target of attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of poor people for organ trafficking , probably for un@@ believers , worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from Malawi &apos;s border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the victims was be@@ headed , and part of the organs were taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a poor man can bring gold or wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time that successive attacks on young men in Mos@@ ambique have been registered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the South African country , this led to a mission to investigate this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique ready @-@ headed men in Moz@@ ambique are the aim of ritual attacks warned the Moz@@ ambique police for the latest murdered men due to their body parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already pursuing the case : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deepest sympathy to his family , friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects like Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to internet and open knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community , and participated in our meetings Arab B@@ logger in 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i told him that she was contacted by people who were spending the same time as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until now ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and in the future , we honor the creation of Bass@@ el as a pioneer in the Open Web @-@ movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been deployed in the last five years for his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of those who were arrested by the regime , or were forci@@ bly disappeared , were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2011 and 2016 , less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have come to death in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made only recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o drew attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State Haz@@ ards ) after signing the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a spokes@@ man says he was not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , China will continue to receive appeals from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to permit a treatment abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised a number of foreign reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment if the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway in Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on June 30 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
USA : USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad said that the Americans wished him that he had the possibility of treatment abroad , so that he could help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy was challenged by an angry response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to medical care of their choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision at the Congress to impose Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesperson Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had big concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , talk and contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um talks further :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights commitments , including freedom of expression , and freedom of expression of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an Declaration on June 29 , France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will finally accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Taiwan in Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of land@@ marks in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the governing Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he had been severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is internationally recognized as an independent state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York the minister noticed that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore as a city should be considered .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s it , with most people make a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; turning the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that we finally don &apos;t have a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons presented by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , considering that he appeared inevitably f@@ oul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from author@@ itarian rulers who are pre@@ ten@@ ding democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he disgu@@ ised appropriate questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to make his opinion clear , since she did not understand this conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personally , I find it a bit difficult to swallow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , it is a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our remarkable K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clear this point , as long as he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he pointed out to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
read the address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said in Singapore , very embarrass@@ ing ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes it , and is aware of what he is defending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , but do not defend their city but their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who must pay back our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink HR ID ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are we the citizens of a country , or the inhabitants of a city ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade adds to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many of the people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; defending the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question addressed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , I am sorry . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag quite visible on their back@@ pack , when they travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans contrast ... .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it was already when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canadi@@ ans have always wore small map@@ le blades in their luggage , to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a free healthcare !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , there are no weapons ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody seems to think , Canada is so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , we say very often &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most tolerant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have many American friends I admire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wouldn &apos;t make me anything , if you would be confused with Johnny from Dallas , for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , being called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ie@@ chy - like the we@@ ary , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being harmless is to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting , and to earn no attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major capitalist of Canadi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lack the warm , open kindness that I connect with my American friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a Pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pop @-@ band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that took the j@@ un@@ ta which took power in 2014 and despite its promises to restore the civilian government , continue to rule the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) , the band Tat@@ too Colour , describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend does . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although not specifically political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even Charlie Chap@@ lin &apos;s video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a look at these photographs of the video , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued in the past three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution which grants the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; amendment &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the j@@ un@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor the online content and to prosec@@ ute those who were accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets out a strict law against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( maj@@ esty insul@@ t ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two days later , it came to a coup of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are imprisoned in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened by long prison terms , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Te@@ aser clo@@ cked members of the band that im@@ itated the tribute of &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly authorization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ean are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , depreciation , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet sites in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , the total population of the District has been 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sche@@ v , are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a conversation , and it is difficult for him to end this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why do you speak ?
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , there is only paved road with al@@ lied magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ v , which are still one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where they are dried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend , and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave before Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a tells her , that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls T@@ ant G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will add zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children , lived in her house for some time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day , they are reminded of the village life before the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but this will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each child , Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child allowance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is working in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , t@@ aps and chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but over time , she lost her anxiety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as our conversation tends towards the end , a little boy runs past us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he plays with the ball , which rolls down the hill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a group of children is now pursuing the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while running , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for in@@ adequ@@ acy in their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink diamond frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans , who are on transit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for around 2,@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no sign to the hotel , but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ chin ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebasti@@ en travels with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells the Hai@@ ti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together , and that Afri@@ cans already speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months , selling SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ask him if he will get in touch with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the other end of the city , a blind alley leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken refuge in their small house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a polic@@ eman , and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I crossed the border across the desert , and we suffered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras , he fled with his wife and his three children , who wanted to make money from him without having a plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ si@@ ghted , offered him its roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months later , the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corri@@ dors , the trav@@ eller quietly consult their teleph@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a proud grand@@ ma , she spreads her album with numerous photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ id she made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travel@@ er more , boy and old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she sm@@ iles sad while she puts her close to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Check Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 July the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , the app is said to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message of the police , the app could identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remote control their home network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with filtering for min@@ ors , this app is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an app with these functions can , of course , be used in many ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable government actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the media outlet , which is based on Twitter , released the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police inspec@@ tors checked whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they forced the people to use appliances , which are intended for older people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a form of bondage through the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can record the password requirement of a Windows operating system , and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are turned into electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minim@@ ise the dissem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office while operating their computers and communication devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities released a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far from our blue , virtual world you are looking at and realise that you are all alone in one place where everything is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth , which is clearly visible both from the inside and from the outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one , who gives honour to their name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that has suppressed a list of feelings and expressions , which do not allow metaph@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even though the Earth is trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demonstrated his power over us , by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a peaceful protest , five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods cov@@ eted , except my own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that was stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ med after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I heard my voice resist@@ ed , through the silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , true friends joined me , and we al@@ lied to a magnificent picture that fulfilled my expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment you realize that you release the mind out of the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow down - nothing can give you back your voice , after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , and my father was already there , as I am now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ting eyes turned to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really sad to see me in your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps at the revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing as I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word of what I have said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sten@@ ch of this cursed set lies in my nose , to this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture I had been exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I passed through the courtyard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first office , I leave everything I wear with myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conc@@ eive all details , before I enter the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , they probably shared a bigger cell for me this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I can immediately set up myself without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : to strike with the fist against the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ comra@@ de was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first breath &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive traits can be seen on me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have loved a scar@@ ec@@ row to remove all those crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured in the garden of my head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I still hear them &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cries are heard every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that imagined the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under &quot; ; all@@ usion to the 13th se@@ urs of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security from us and prevent the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they were speaking out their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took care of the audi@@ torium and meet on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he appears to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that ent@@ le him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can do so much more important with your life than to protest you this day and to protest against demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m used to it , not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary communication medium , after a friendly conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and how it happened , it was irrelevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said I had to get used to it , even though I had nothing to do to make this penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in punishment in all their diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body , as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he calls the lovingly &quot; confession . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it starts with a plastic tube , probably from the clo@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give him the pleasure , and you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cries were not enough for him , which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables , to present us the amazing invention of a huge cable from their point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within one hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in it , why he was next to an electrically charged staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electricity flow@@ ed all my body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared , and the pain was back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two aw@@ ful hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must have been around midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an educated youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be wor@@ rying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and move you , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , they always had me free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where do they guide me ? !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he sli@@ ps into his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers , or his lips spotted with ni@@ cot@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel saw his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ tried opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not limited in his thinking , and can sympath@@ ise with people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ like against US foreign policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones should have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation - even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water he sha@@ kes N@@ es@@ café in two cups . during that time , it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has some weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protests against Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , the slu@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the sw@@ ath of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if one th@@ rows a glimpse into neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ adan &apos;s water - to not land in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the dep@@ uties and former spokes@@ persons of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert &quot; just &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which demand the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; which continue to be campaig@@ ning for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement may not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect a more clearly apparent reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b rejected traditional gender norms by rej@@ ecting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently recorded unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually trust them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past years , in Jordan , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honorary mor@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased - the in@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan does not yet have an adequate institutional infrastructure to support women victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a violation of law in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence cannot be held in prison for in@@ definite time , and for their release there is often a long period of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not do anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from subjects , which in his country long as t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit approach to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics was established to me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of songs , which are political at the core , can be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this song , a verse often repe@@ ats itself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want , be it belief or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he notices that barely anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on gender equality have been cens@@ ored until 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to later realize that his comments were torn from context , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube , it was uploaded without any cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ova , a poet of the eighth century who still remained in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ ovo , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why cannot Jordan do this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem , such as H@@ da@@ i@@ b , did nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service seized several former government officials and members of the teaching alliance with the reasoning that they had critically analysed the problems associated with the corruption rooted in the land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has turned out M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , also dre@@ aming of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the region is approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Cris@@ is Reporting , which A@@ man belongs to as a student Fel@@ low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neb@@ san in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is presum@@ ed that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the festive carri@@ ages and drums and dancing over more than one thousand years were mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous population of the region to force the indigenous population of the region .
we are at the Neb@@ san Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could grab a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ t@@ l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , I am looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two fixed cars are just to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high festival car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vian trade weapons against scissors and raz@@ ors

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside appearance and body care were so important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like those of the bar@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drugs trade are everyday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 2017 , a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles coming to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are experts from each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os public Facebook profile ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy school found in El Cal@@ la@@ o found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools instead of poor advice to find a training in hair@@ dresser art which allows them to find work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t it much more important , people who feel expelled , accommo@@ dating affection ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) . young people encouraged letters to write letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty meant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , who had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying out their arms around the clock , must now be able to integrate themselves as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take up its ranks and support them in building up a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans were joining together , and would have to help in the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla , who will then be handed over personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most pressing order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the City Government of Cal@@ i and Leonardo in Bo@@ got@@ a traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they had done earlier , in order to accept the orders of their leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between . &quot; the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a told later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after passing the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla that wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to enter , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hu@@ gged him completely , and sat down beside the gar@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he was also sorry for the war , but was sorry for the years to be the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , I just learned how to handle weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders gathered to a discussion round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students were all grown up , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hear these people who had never heard heard and had no electoral rights , and to realize that people that I have often seen as monsters and even hated , were very painful for me with their living circumstances and their environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who have been killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colum@@ n@@ ist has been informed that after dis@@ armament , peace would rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take arms and protest against their rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be facing many difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa , and its first publication on the website of OC Media took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of hazards , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the threat , which hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there , is not only created overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ y , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published that addressed the spread , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ y and grew up there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in fact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a group of ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , she moved out of fear for her life in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day , I was told that someone needed my help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the photos from my documents went through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you still honour the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just know that it was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I lost consciousness , and woke up in the hospital in the final analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , some women had got everything along and started to scre@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : in which wings were you laid , in which men or women ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it , but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for that , I am very grateful to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am grateful to him , that he has been respect@@ ful with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last February , I got threats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said absurd demands : some said to me , I need to prove it by running in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny , saying that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad , and Phot@@ oshop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have body size C - what should I have to say on television ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some older people said , once my mother spoke on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother was too much , and she laid a rope around her neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my human rights friends checked the license plates , it turned out that I was persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how are you bra@@ ided ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to disclose their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their help I left the country , but then something unexpected happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can still not understand how it could be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought her without registering me , without ID , without anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke my old SIM card , and threw it into the garbage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arrived and checked at the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe me , just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our people know already , in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you , it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we don &apos;t talk about sex equ@@ ation , that is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements , I still carry within me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we chat with camera , I actually don &apos;t bother to look like the person she reminds of her past - so to my male form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ man@@ t ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to someone who has sun@@ k in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told us that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was barely able to wait , and he did not lock out a new wave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , they will focus on family and relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , I mean , they probably charge the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has been experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are men still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons , too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there wouldn &apos;t be too many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then above all , those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives to put themselves to Cad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked some village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately di@@ pped to radic@@ alise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : is this just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their beard was grown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , there has been nothing new from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they just took them along .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports yet . but we assume that such actions are quite possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you know , whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair forever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think already before 2003 , I was already known all over Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to approach us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how is it possible , under the Sh@@ aria law ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ bular jeans and short tops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never bent my hair , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole town knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is often said to children , when they make fun of the sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how long did this grace period last ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality in television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily on the behaviour of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic has deterior@@ ated steadily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : what activity are you going to do now , too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month , not much in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I communicated with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we organize Te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no p@@ enny for that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I discovered these people myself , when I cl@@ asp@@ ed influ@@ enza . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no spo@@ ols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have what the Cab@@ ard@@ ins have , the Russians also have , and on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s uncomfortable for me to hear something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan , live together with men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; know , many think about transitions in men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not , whether I have a partner or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am not sad at all , I just know that I am myself now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local groups warn against an increase in suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 rejected the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he lit himself , firmly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ar@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to nour@@ ish their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region where a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi Mon@@ archy took power and made great efforts in 1925 to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran and some of the rich@@ est and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population receives little of this wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arabic areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi , now rose to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Director General for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who had a job , ended the primary school and completed 45 % of a university degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; systematic strategy , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans , and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not preference Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance among young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homes Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to disgu@@ ise their affili@@ ation with Ah@@ wa@@ zi , because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi had to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains to wait , whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women - call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminine in general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and triple underneath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet : when I talk to skin color , on racism , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the Dias@@ por@@ a , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift their voices and sing &apos; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &apos; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of racial @-@ motiv@@ ating violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background , to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of any kind of skin the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a black woman in whose centre the white woman stands , which refers to the sex as well as on the skin color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alised being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join groups , which are also absorbed by cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and differentiate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book African wom@@ anism : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can be worshipped in this way and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to my dark skin and due to my existence , I am recognized as a part of this paradigm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither ski@@ pped nor ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled to Iraq in the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to its community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little acclaimed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ay@@ an women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The We@@ eping Woman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their sorrow through the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ saal . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent against her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ ne@@ ena for abuse , the A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez adverti@@ sed nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her advertisement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women refund an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this explains why only 20 % of women who admit are victims of violence must be reported at all by the law enforcement authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; content 1 pun@@ ches and statistics 2 Un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that does not refrain from Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the figures available are alar@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence entered the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in peace courts . 86 % of women came here too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ads , 40 % of women were told that they were physically ill @-@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minist@@ erial Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , there are two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the death of women in Paraguay is not an independent crime , law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , where women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to her estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sign with the wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without ac@@ compli@@ ces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo by Jes@@ sie Ins@@ hr@@ an Pé@@ rez . use with friendly authorization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that nothing under@@ takes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer coinci@@ ded with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought , that I would once become a victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it just happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they dec@@ eive themselves by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever le@@ vi@@ ed the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they liked this so long by Carlos , and didn &apos;t leave him earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse , at least , had a certain complic@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was ill @-@ treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network of Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Victori@@ as , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her , that she was worth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victori@@ as advertising with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she introduced a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , mainly about money , power and influence of her former partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ natives ) are part of a campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d is to be declared an independent crime , and is harder to punish than it is in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Leg@@ isl@@ ative text was modified in some respects to support MPs in the law that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft law fores@@ aw the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence currently have to carry out , if they just want to report and provide safe accommodation to the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence can no longer be seen as a normal thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who is silent in the face of these facts , makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders will be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to report such a long ad until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously parts of the law were altered , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opinions about the changes are taking apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper , continuing attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been closed on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a year ago , the Indonesian Auth@@ orities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison , where he is sentenced to one year imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court , but later released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , following his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , he has been dressed in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the chief ministers of the country , Minister of Defence , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sul@@ t@@ ans &apos; reign is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic civil liber@@ ties , including press freedom , restric@@ ting media freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities are systematically limiting peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman has been reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the committee , was charged from the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i &apos;s arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissem@@ ination of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms , and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of the ban of publication and the slan@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was convic@@ ted to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit of 5,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months &quot; imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the release of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Court of Appe@@ al rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper faces attacks by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement that extended the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closure of az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases , in which Oman has been viol@@ ated by the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further injuries include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ inum and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Cuban authorities : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 . allow You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j to release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judi@@ ci@@ ary ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization supporting human rights defen@@ ders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is done with his consent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not mentioned at all . it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on @-@ site : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second , research undertaken by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as post@@ do@@ c at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus even before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier is a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM : in your opinion , what are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver , instead of being a maker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM : where does funding and support come from ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I saw great students from all ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is demand for special scientific education , starting at any age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : often it is the limited rate of doing things , and the created access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make available for payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; Se@@ eds Produc@@ ers Change Global Food Production
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports solutions to environmental problems worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ eba , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of salad he can get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cere@@ al or cart@@ on types . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia of old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds salad , but now it takes longer since his work becomes increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a river would be a b@@ oul@@ der in which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is very careful not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement , which is getting bigger in the United States and throughout the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse at the station , where plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds like that , as if the movement originated from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves that others can freely use the seeds grown by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to sell business and sell them . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders simply allow others to breed their own varieties , and not to cut it out immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the em@@ eri@@ fied Professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the seed , seeds play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , we should also know that the way this vegetables is cultivated is threatened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to keep their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ss@@ i @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available genetic pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material which is therefore always restricted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , employed a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a question of view
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have pur@@ pos@@ efully desired traits , from those through which their flavor or color improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand such threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . currently , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are far worse by climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s spokes@@ woman , C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is important and decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property is other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , these instructions help others to get the same result with another method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not prevent innovations , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton sees it differently : 20 years to wait for a patent , certainly no innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have to wait so long to grow plants adapted to the changed environment , the struggle would have been lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources should always have been a common good and should remain unchanged : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to make farmers their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , morph@@ ology does not interfere with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plants form them themselves and as breeders , we have no idea how the plants do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ p , plant breeding in O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also bred their own values into it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures believes that her@@ bi@@ cides are used for their cultivation , cultiv@@ ating in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my concept is exactly gent@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they abol@@ ish the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his breeding garden , the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton are looking for salads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ ton also believes that bre@@ eder would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new products more strongly than companies that patent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know my competitors are selling my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected from competition for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide resonance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to Open Source , and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agreement co@@ operates with an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( provisions for breeding vary from country to country , hence the O@@ ss@@ i commitment cannot simply be taken from one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the European Commission &apos;s executive , the European Commission , states that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to apply the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organisation is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official launch of the launch is scheduled for next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to change and improve seed policy in order to ensure stable food supply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems is also emphasized by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hoping that more people will soon recognize him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and organic food mainly focused on where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Wiki@@ pedi@@ ans from around the world took part in the Wik@@ i Lo@@ ves Earth photo competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best photos of natural monuments ( such as nature reserves , protected areas , national parks and picturesque landscape ) can be admired in a common gallery on Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Com@@ mons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizers and other contribut@@ ors have used the h@@ ash@@ tag # Wiki@@ Le@@ es@@ Earth to publish photos , and drive forward the willingness of sharing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , they shared more than 13@@ 7@@ ,000 photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest achievements of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed and promised for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true , despite this attack and the ridi@@ cul@@ ation of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who defend the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , for example the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of site barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer has access to Egypt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissem@@ ination of columns and articles that he did not write for websites and media in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog , which he set up to handle the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was even the goal of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ gger , the provider with whom also the blog is native to , is still available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security staff , while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics , and the human rights situation in Egypt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fac@@ ebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the locking by the government and reflected what this meant for him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blogs to lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of being besi@@ eg@@ ed by the National Security Council , blocking blogs , as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ) They proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I used it to post articles to avoid cens@@ orship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , after having locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the courageous will walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) blocked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . these were technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) such as orange and Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AF@@ TE also documented the closure of providers , through the transformation of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis using which it can proceed against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship , and who will attack it next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the people argue .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day by day , newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least , find the managers of a local newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the Editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced to set up a new column called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the papers , for their decision , explained the newspaper as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . , this is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative , that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes announced that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world , with a war break in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same video , a journalist writes that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the editorial article , the newspaper writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to conce@@ al atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not civilians , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and their partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it is used ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article on the Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil news portal , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argue that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning , as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of the public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the State of Rio in 2003 , was to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela and a unit permanently station@@ ed there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , this resulted in a decrease of violent death cases . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports on ch@@ ic@@ anes and repres@@ sions against the poor communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not correspond to - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where a chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the Assad regime has been committed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these territory controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which led to local residents to depend on locally produced or through tunnels and check@@ points smu@@ g@@ gled foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and acade@@ mics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional , planted food in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it will become more and more known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da to use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to don@@ ate to Can@@ Do until Monday , 4th September 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of mushroom seeds , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons : &quot; breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the extraction of new food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred people were prot@@ esting in many districts in Portugal on October 21 , demanding justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forty @-@ two persons died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region , where there were 4 deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande occurred a similar tragedy where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured were killed by the fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery in 2017 alone , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there is no fire in 4 districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; numerous videos spread on the web , showing pictures that allow better insights into what happened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the predictable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the target of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people wondered why civilian protection was not able to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as far as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated to everything and nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of open streets , surrounded by fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy could have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , construction permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed construction activity if the applicant had access to self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val will continue in the same article by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread after fires of this species . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these problems , the website of the civil defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information , using the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers failed to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ .000 users who followed the fires .
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the autumn of 1994 , the seizure of Afghanistan by the Taliban started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the Eth@@ nic Group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even never . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the boy was to break up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his uncle would pick him up , and bring him to the locks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt defen@@ cel@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred , came closer and closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than himself , to earn his living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no service there and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon at the open windows , so we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the dangerous voyage to the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to needy people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high percentage ratings , but it is also true that the conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres , &quot; which are impro@@ vised bodies in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can withdraw for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af has helped to free himself from these conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af plug@@ ged its entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a fast bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans run businesses , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ du@@ a the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also stand in Afghanistan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and target back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never forget my country , and I cannot live happily , if I know my people are suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I plan a project for peasants from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society , and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af creates plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest powers on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys &apos;s Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in worldwide internet rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill , which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would need to be able to use the social networks within six months of submitting legal notice on the authority &apos;s website , indicating their full name and ID number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever negl@@ ects this step , could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the extra@@ dition of a pen@@ al payment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which has been adverti@@ sed by sixty members of the parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another deleg@@ ate proposed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or a high civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and the state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 , while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup led to the inauguration of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 prot@@ esters who were arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a court date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison management failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light of others weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interro@@ gation of Tunisi@@ an activists to scre@@ ened documents
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was hear@@ ti@@ ly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic according to the plan expressly provided a controversial law to the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption acc@@ using official am@@ nesty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the document published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website on 21 April , sheds light on how the presidential plans look like to support the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the designation of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code which journalists assured the right to protect their sources .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he acted as a witness in the Tunis District Court on 0@@ 9th May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to new regulations of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Reg@@ ulations , it is also stated that registration with full real name will be required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analy@@ st suggests that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is unclear , however , how the authorities apply these regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only selective in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then can we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ so nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the Land Government as an &quot; organizer of the dissem@@ ination of information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this designation is part of a law dated 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these websites are currently web sites such as V@@ Cont@@ acts and Od@@ no@@ isse@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkish court features Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it became a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to recru@@ it a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is thus , alongside China , one of the few countries around the world in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
great Britain can not stop to s@@ wir@@ l
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this week , the British government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian population outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
