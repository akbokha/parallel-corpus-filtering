<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"" "" "" "isn't it much more important, people who feel expelled, accommodating affection?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt and Cristian Palacios Foundation from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Carta por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation). young people encouraged letters to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "" "" "internationally, the signing of the peace treaty meant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, who had been exposed to war rhetoric and carrying out their arms around the clock, must now be able to integrate themselves as civilians." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take up its ranks and support them in building up a new life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians were joining together, and would have to help in the integration process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"" "" "" "the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla, who will then be handed over personally." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more needed." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2198">"" "" "" "" the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace, "they say." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2650">"" "" "" "for the emerified Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2651">"" "" "" "according to the seed, seeds play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance."

<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"" "" "" "all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." in order to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, we should also know that the way this vegetables is cultivated is threatened.

<seg id="2657">"" "" "" "Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available genetic pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material which is therefore always restricted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2658">"" "" "" "Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, employed a genetic variation in carrots and their availability." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "" "" "plants are bred in such a way that they have purposefully desired traits, from those through which their flavor or color improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand such threats such as pests or diseases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">"" "" "" "opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. currently, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are far worse by climate change." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2663">"" "" "" "in an e-mail, Monsanto's spokeswoman, Carly Scaduto, acknowledges that genetic diversity is important and decisive for Monsanto's activities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "" "" "it contradicts the view that intellectual property is other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"" "" "" "often, these instructions help others to get the same result with another method." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "such protection does not prevent innovations, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">"" "" "" "Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait for a patent, certainly no innovations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2668">"" "" "" "and if you have to wait so long to grow plants adapted to the changed environment, the struggle would have been lost." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources should always have been a common good and should remain unchanged:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
