<seg id="2632">"" "" "" "but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2633">"" "" "" "the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or crimped leaves." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2635">"" "" "" "as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but now it takes longer since his work becomes increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if a river would be a boulder in which I have to paddle." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"" "" "" "it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders." "" "" ""</seg>

"" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"" "" "" "for the emerified Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2651">"" "" "" "according to the seed, seeds play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"" "" "" "all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." in order to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, we should also know that the way this vegetables is cultivated is threatened.

<seg id="2657">"" "" "" "Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available genetic pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material which is therefore always restricted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2658">"" "" "" "Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, employed a genetic variation in carrots and their availability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2659">"" "" "" "for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby assume that mass-grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "" "" "plants are bred in such a way that they have purposefully desired traits, from those through which their flavor or color improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand such threats such as pests or diseases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">"" "" "" "opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. currently, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are far worse by climate change." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2663">"" "" "" "in an e-mail, Monsanto's spokeswoman, Carly Scaduto, acknowledges that genetic diversity is important and decisive for Monsanto's activities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "" "" "it contradicts the view that intellectual property is other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"" "" "" "often, these instructions help others to get the same result with another method." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "such protection does not prevent innovations, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">"" "" "" "Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait for a patent, certainly no innovations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2668">"" "" "" "and if you have to wait so long to grow plants adapted to the changed environment, the struggle would have been lost." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources should always have been a common good and should remain unchanged:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
