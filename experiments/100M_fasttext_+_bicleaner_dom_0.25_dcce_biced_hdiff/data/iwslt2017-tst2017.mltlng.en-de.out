that is James Ris@@ en .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave literally blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an unbelievable story .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but do you know , who didn &apos;t like the chapter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified the Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s model to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the First constitutional amendment , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en was living in prison with the risk of being imprisoned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although she &apos;s indications that it would be essential for her case , the demands of the government in Ris@@ en were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of failing and taking risks , they could do their digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , have secretly acquired his telephone certificates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit and even travel information with the list of his flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amid this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all US governments in front of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government ranks too much of their work than secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and indeed they can do so from the moment in which they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in witness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have a possibility to get mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or a wall street insi@@ der , who warns us of the next financial crisis . or a wall @-@ street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to impose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Papers &apos; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to give an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works , as it works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who are worried about the next release , and on the next disclosed documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that sounds like the plot of an agent actor , or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems to be removed from you , me , ordinary people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that applies to all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and conce@@ al -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably because there have been no prominent Americans yet , those in these revelations came to this sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans , who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but through the principle after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had a leak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , in some U.S. states , less information is needed to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here with Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to figure out how all this is in practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked that all up to a lawyer our investig@@ ators made suggestions about how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has submitted proposals to our hidden investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may sound very wicked , as if nothing could do anything about it ; as if nothing could ever have changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite that some things have begun to change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years , we have seen bre@@ aches to more transparency , as concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 , Northern Ireland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU registers in central registers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties introduced a draft law in both parliam@@ ent@@ eries , but this does not make progress that we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency , which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the story , as I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back yard sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped , and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I invited him to a beer , he told me about how he wanted to change the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , husband ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ä@@ h , how to please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild est@@ ran@@ ger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid that I went out of bed , cl@@ ashed to the door and shut down my bedroom door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in touch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of art , which he bought from me , hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my first experience as a host , completely changed my perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood , actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s make a time jump , two years later ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , creativity can create it , to turn fear into fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such an air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ette tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started to start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had we just discovered that at the same time , we could find new friends and pay our rent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
things were rolling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to find out , if we could make a business concept from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people are posting public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the Internet , they can invite foreign people to stay with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , they are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one , who is still in comfort , would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we , as children , have learned that strangers are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a problem , you can count on the things you can do . we could design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design of immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to give you a sample , which degree of trust we are striving for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , I would like to lock your mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this quietly landing of panic , which you sense now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is , your home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visitors can read not only your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , most guests feel when they stay somewhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , our company can exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like that , who &apos;s actually Al G@@ ores cell phone now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could you please , on Twitter , that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can now return the mobile phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name , if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine you would have 150 convic@@ tions that all say : &quot; he can hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your cell phone ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a well thought out feedback system , trust is crucial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , we made some things wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was hard for people to give negative assessments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their assessments before we put them online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they relate to age and residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not surprisingly , we trust the people most who are most similar to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by assessments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a good reputation encourages simil@@ arities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one deals with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother . -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your home ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can I create it with design , to make this degree of openness ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with what we didn &apos;t reck@@ on , the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , you can see how many people take advantage of our offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can see three things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; third , a need that had not been covered before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , business runs very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there are also times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were guests , who were not allowed parties or apartments rav@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I stood in front of the front , when trust was broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts , if I only think about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million spent nights had one problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for men trusted in one another , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when trust works , wonderful things can arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers , who tend to be heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels , who save a life even though they don &apos;t really know one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they get past books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can stay longer , without calculating the extra nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions work together ?
it &apos;s about an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now just call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humans lay a part of themselves , and that changes everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would be , if travelling was a rich buffet from local impressions ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would be if at any place you visited a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly , and to show you one at a pub tour of which you have never heard before ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would be , if we would design apartments from scratch ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would that look like ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would be , if cities would adopt the idea of joint participation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were taught to people , whose children were educated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . today , 7@@ 85 000 people in 19@@ 1 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality has existed previously .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing .
almost overwhelming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to think about it every time , when a red Maz@@ da goes past me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or suppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the media represent people who look like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies show that Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to meet you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a car@@ se@@ ater fitness fan@@ atics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was sevent@@ een , I met the decision to ou@@ ting me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funny thing was : back then it was a feminist Declaration of In@@ dependence , and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I had to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not only accepted passi@@ vely the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I read it , thought , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was trust and dedication , which deep@@ ened itself with each reading of the Qur &apos;an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves you somehow ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I married and began as all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the Egyptian American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock turned into rebellion quickly .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspi@@ cious one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember how I ro@@ de -- when we ro@@ de -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it became Friday that week -- the day , where Muslims gather for prayer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people , which were held for Muslims , imprisoned and defeated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were really fire stops on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people who attacked this country , attacked our country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they speak of my church , like a tumor in the body of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it only raises the question , are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole , and a ben@@ ign tumor can only be observed under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is mis@@ placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the shut@@ down of mos@@ ques will make America safer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may share a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regular visit of a mosque means to consider people more tolerant , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and like me , a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are radic@@ alised in their basement , or in bed in front of a computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe the real Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people going to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would put ourselves into their imagination , when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology , in their &quot; holy book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at them , they don &apos;t do what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is their brut@@ ality , which they can read these things into the scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl came to him , because she preferred to join the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every spiritual man with whom she spoke , she sil@@ enced and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring it into trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Ima@@ m re@@ affir@@ med the connection to God and its church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what she learned in the mosque , she hoped to join the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies - show that if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one study shows : if people report messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims pushed upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it can be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the allocation of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was talented , talented , promising ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was st@@ un@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who posted outward appearances on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did we go to the mosque , or did we stay safe at home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear or one in which we can freely practise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , as half of the assembly were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this moment , I collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people were there because they had courage , compassion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to be number one ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will you join those who think : we are better than those . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia - you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with drau@@ ght are working in a class@@ y think tank , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am as usual , as it is allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , in no way , I am an exception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become a billion @-@ dollar business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before air package delivery into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by connecting together , air devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also build self @-@ locking structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and act in general on natural laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our goal is to exceed the limits of possible , in an autonomous flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plane , trying to beat two flies with a flap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like other starter motors , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike most newcom@@ ers , it can float , and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a limitation of tail star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter what location the optimum position is reg@@ ained , and the performance can be improved by practicing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter is known as machines with a thousand movable parts gathering together to hurt you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically simplest remote control unit . it was invented recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is mechanical , inside life very much happens so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starter . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood that it is right to throw it right , if all look at it is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in sweet@@ ness , this machine is the omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they see , that he is just symmet@@ rical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , it receives the au@@ ral ability , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rotating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some things can be displayed in models , the rest is learned directly while flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once flying machines are part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the others counter the clock@@ wise direction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also restricted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will demonstrate this now , by making half of them air@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expressions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread , and equip it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled , therefore there is no upper limit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hopefully , these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Broadway , the particularly safe machine would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for types like us , wages are in development and creative act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential , is the icing on the cake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were orbit@@ ing each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this short moment , they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very big pop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their energy , however , did not put them in the form of light -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire energy was released into space @-@ time space , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , let us arrange the events in time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.3 billion years ago , life has just emerged on Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stand up with us -- even the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 25 years ago , a group was particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , resulting in black holes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most thought they were crazy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased considerably , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes ro@@ amed through the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the par@@ ting from my father &apos;s father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , that was the fruit of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a mu@@ til@@ ation in the structure of space and time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , instructors in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really al@@ dic dance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow and stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and pun@@ ched at the meeting of the waves . the elong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the following : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is quite handy , because so you can customize a picture or map of things by experiencing the light coming from several points around you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in tones , this is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example the face of your child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead we listen to certain features like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with them , we cannot produce simple images of objects in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range for Lig@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to listen to the gravity , about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has long been busy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just circulating : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning the two bodies very quickly , one hears the same p@@ ie with an additional key change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- I heard this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which revol@@ ves around as fast as the sticks of your sha@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : let us consider briefly , what this means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we know of it , because we have heard it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this consists of the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing an entirely new way for the exploration of the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this path , we can listen to the All and hear the un@@ seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are very useful , and we learned a lot about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exciting physical processes happen , however , in the nucle@@ us that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never see through , because these op@@ ak are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own after@@ glow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and most importantly : I &apos;m optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of whom we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt , which we did not expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that show black holes such as Lig@@ o watched them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sau@@ cers for our archaeological work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the origin of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : now , the challenge is to be as bold as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and p@@ ie of the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year , I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , but yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , but yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my fear , to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a definite yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected form . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; babies &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked her if I could play with her when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from there on , I always swear to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sag@@ as for playing with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a writer , I think things out , awaken you to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m watching TV . I &apos;m producing TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I make TV , in great style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this TV season , I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program to the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each shipment offers hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , three episodes : &quot; how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America , my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all over the world , my series are in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced so far . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know who is still doing it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it to you , so that all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re a company , a country or a class@@ room , take me seriously , and it is true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not a dream job in a dream job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I am deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when I set up troops , I painted on a screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so as to wear a high tone , run a marathon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is creative , mechanical , demanding and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is such a change in me , when work is going well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people assume that when I explain to them the sums , I am talking about writing that writing is a pleasure for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what she does . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the sum -- when I started to work and work with television production , when I began to work and work , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sum ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum is action and activity , which is a drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum is music , the hum@@ ming is light and air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have such a h@@ um , you can &apos;t asp@@ ire to size differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feeling not able to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is called the sum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or maybe , it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know only that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I will , the more episodes , the more things are watching , the more I write history , the more expectations are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sum , the sum , the sum , the sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the sum stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burnt out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth , that their mother is a single work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby titles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine was silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I no longer loved my work , the engine was off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum did not come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours , no regret , no regre@@ ts , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was the sum , and the sum I was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , stupid author @-@ titanium &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing is to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I want to say no , as two things become aware of me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say Yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ätz@@ chen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she does not call anybody any more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hate it when I am Titan and sing my bu@@ zz@@ iness , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we play and play their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of sum@@ ming , I can do nothing except to watch out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pens and the song in which it is letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air in this place is so close , that I can hardly breathe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental door goes , and an energy shift is coming in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel it .
the sum is slowly coming back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the sum , but a sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and now I feel , as if I know a magical mystery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but let &apos;s stay with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum , the hum@@ ming , the titanium dome , this is only the replacement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I ask you who you are when I &apos;m telling you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how function@@ ally my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum is not a force , and it is not labour @-@ specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the pleasure .
the real h@@ um depends on love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum is the stream , which comes from the lust of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real h@@ um is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real h@@ um ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real h@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing is not easy for me , how to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts !
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this admission is painful , for what a person prefers to be than home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I &apos;m too relaxed , is none of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we shave in the garden , before and forth , back and forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make small dance parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you probably are right , but you can do it too ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ man or bis@@ cuit replaces me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and speak my teen@@ ie daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the Year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only 15 minutes , it does not need more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even at a bad mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day is short : dinner , the children will be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 15 minutes are in !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to play &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;m victorious . friends meet , reading books , enjoying the day -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 minutes on the piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum came back in my spare time , and the sum seems to return when I &apos;m not working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
working does not work without games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is my sum .
the sum of life .
the sum of love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is me that I am a Titan , I have never seen a Titan , playing the trip to Jerusalem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said yes to less work , and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet , I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more clear my head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I listen to the sum . the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the sums , the sum , the bu@@ zz , the other , the real hum@@ ming : the sum of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , dying , nude and new feeling of life in me is wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a writer , I think things out , I &apos;ll stir you to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , severe disability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , they have one of the best known , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro cure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I was Chief Physi@@ cian and worked day and night in the emergency room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , I cared for patients with skull @-@ brain trauma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must imagine that in skull @-@ brain Trau@@ mat@@ a , the brain is stimulated and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the inner pressure of the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to let cells grow from a tissue piece , is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments in order to thri@@ ve them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after many attempts , it made Jean @-@ François . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they split slowly , and after a few weeks they even died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ um @-@ beef cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the stage of the fet@@ us , they care for the folding of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , why do they stay ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing , however , is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are facing a potential cell source , enabling brain healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they then mark color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last step , we planted them at the removal table of the same individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we describe these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we rush up the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were taken back home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second scenario we added an injury to and rei@@ m@@ pling exactly the same cells , and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they achieved a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we moved the motor motor zone in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as it would happen to people , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed , and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before injury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not as precise , and not so fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plantation plantation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can tell you , these were also very exciting results for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since that time , we have found out much more about these cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , this study must be carried out with a small group of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the West , we make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable ant@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance ministers in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with me , I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group , could save us , but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future ble@@ ak , and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin @-@ summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all recognize the debt mountain .
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of unused cash that is too fearful to invest in wealthy savers and corporations , where it would be productive and income to produce the debt and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past 3 months , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar notes after a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , spending the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to blow out the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which do not balance themselves through the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that would be true that his son would kill him if he grows up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead to E@@ gre@@ pus k@@ ills him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my Ha@@ des with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his very wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society , in which the free and the arms control the government as a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held long -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a candle , which shines very bri@@ ghtly , it is quickly burned out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , and the economy gradually under@@ mined policies and dis@@ em@@ powers them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you wondering why politicians are no longer like that , like before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not in a degeneration of its DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government , and yet not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my coat with capitalism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about it , it is about like a flock of predat@@ ors that have nour@@ ished the animals that they nour@@ ish , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they star@@ ve at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics itself is har@@ med by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; retains the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago , and it didn &apos;t look very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only gain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as I think -- in countries like China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a disease called &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is not , therefore , whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has brought forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is being replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something that the society uses in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income comes from capital and revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no distinction between those who do not belong to those who work there , and employees who do not belong there . no more exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of global political economy : please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; in the interest of all humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of Kosmos . &quot; and any government pays the sum corresponding to the trading deficit or trading income of each country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in Br@@ itt@@ any W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have them , particularly against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world I describe to you is also liber@@ ally where it prefers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer depends on how we decide together politically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in your biography , you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore , I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not busy , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : this is a very Greek - a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s point of view .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some respects , if I can say this as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was particularly scep@@ tical , concerning the democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to present China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences , as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : I guess that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us say good @-@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent denial that a massive rejection of the euro went through the euro area and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , have voted for the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you try to keep an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be hes@@ itating for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : what changes are you looking ahead ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders , finding a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the mind bog@@ gling through the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not want to admit that they had been a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worse than the Great Depression , it is worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the Troika , who imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not surviving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if it does not survive , the released centrifu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : we hope , that you are wrong at this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for visiting TE@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Roy Price , most have never heard before , although he probably is responsible for 22 minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes back to the decision , which Roy met three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios .
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for making the shows and content that Amazon will produce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are so many TV series , that Roy cannot select any . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows have received this review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price is not about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle expression , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he stops competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch everyone free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if Amazon is free for free stuff , it is easy to access , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are watched by Roy and his team , who record everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you skip or look again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process them and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four repub@@ lican U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 - something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes things different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give the shows their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they had all the parts together , they went on a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because logic says , that it should work with everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data analysis does not work so it is a bit sc@@ ary , because we live in a time where we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company , and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software . come in contact , you are in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone is in prison here and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis is despite the many data , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always the best results produced , which is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way you can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked perfectly , year by year by year , until it suddenly stopped working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the data of experienced companies , such as Amazon and Google , sometimes mis@@ understand something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all these errors , data are visi@@ bly inf@@ used in the decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the case of legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we should rather make sure that data are helpful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful choices based on data and not successful decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly need two things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second you put together the individual parts together to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help break up a problem and understand its parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts , and then come to a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for that , there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to compose parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all those parts , put together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they competing for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is what the data says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many know it .
it is also called the Magic 8 ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I will f@@ use it with a technical demonstration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it still pays to make decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and take risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you nice .
