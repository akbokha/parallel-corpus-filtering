<seg id="3">"" "" "" "long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard phones of Americans." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "however, it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "if that sounds crazy, read it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "but do you know, who didn't like the chapter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years, the government has identified the Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in this train, he became a symbol of the government's model to condemn whistleblowers and to spy journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "according to the First constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "from 2007 to 2015, Risen was living in prison with the risk of being imprisoned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "but then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although she's indications that it would be essential for her case, the demands of the government in Risen were dropped." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "instead of failing and taking risks, they could do their digital footprints for him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "and so the investigators, without his understanding, have secretly acquired his telephone certificates," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit and even travel information with the list of his flights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "amid this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "unfortunately, this is only one of many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned him more than all US governments in front of him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government ranks too much of their work than secret." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower to a journalist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "but just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "and indeed they can do so from the moment in which they contact, rather than in hindsight, in witness." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "today, there is communication software that didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is today further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "so the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger all of us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts, such as Edward Snowden, have a possibility to get misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="48">"" "" "" "also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad's mailbox companies in tax havens has." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="52">"" "" "" "it seems to be removed from you, me, ordinary people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">And that applies to all of us.</seg>

<seg id="58">"" "" "" "I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "in the US, I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "presumably because there have been no prominent Americans yet, those in these revelations came to this scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans, who hide their fortunes in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="81">"" "" "" "and to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>

<seg id="810">"" "" "" "with some help, the brain can help itself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"" "" "" "at that time, I was Chief Physician and worked day and night in the emergency room." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"" "" "" "instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"" "" "" "to let cells grow from a tissue piece, is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"" "" "" "it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="829">"" "" "" "perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells, which can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="830">"" "" "" "the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">"" "" "" "they split slowly, and after a few weeks they even died." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="836">"" "" "" "so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellum-beef cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"" "" "" "at the stage of the fetus, they care for the folding of the brain." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="849">"" "" "" "we are facing a potential cell source, enabling brain healing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"" "" "" "we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"" "" "" "in the last step, we planted them at the removal table of the same individual." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we describe these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we rush up the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"" "" "" "thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="859">"" "" "" "in the second scenario we added an injury to and reimpling exactly the same cells, and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="863">"" "" "" "of course, we couldn't stop here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"" "" "" "when they achieved a stable dexterity level, we moved the motor motor zone in the motor cortex." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="869">"" "" "" "thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="870">"" "" "" "just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="871">"" "" "" "the patients are paralyzed, and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="872">"" "" "" "when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="873">"" "" "" "on the left, they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">"" "" "" "it is not as precise, and not so fast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="876">"" "" "" "now you see when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation plantation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows have received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"" "" "" "if your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>

<seg id="1097">"" "" "" "not always the best results produced, which is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"" "" "" "yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
