&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps , which change your view of the city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Irish institution , where young people should meet today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pit chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is dug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is annoying , when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone knows that , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the historical maps of the Bavarian state of Bavaria , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very enligh@@ tening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich @-@ based Merk@@ ur , since the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital Bavaria Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet , which one does not immediately recognize as such . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cities and municipalities , detailed maps , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inau@@ g@@ ural leaflets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were incorporated into the big map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying government , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first measurement in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the spring of 1800 , the French military leader occupied Bavaria with Austria during the Second Coalition War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical recording of Bavaria in order , of course for military purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern Card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison of Early / Today , the example of the state capital is most impressive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city has expanded in all directions , and has grown together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , thus in 18@@ 77 as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings were built around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where today the West Park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : there appears a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primitive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from which the base tax was derived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are small plots there today , no more farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October Festival since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present District of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the Sky , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Irish Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld road one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based circle @-@ Ir@@ rig@@ ation was born on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Au@@ er Lü@@ beck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard of Gu@@ dden initiated the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with King Ludwig II &apos;s death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the ank@@ le of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who engaged for an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 280 patients there was first room , later on 500 seats were extended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Hair in 1905 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum München @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people are now meeting in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and moved it into a youth hostel with educational establishments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural approach to the original construction of the Ir@@ rig@@ ation , which had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square , &quot; the shopping street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big one remained until today , at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ ating and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
citizens &apos; group publishes travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association to Pro@@ mote Far@@ mers has issued a warning for colored people , who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to pay special attention to travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to complain about discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour ; they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group quoted alle@@ gations against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ander died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the voyage and was arrested by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General At@@ tor@@ ney of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state are more likely to be hal@@ ted than white in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring money or let relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s report of hate crime , which state the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warnings are also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona since the States promised immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
soft aun@@ ching project is elementary
the fishing village Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and will continue next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag , Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the fisher@@ man &apos;s CD@@ U @-@ town association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties in the square court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , providing 40 milk cows and also many young animals and home to five apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is for him the alternative marketing pathway for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este , exclusively regional offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he called the &quot; elem@@ ental &quot; key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on such steep faces , I cannot profit profit@@ ably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the green area care for a lot of work , a lot of things must be processed with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; he emphasized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead to organic production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that &quot; the Commune was aware of the significance of the soft start project and is happy about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4,000 euros per hect@@ are farmers would have to be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue to operate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disclosure area is 40 hectares , which can not be explored until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the total cost of EUR 71 million was promoted by leaders , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and house@@ wives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter White said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the county care line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art production of soft f@@ ences .
the goal is to keep the Black Forest open .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a subsi@@ dis@@ ed by the L@@ PR .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the area to be enclosed cannot be fli@@ pper@@ y ( incl@@ ination above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ ds@@ bacher Weimar project in 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disclosure area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump ré@@ gi@@ me , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him , if he had done it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it resor@@ ted to its significance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller told A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem on which you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; miserable tr@@ ash &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miller was not dedicated to literary criticism , making it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ ump USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conflict , because of the meaning of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who used to place their words after her death on the base - knew very well that they performed a high political action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism , portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup , and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atism , which the American flame brings to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has come across something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of the statue is quite , at all , a question of the standpoint of perception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the true sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their statue is speaking to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever want to acknowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their torch should not illumin@@ ate the road , but the hate that is their sole source of power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FIFA World Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ headed Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship title will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that something special is developed in Scotland , and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics have to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at 5,000 m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her Captain speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought naturally , were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ dles in their fifth world champ@@ ionships , says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unbelievable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British squ@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir leads us and set up five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season that included victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champ@@ ionships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being special about team captain is that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is my speech as a Captain ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home @-@ championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the burning of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he le@@ aped in criticism , sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons , who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him , therefore , at the beginning of this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is particularly important , if it is a type like Ho@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a repub@@ lican governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state , and strict adher@@ ence to principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play@@ end his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy , on his side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is considered official and of employees paying with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ing or h@@ asser@@ ting people , which swing online the whi@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , no tro@@ lls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priest quoted the Bible in his post , and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people are taking a position on the same subject , and they are rather dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the Govern@@ ors of the Gover@@ nor called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated sp@@ amm@@ ing attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or del@@ eting a negative comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same , that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official who has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County wounded the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dges James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shouldn &apos;t be so hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beat on its leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ mal@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that suppressed Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he didn &apos;t silence them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope home in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an holds the 25th edition of Scottish senior Open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to En@@ dr@@ usen in the past year , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an avi@@ d advocate of this game , and is proud of his performance here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player home in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was taken from the program in the year after I gained it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on the home base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more if you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really enjoyed playing it again , and I played a solid Gulf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how far it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers at the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) are coming to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , there were still 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections turn out to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and are located reasonably in the time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Fred Hein@@ ze farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected as there is a lot in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic , which obstruc@@ ts the construction work again and again , represents a major problem for the construction company of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red traffic lights and shut @-@ off grids is enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road is closed , and only the buses are allowed to go through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold land
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reign in the peaceful Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also conduc@@ ts her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was adopted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea took part in the eastern part of the island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 hour drive with a rental car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no public transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo trees , and from corrugated board ro@@ oft@@ ops , which were transformed by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very few in@@ dones@@ ian have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no for@@ eigner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to her lively , woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ lexi@@ ble and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an of Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars in a single officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after greater autonomy , Pap@@ u@@ lian demands threaten the golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal country in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we adverti@@ se Every@@ thing &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are particularly popular - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as they happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is too Christian , but demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people are fighting to keep here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local in the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - cost her market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and infrin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fri@@ ghtened children told them , that they should turn their lights on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the soldiers took an impulse to their tone , and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission set fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance , im@@ itating in the circle - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators began throwing stones on police and military posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist@@ ed more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is wearing only one name , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ port@@ edly said that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station , because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings occurred only on the following day , &quot; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passion@@ ed speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he vo@@ iced sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical griev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security Affairs , Wi@@ ran@@ to said that he has set up an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some were in the 90 @-@ s , and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the United Nations for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims , with a gri@@ m un@@ believer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , years later he still lives in fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ ini repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have fear , to discuss the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot the villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a confrontation between the villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company , who refused to get a unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers , who responded by firing warning shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot , and killed one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who was near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to take the officers involved , and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ dder for the Indonesian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the Free Pap@@ ua movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua , forcing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a , fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agriculture is the task of women , each of which can edit four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived at Nab@@ ire airport in greater numbers since the opening of new routes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs there are in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the headquarters of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting of international media remain tense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Pap@@ ua for lack of coordination , even though the rare permission to film was given to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , six p@@ acific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; historically , the same countries have supported the O@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai kis@@ ses , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ ai to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives among the permanent threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ ai as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want justice , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties suffered a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know that they will never give them justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ omo with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a fire occurred in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ floor buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the second fire , which in only two years swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and scre@@ aming the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant named George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) , and the building cooled down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am working on providing accommodation for those concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident may revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from facing , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for isolation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) went through with his great Davis Cup coup at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sports @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles was only supported by two @-@ thirds majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics are preserved to the traditional competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just scar@@ cely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to work on it , to improve the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even after the vote , the proposal had already come to a neutral place after many appeals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new in 2018 , only comparatively small details will be : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next year in the following round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the costs of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements in matters of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media meetings before the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers bring forbidden items into the aircraft , finding out a survey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by air passengers resulted in smu@@ g@@ gling more than 20 per cent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , while accidentally banned knives or other objects with blades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered that they were mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet Charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the respon@@ dents admitted that they were know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 3 percent reported to have carried away items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female surve@@ yed and 3.@@ 7 percent of male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said , I asked people all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods brought through the airport security and how many would have done it intentionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that people , the most likely smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly carry through security , those who fly most frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are often uncertain what fluids they may take , or how much of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to start with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , he has already under@@ lined that a part of the customers has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on revenue growth and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less brilliant number for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Mus@@ k dreamed : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critics have always pointed out , that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations currently commen@@ ce in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all models should be assembled in 2018 - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to mus@@ k , reservations are currently made per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who order today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; should expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new production lines with maximum load capacity even never before in practice .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if there are any delays , then the liability of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the delay of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after being su@@ ed by 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the environmental authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of harmful air pollutants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention the complaint , which was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline , which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for down @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt reported in June to delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfere in local choices or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ uted before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Ad@@ voc@@ ate of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regul@@ ators , which resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the breakdown of regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administr@@ ations EPA often has maintained deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be accused of activists and other activists , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full @-@ powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid politics and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the congress press on a more comprehensive version of o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month , should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Senate , the measure was not yet made to vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states , who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intend to maintain legal pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the Smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting smoke can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ ff &apos;s surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for protecting the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump Government to ban on environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 am invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village , the friends and suppor@@ ter of Tum@@ lin@@ gens have made their concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer premiere : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church on Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wording of the document , in addition to the former parish church , there was also a stunning yard which belonged to the Church or the patron and not the other way round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so people also lived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as seen from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which today still can be seen in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ancient maps dating back to 1600 , under@@ pin historical conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , buried and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associated with this , the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones of the two were broken at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops set up close to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Hel@@ pf@@ ul cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 23 , the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the church tower was left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the New Year &apos;s eight in 18@@ 34 , a storm folded the steep@@ le and the half rus@@ hed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only the tower of the tower , which is still existing today , was preserved as a witness of the 750 years of the history of the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ j@@ ell@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as organizers , the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle cemetery on Sunday , 16 July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium in Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a reception is held in front of the cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows down to the forest , &quot; the organizers set out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the friends and suppor@@ ter of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to the care of home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself , &quot; sees no legal prerequisite for construction and therefore turned to the council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim n@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind @-@ force concentration zone existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the elimination of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim n@@ ette - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve of its formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning rights , the informed consent is still un@@ lawful and can be taken back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the municipal coun@@ cill@@ or decided again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim n@@ ette ; a approval of the district government is still pending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it impossible for the construction of wind turbines to be approved in this place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received by the district of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the circle is taking them to the occasion , to examine the matter again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in regards to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim n@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen has been indirectly involved , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the erection of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly a fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NE@@ W Re plans to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ ab@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , a woman was injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two more people were slightly injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch was driving her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade association and city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract locals to shopping in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers who offer their own city away from the usual supermarket merchandise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , local companies will be presenting their training places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the action does not only target residents of the city and the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparation for commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , Christian König . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry , the Municipal Administration and Trade Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the trade association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with merchan@@ dis@@ ing Sunday , talks with all the business@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also attractive offers on Saturday , and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened or opened again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , all of them would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly wi@@ dened , king had said in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , shared the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mm@@ er@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the suspension of the Chamber of Commerce and many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment by himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two dead , and several injured after explosion at U.S. school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new other people were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine further injured , some of them severely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a wounded person was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building crashed into the explosion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one first missing was later found dead , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the dead , employees of the school were involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an accident , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the holiday season , only a few people stayed in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump Dep@@ ended , Fol@@ lowing Tran@@ scripts of Tel@@ eph@@ one calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and drivers of Mexico and Australia , were published by the Washington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president compla@@ ined about him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this cannot be said of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and disclosed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; that would let him look like a &quot; dump &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump completed the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull . &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ore Ford massac@@ res : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ ison as a call for justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and rum@@ ored to the Ford Bridge from Mo@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver , had reached the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block his way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the mo@@ obs , a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit , took a long turn to his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the occup@@ ants flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man is ro@@ aring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying broke the silence , when a young black man was dragged by the passenger seat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a re@@ position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone in the audience shou@@ ted very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens are coming back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were reported by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really incredible that in all these years there was no single person arrested - although we see them in our congregations , even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia , and a life long civil rights activ@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that a wrong has never been corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bai@@ li@@ ff puts a sheet on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but no one was ever accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on their feet for decades , Ci@@ tiz@@ ens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time to vote for its vote in the elections in the summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately at the same time as the choice stab@@ bed according to the FBI the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett v@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y , and that the baby she wore not came from her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosec@@ utions that had not only been involved in mur@@ ders , removing evidence and distorted the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and when you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual delivery of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and rooted in a kind of deep racism , many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;m going through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director , here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has played the role of the boss clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett v@@ ester , tried their lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the sister scre@@ ams and ur@@ ges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , swe@@ ep away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona responds to the fire .
there is a break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then everyone breaks ( at least , all black actors ) in laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people were &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and precisely there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship replaces the discomfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is busy trying to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , when Ras@@ wan says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repetition finishes violent and fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a wedding dress is about the corp@@ ses of the actors , and Bil@@ lie Holidays fi@@ erc@@ ely leads &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators get sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a couple from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , arrived to see the performance , many just down the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Mal@@ com and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children sit in their heads , record the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per one another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he would remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly , it is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the actors disc@@ ard the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit which the clan member played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did it for a reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the audience joins together with the actors for dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlan@@ ta is chat@@ ting with a black couple who just met them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words , which sen@@ sed the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I really do with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called Police sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks &apos;s court sits at his table in the same room , eating and remember@@ ing citizens &apos; rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he started planning the performance next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the after@@ math is inspiring in a way , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans to Bay@@ reuth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf uses a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic six @-@ storey cou@@ l@@ isse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) displays a damaged street corner including wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car is par@@ ked in which the Rhine Ri@@ ders pose as rock energy , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s guiding principle - money , power and greed - which is moving through his &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhein@@ gold@@ smi@@ ths - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el - Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize like in the &quot; Das Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderfully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ES@@ S seduc@@ es them Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier a corp@@ se into the trunk and enter the ri@@ ot @-@ cli@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the glorious Hagen , which surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ box@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) must believe in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stor@@ my , Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bles himself and articul@@ ated his hands on the Merkel @-@ mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat in casual leisure clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with excitement , the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was awaited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to leave a cell of the pipe concert , and five years later there were great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went underground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is looking forward to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their volunteer year , they work in several places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where everywhere ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I already worked in the open whole day at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now 26 years , i.e. a late @-@ called volunteer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does that come from ?
amount : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then a degree in civil engineering , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was wrong for me , and I want to do something different to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps , really . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and was it like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : I have collected great impressions , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social sciences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will study dual study , probably in the youth welfare state Her@@ ne is a social worker training and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it not a bit unusual , while the volunteer service has several different locations ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably , it is always where you are going to be FS@@ J . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to do it from retirement home to youth work , in all possible facets of social work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could see my own strengths , and see how it really exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different from civil engineering studies ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : well , here it is not about to figure out st@@ ati@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one always has other people in the head , each of which have a completely different story behind them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family , must always be addressed individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : for that , I &apos;m not the guy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 work@@ stations and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will reduce further 3,000 work@@ stations and cut their dividend by 72 percent since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the job cuts , the Director General John Fall@@ on , largely announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction programme a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business which was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which last month sold his stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged since it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , NATO soldiers killed and several others wounded , say officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared a NATO Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombing is the last violent act taken by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of Nato , the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement states that all injured are in a stable state , and are being treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ Arabic , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ bed killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban said they had launched this attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 31 May , massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban from power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the force under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump sums up the number of US troops to support military and police in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public confidence to the government , their policies and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA converts a decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , after which states are obliged to cur@@ b the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 , &quot; and said it would show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine where pollutants are to be measured in part of the country , in order to stipul@@ ate stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 most democratic states , together with Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental expenses imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda driven by Tr@@ ump &apos;s economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efforts , however , triggered the return of the democr@@ ats and nature protection groups that worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal Council wants common room
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ roots decided to establish a common room in the future retirement home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing piece of land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the church community is still part of the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be chis@@ eled by a private investor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are suspended , such a common room , not as a meeting place for the people of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly in the congregation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this respect , there is no cri@@ pple between the legs - as well as a pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer refers to this addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it helps , it passes the body unanim@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which one does not move so much , for that one is now in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m doing it hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room , but absolutely against a public participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy , or even foreign investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but a genuine , in case of doubt market@@ able counter value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request , to find out the resolution , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; when we make the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto the road
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way from Hil@@ den towards Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road to the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Bus@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a passenger car driver , which is in the same direction , has given priority to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the landing fields went on the street , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met with a car , who controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man was thrown into the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered serious injuries , and was brought to a hospital with a hospital ambul@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Bayern München has to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Super@@ cup is taking place without him , David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the staff of German football team Bayern München are getting bigger at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B , trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , from Star to Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; star trail &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Association Observ@@ atory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a planet trail in Göttingen , Germany since 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets the information needs of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members want to set up panels along the planned route , and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase of the year 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interview with St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
information on the boards should be added to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception is important when selecting the location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the star path will be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers learn a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more lou@@ dly than another , although he is considerably far@@ ther away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which con@@ stellation , a selected star can be found and when it is best to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , the association runs the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with a naked eye can be seen clearly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium of Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ chy - the Plan@@ etary Trail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e which forms the interior of our solar system the planet path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet , are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 mil@@ lim@@ eter diameter , while the sun accurately measures 75 meters from the sun to 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last for half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia who were to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds met for the first time on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council light weight champion , to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation super @-@ spring weight champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; What is your champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defended his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga at 7 PM on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate change asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy to reconci@@ le Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year in order to fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said later openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stopped with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow ... I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the co @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show impact , then boxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injuries to tire plat@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost the control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car sli@@ pped to the right of the slope , where he over@@ came and then stood on the roof in the green strip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four in@@ mates , two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed north@@ wards for about an hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; the three chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the def@@ ens@@ ation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to adapt even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three chain should also be further optimised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a gate after a release , the For@@ tun@@ ings don &apos;t want to capture anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain experiences , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still I don &apos;t know how to operate in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm spark@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we can harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t do so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a resol@@ ute start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand with four points on Sunday and can focus on the tro@@ phy we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after six to eight days , Fried@@ helm spark@@ le , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim was cancelled because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Radio and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be slightly fres@@ her , as they couldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Rhin@@ eland , guests from the Rhin@@ eland arrive as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; says radio , whose balance is absolutely positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which you have to hit from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as boss coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , Radio Station wants to not experience its players on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) began testing the tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum procedure , they are supposed to make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish migration authority ( migration verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until today , migration verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; perhaps 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the subject was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det under@@ took the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images are made of knee joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves evaluating the biological maturity of men to see if they were sooner or later than usually passed through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to judge the biological age in this way , is very uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is minor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the works on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , a concrete block of seven tons was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very well in the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Traffic and Transport in Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end of the building is scheduled for October , and it is certain that the schedule is adher@@ ed to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the two other bridges , too , it has now come into the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , took a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an edge fastening , which is also used as an operating path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge can be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way was to run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special feature of this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridges .
particular finger@@ tip sensitivity has required laying lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a glass fibre cable , to which many companies are connected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up of the work , local residents were informed about the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collective pond in direction to Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a lane by means of a traffic light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bacher town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof , &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of the three bridge rec@@ ations amounts to 700 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties represented in the Parliament ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance this day , because the Af@@ D invites a peaceful flag in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24th , and the Vice President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D members , but demonstrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally planned was the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking below the rear - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colourful picture that can be found there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum One World and one of the great organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; German potato salad , which could easily eat the Af@@ D , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police ordered a lot of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel reports , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also doing this : at about 20 o &apos;clock , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the audi@@ torium are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the election of the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police presence was unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , guests at the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police can de@@ press - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher trumpet player Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher &apos;s mon@@ astic Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; meets Black Forest , or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions , and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both unites the desire not only to transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach works in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz ech@@ amber N@@ ils W@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this core of the program was first mentioned in the spring with huge success in Freiburg , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is deliberately incorporated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart for her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bitter@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone whom I have ende@@ avor@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think , I &apos;d played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , critics admitted that they were bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , I have never been confused or hin@@ dered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really felt attacked , sc@@ ared and ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not like to explain her love life : &quot; people expect you to get in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had promised a big announcement at West Virginia Rallye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ bes establishes that he owns coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Repub@@ lican National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather prevent us from doing it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the supervision of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics manager D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , who have been cut away from competition gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to resume Russia again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nine Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and illegal trainers are still free , he said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a funeral ceremony for soldiers that crashed in Mali
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a funeral service in the North @-@ Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers in Mali had thought about a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called the two opposite pilots , however , as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she declared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen died on Wednesday , a week ago in the West African Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guar@@ dian of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral , St. Peter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among them , Hes@@ ens Minister @-@ President Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the chief inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sor@@ es laid down roses , and the relatives were arm in the arm of the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense by Le@@ yen designated the revers@@ ed soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the aircraft of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar , and was one of the first six imag@@ inary drivers of his regi@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers were , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt that the UN Mission in Mali has no doubt : the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance to a country separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not provide any information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want to be a grave next to his wife
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that divided the royal house on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard has already produced a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision , so she continued to communicate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of it , that he was not happy with his title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired , including the title &quot; Prin@@ ted Su@@ pper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the boss of the Danish royal house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the last retirement of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he likes the country , for which he worked for the last 50 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French nobility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his later wife perpet@@ u@@ ated the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy duty in his almost 50 years of reign in the Dan@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hen@@ rik commented on his first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand @-@ critical intellectual , I could not hope in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I seemed to be happy with this position , and not ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swift election of the country , does not want to res@@ ign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Parliament spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the surprising resignation of Green Members from their parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a heavy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous Gre@@ ens Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ur@@ ler , President Bj@@ örn Th@@ ur@@ ler , wants to recommend it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Parliament will be elected regularly on January 14 , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ur@@ ler said that the red @-@ green regional government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l believes it is indispensable that the State Parliament quickly decides its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also provides the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament el@@ ects trust and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be checked in law , &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in peace , one will discuss all the questions if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but somewhat curious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself pointed out , &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she described herself as a trailer of black @-@ green . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the sav@@ our@@ y dep@@ uties for the return of their Parliament mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she has received her land press , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; divided the pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we depl@@ ore the decision made by El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately decided not to vote in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of the Lower Saxon Green Members El@@ ke T@@ wo@@ e to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attitude of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to the voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; the chief of the Socialists and Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly choose the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaving T@@ Westphalia , Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony costs the majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her final vanity and in her fru@@ stration in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ating game and tries to beat out political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD , the strongest force , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how can consumers be protected ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks and answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator , check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states are presenting the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if according to everything we know presently , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer , because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance minister is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has switched on immediately and since the announcement of the concerns of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and the risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the residual hardness of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not market@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
are manufacturing operations and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the current level of knowledge , the production facilities are no immediate fault . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , due to alleged illegal practices of service companies , they must expect economic damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there is too little controllers in the seri@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it only missing on the staff , or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was just the official controls , which revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; precisely for this reason , a consequ@@ ent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ utor in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be found are of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to receive only safe , market@@ able foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the funds produced , manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ f@@ il in keeping food @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all levels , it must be worked rigor@@ ously and with high pressure on all levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the facts are solved quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to influence the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules , aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted editions of European football clubs , will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any consequences will be made for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G can make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power @-@ rich ruler family of Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to deal with legitimate income sources that enable them to even point the break @-@ even point in their activities related to football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that clubs that had enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin themselves , when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to build the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year period of the FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to fri@@ ghten his excessive expendi@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead , and we will certainly intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the discount rate for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first wave of FF@@ P pen@@ alties in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) that was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to out@@ wit their financial views , infl@@ ating their income through businesses associated with the owners of a club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a cat@@ fish company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments made by the 2022 World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup will be am@@ bass@@ adors , and a great manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they discussed the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would violate the FF@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arsen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as a country owns an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , when a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y Board chocolate has produced for Swiss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the cooperation is standing before a possible end : the airline writes the contract anew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on request of the news agency , Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed the report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the products would be insp@@ ected every two to three years , subject to quality control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 17 million small , red white packed sho@@ ck@@ boards spread to 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many applicants , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , Swiss chocolate bars are distributed on board their flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss performed two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers will be spoiled by le@@ aks from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class Air@@ gg@@ i by Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
athle@@ tics - Dis@@ cus Olympi@@ ad Robert Hart@@ ing achieves World Cup final
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , the three @-@ time World Champion will fight for a medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his brother Christoph , Olympic Champion of 2016 , failed in the national championship battle and was able to watch the dis@@ co competition only from the grand@@ stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5.@@ 13 meters wide , qualified for the final battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter ) , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like time is scar@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a promising kind of vegetables that was spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by sti@@ cking on the core of the ga@@ g - actors of middle @-@ aged children play hor@@ ny kids , who will grow up - nevertheless they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casting kann@@ a principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker &apos;s films of the 90 &apos;s as &quot; The Hand That The Cra@@ dle ch@@ elt &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one point a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy malign@@ ant P@@ lot included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ie of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the moments of accidental ma@@ dness which could heat this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider to be his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now recalls a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War by &quot; The Americans &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ v@@ ill@@ ed Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some nice days to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the list of the famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is included - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with six long episodes , it moves away and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been re@@ arranged to a lesser extent , could give his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re better , as Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef always attend the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men , who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that the Western culture can make everything for the food for a feast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong , even with our own younger history and theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blow to the drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office announced on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the officials established large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Italy , two people were arrested in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over 300 police officers were in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , heavy violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in southern Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the major effort was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the investigations , Italian citizens were particularly vulnerable to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fashion lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , noted a report on large gaps in the country of foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; in an analysis published by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to statistics , there are 10 million people registered with foreign nationality , among them 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the data is managed by some 600 foreigners in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data had not been adequately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases data from 1921 had been found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data inputs can slow down reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of sufficiently paid people , EU citizens are also registered that would not have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such wrong assignments , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate measures , &quot; says the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began sending refugee families back to Italy under 16 years of age when they entered the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ru@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it means that BA@@ MF is leading such procedures for families with children - except infants and infants - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching it first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the inclusion and housing of family guarantees , Italy submitted guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) , these commitments are sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU states would send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful recording conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a total of 220 liters of blood from in Ober@@ stra@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available for other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were honored on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now 100 donations in the meantime , distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the community acknow@@ le@@ dges multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood in the meeting of the Municipal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is created and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , &quot; under@@ lining mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the chief editor of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , corn @-@ makers reported from the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K District Manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the change in the theatre house has led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously mentioned Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry to the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 blood donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half as many Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter spend ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened speculation about a rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish , when they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 down to 1.6 % and warned that inflation would continue to rise to just under 3 % in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they realized that in the next few years , interest rate increases would be needed to bri@@ dle the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs might rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h stimulus package , which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks , although it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden the consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest rates , she reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts , adjusted down@@ wards for this and next year , are 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound fell after these news , compared to the dollar and the euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of a rate of interest and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and slight decline in wages , as the tightening is getting worse first before it becomes better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years could not prevent the fall of income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which is part of lower consumption expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years , until this will complete the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors want to end lou@@ dly after businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly well @-@ suited for those in which the existing deport@@ ations proceed and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is intended to prescri@@ be 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September following a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ drug prevention ( pre@@ p ) bi@@ ased before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Supreme Court confirmed that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p , despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crucial new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be the first to be registered and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in the risk of infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take pre@@ p before sexual intercourse , means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such medications can be taken every day , or as two hours before sexual intercourse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who were not successfully treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinics , suitable participants identify which the study agrees , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who live in England and are registered with a GP , can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program will be awarded £ 10 million , and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is widely used , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ p , if targeted to needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September to , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives of many lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks , this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment has turned into a spacious home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne patio - and it is proof of the new design , that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom , Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over one another , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to solve the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre , space and light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important that if you move the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will be selling the floor - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which are therefore helping to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electric outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ er@@ age of some standard , something quite Ama@@ zing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers , because of a $ 500 million real estate empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute about one of the biggest real estate imperialist Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with their mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood since 1973 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the family founded West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S &apos;s portfolio now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in has described in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court record says that , in the value of $ 3@@ 16 million , Col@@ in owns $ 17@@ 6 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Paul , the allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be problematic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first ape da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the Supreme Court &apos;s first hearing took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brothers now are fighting for control of the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an early adop@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop of the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he started the high school when he was &quot; in my last years , when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media took up contact with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and to pull our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father wouldn &apos;t have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current conflict , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece by Re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first working day with senior employees , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump Bel@@ ly House that he wanted to repair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to be persu@@ aded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former electoral advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep tr@@ umps of Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that tr@@ umps of Twitter had ever been &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know about others , that Tr@@ ump T@@ we@@ ets without their intervention would have included more fuel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if his employees manage to keep away from him a few times , their efforts have paid off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no one has consistently aver@@ ted it , that tr@@ ump controversy exc@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO , dealing with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to provide the President for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former junk officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when somebody accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap &quot; in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson is permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump was reading the article , and began asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher also added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the recy@@ cle bin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did this work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still seek influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this summer , the police dispat@@ ched cards to dangerous criminals all over Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are not well @-@ known , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , followed by the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands , with some decided travelers on war , have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their manor houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug out by the Council to prevent their attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry people have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today still more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road , and I am not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident that didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers only to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time , and they even saw a horse in the car park . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior towards the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation where the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of Bir@@ k@@ enhof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is built from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated , and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente Company company lt@@ d. to 13th of April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building offered the district council as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan , in order to secure the area as a hotel location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt , Mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the hotel premises and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object , the group has four houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been building utt@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations will be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the floors were torn down , ceilings broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until March , there is much to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and the director of tourism Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city &apos;s noti@@ ons are identical , with those of the hotel group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just under a million euros , he pays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the external systems are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the public , which is open to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special E@@ vil sets Grand Jury
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Russian affairs around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called grand jury after a report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the Panel received the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sender CN@@ N reported , there was already the first invitation of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between the old son and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to pur@@ pos@@ efully put themselves into the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump Wahl@@ kampf School and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of the investigation is to stand for several men acting in the election campaign as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also recorded more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment under the microscope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ ller Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and asked whether the president might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible break@@ downs and decide whether to be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Grand jur@@ ys are also called In@@ dict@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mostly , they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor , in order to invite people to interro@@ gate under oath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the transmitter CN@@ N , invitations were already issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his team leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were talking with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the exposure shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work , and that if necessary he wants to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the initiation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amid the new revelations , the President of the Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affairs as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his Special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a comment , he did not know anything about setting a grand jury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they usually work secretly , he emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any action , which accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey told me three times , that not against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed in this respect , it was said in the explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this root , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he refused to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Com@@ ey asked for a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the investigation , the president is under great pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later assigned President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic sen@@ ators on Thursday presented legislative draft , after which the Special Agent could no longer be dismissed as easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ ctic : giant ic@@ e@@ berg moves in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely se@@ ven@@ fold size Berlin has loos@@ ened from the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for polar and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now driving to the north and possibly need two or three years until it melted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant in the past three decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no danger for people , not from him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg , the data is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a background background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ gul@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ gul@@ s is located south of South America , almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xing and abor@@ tion was disturbed several years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is crum@@ bling there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking a lot about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ pans are in danger , as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be broken down if a piece breaks down at a key location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the melting of sh@@ ell@@ fish and ic@@ e@@ berg will not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and em@@ it ice as much water as it results after melting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaci@@ ers flowing directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small degree , the British research project writes to the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ pans is the fourth @-@ largest hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e of Antar@@ cti@@ ca according to A@@ WI population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it breaks off on a regular basis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientist Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though these researchers do not bring down the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , many of the Eis@@ sch@@ el@@ ves of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been crushed in recent decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this long tip of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the polar area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the temperature increase contributed to the decline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus en@@ umer@@ ates the areas where the temperature increases the fastest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U wants to take home st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new positions in the administration took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the administrative office in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very popular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year , some 6@@ 20 applications were registered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , and meet the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration should develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and externally , expos@@ ing concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an apprenticeship initiative , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that sounds like a good approach , sometimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the circle has to do with personnel problems , which you did not know earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Competition of Public Emplo@@ yers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age @-@ related reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the highest time for action is therefore not to remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Leder , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had long ago caused a terrible surprise in the C@@ ret@@ an , when he publicly challenged the staff costs and the remaining parties ba@@ ff@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be reviewed which enable a exit from the municipal employers association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a suitable solution in the short term , the circle administration with the unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should seek a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials , as it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sal@@ aries are exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards career years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ rix and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work further , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with human traffi@@ ckers in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself in extensive alle@@ gations by the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization said in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised once we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is assumed that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered directly from men &apos;s traders , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that the ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least such a meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occupation is suspected to over@@ ride the authority of the Italian coast guard , rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a have to have an Italian police officer in charge of monitoring their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far been willing to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring significant changes or disabilities to their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up is Nobel Peace Prize @-@ Organisation Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy declined sharply in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who left these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine festival from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle , above Dei@@ des@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream planes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , the viewpoint was set at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ ppy &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the air inhal@@ ation plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga upgrades for e @-@ sports
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through wind and weather over the stadium rock@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognized the first federal bodies , which are increasingly engaging in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Board Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , one could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga sponsor@@ ship to Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during e @-@ sports , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup FIFA will focus on competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual sports , leag@@ ues have long been established in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and by 2022 , e @-@ sports is already part of the official program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but is it all about a kind of sport ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , In@@ go F@@ rob@@ y dealt with the question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it &apos;s competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that you find in classic sports such as increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a positive way , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players are internationally on the move , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study by the Business Consul@@ t@@ ancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , many countries are already ahead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport betting company Uni@@ crown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe , too , some things are happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs have meanwhile been obliged to set up an E @-@ sport department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B Management Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is no longer enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot cling to it that only in football everything remains as it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poison @-@ eggs - E@@ gg alternatives for cooking and baking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , almost all federal states are affected by the sc@@ andal around pois@@ oned eggs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted and all the eggs are taken out of sale throughout Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in shelves , only eggs should be taken , which demonstr@@ ably not contain fi@@ do@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , because of the lyrics , who press Con@@ rad Roy for suicide , condemned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she has encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June due to the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday during the hearing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter was standing with tears in his eyes , folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor of the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she is totally depl@@ orable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said he didn &apos;t find that her age or maturity or even her mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ cky &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there was &quot; no day , in which I would not enter the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , told her that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person , with whom I was together every day since I was born , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy in 2014 was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages reveal that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang up , jump from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent during the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , &quot; Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was paid by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from any press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the case has divided the legal opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was a member of her British mate in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ myself : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup , is no accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern tr@@ umps a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation is not hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something was different at his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ myself immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made his way to the arm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as Bayern @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the character of the coach could also suggest Kim@@ i , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s youth players , de@@ but@@ lers and especially from holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , sugar is best distributed to those who want to make a lot of herbs that you want to keep in a good mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so who was chosen to take the legacy of L@@ ah@@ m , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was running as a Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the right rear , this is now his position , the white bond on the arm did its rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Kim@@ myself worked in this starting formation , like the one who can best take the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave instructions , trying to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ idal so , to over@@ play his lack of fitness , Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil come out to get out of the services of the Asia journey ( folded also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus not to drop neg@@ atively in their first appearance at the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least that worked very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sü@@ le was running alongside Kim@@ myself , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both operated confi@@ dently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the famous Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game @-@ building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he also showed a decent performance during the debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual this Bayern world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Ru@@ dy was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but certainly six or seven interviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i said , after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the New . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ aba motivated O@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has reported on Twitter just before the game , and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wish all the best . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bayern @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire is a club colleague of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captain Schn@@ itz@@ beck and happily with our La@@ dies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian soccer team of the year and champ@@ ions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the famous Bavaria @-@ D@@ us@@ el might well need our ladies too , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister , Economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings tempo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is evident after more than a year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously , the old Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ ser interfer@@ es with the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest revers@@ al of the turn@@ around looks natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning procedure until 2021 is supposed to be construction law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ bel@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the German traffic plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to put the distance in operation in December 2020 , says Ministry @-@ Spe@@ aker Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competitive companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) , as of Wis@@ sing , aims to increase the Rheinland @-@ Pf@@ alz @-@ Label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports losing for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing also has an open ear for people wanting to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; envis@@ aged is a premium of 1000 Euro for the passed master test and 2500 Euro , when graduates get independent within ten years after master training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planned road construction is to create facts quickly , at the same time it is out of the country by the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry of Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set up knowledge in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Commerce expects to grant more orders to external offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comm@@ enting on calculations of the Court , the CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf proposes more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , Frank nat@@ us is expecting a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , regional companies only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey with a score of 3.4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stub@@ born internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the wind farm Pro Wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become a president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she once again cleared the field after four months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers see themselves confronted with a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer software to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a re@@ vocation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but nitrogen ox@@ ides , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising exhaust f@@ umes produced by diesel vehicles , also take on what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies , ignor@@ ing the issue of the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the companies try to avoid the mistake of Volkswagen , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but driving back to normal driving conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , having accused Audi to have a system installed to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen &apos;s inclusion in the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to the benefit of Volkswagen , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that even the Is@@ ar visitors take part , a raft takes place in Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who takes it on Saturday again to the Is@@ ar , who will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this is not a usual raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the paper wants to clarify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the raft , one sees a big inf@@ otran@@ sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows a tr@@ ash mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; ... the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to be sharpen@@ ed as a protected game of wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer , raft over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ens , and laughter against the suffering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most widely published carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the rab@@ ies of his figures are his trademarks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian is still writing and works on a film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first years as an artist , he offered himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - what frustr@@ ated him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , the artists of cities were inspired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures lie in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits on the table , working every day for nearly ten hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ us@@ cu@@ dd@@ les and watches continue to find a lot of spread worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protag@@ onist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island , &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand foot@@ ers as counter @-@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film that will come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced in a wor@@ dless mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions which are reminiscent of drought and disease @-@ borne insects , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , make great head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the farm research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence has been exposed to the effects of climate change in spring and much more in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf @-@ cal@@ ves , and there are many of them in very dry weather . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the little village of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 years of existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Saturday and Sunday , the highlight of the festival is a medieval festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traders , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ers or a land repository should be able to experience in the inner city these days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ ol@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings are sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no pause between violence , and while in the whole country the bodies are pil@@ ing up : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has been under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the latter is their editor and inspir@@ er of Ri@@ ol@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere present - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; wearing T @-@ shirts expos@@ ing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a Son@@ ata Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Fe@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is still more tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was shot by his car and 12 times was shot on him - presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car , damaged it nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ eums for drug roy@@ alty , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mistake was to do not comp@@ el Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country with its own security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had survived so long , that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ ol@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the problem of intoxic@@ ation , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting and sales and advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the creation of Ri@@ ol@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever they lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J @-@ award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take the task that you as a journalist - either this or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fe@@ odo@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ n @-@ bird , who was flu@@ ent like a do@@ ck@@ worker , who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine be his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best , and thus remain alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ ol@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ stri@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero , and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days ago became known that Spyware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were commissioned by the State government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building , in a medium @-@ size neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the Gover@@ nor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porters went into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ ol@@ ce has shr@@ unk to three main stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the murder of the brother of the former well @-@ known Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the public spending , focused on the govern@@ ors &apos; hom@@ etown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which dominated almost the whole century all political levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; gu@@ essed a military raid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez said the best informed information about the kidn@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all over the country , journalists have become lou@@ der , having written down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and kill them because they said the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has since asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; surrounded &quot; by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; media fan group has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ stri@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did according to the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z was publicly addressing drug cart@@ els with a leading article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists have fled from their home countries , or even from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a painful decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who remain back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that drug trafficking is terri@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Fe@@ odo@@ ce at the Bürger@@ stei@@ g sat in front of the office and drank beer , as once all their teleph@@ ones began to hum@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ eted riv@@ els and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan resort had left 19 confirmed dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are waiting nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the polic@@ emen who kept watch , to see if they were in readiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Fe@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee urged me to send them to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to escape its enemies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue if there is a fri@@ ghtening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mining worker have been so well received , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even realize that his fla@@ ky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said , she could have had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; referred it as &quot; the retained arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs that has ever been found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er living in the middle of the round@@ about between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has astonished researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy ground cl@@ ump@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you b@@ link only a little with the eyes , you might almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have allowed it to better blend better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er has made head@@ lines in May and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amazing conservation of the exempl@@ ar enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of the animals living today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but most contemporary animals , who use counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of the C@@ ret@@ era must have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sun@@ k on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ cope is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early round@@ about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just send a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the era was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the King of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the scientific journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the museum , it is the retained arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , prot@@ ru@@ ding from its shoulders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was swept through western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the sub@@ marine cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well received , that the skin remains always cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured boards along the din@@ osau@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preserved remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured boards , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many injured
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous injured , kilometers long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , around 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , around 17.@@ 00 hrs there were almost 30 vehicles between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , including trucks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , no information is available about the exact number of the injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was light to moderate injuries , a police spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the accident site , a large amount of emergency vehicles was charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the direction of travel in Munich , a total of ten kilometres long was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , it also occurred on the counter@@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fire department noted the characteristics of the vehicle engineers , who now have to count on sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : you sit in the train , sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or one is deep@@ ening into his work , and has just a brilliant idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then : mu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the conductor , w@@ akes an uns@@ af@@ e or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ticket inspection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the times of interrup@@ tions are over , soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , Deutsche Bahn is testing the free ticket control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply by phone , you simply confirm that you take your seat and thereby invali@@ date the ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , a test operation is running on two tracks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; refers to the ticket evaluation without any conductor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be able to use them , you need to meet some requirements : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you have to book an online ticket , what already most passengers do anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also have to purchase it via the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way ticket booking anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation is published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices , that passenger X is in the train and occupied the booked seat Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ticket control at Place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you can sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without a ticket check by our train crew , the DB navig@@ ator simply checks himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to train their travel time in a personal way , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of Deutsche Telekom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who often travels , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket checks are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the competitors does not have all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either the credit card or ID card is missing , or otherwise a document that you have to assign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passengers , leading to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in checking their own tickets and taking the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , only a small number of test customers can use the new service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an activ@@ ist , the answer to the question was to learn : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken to its core . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed at her tim@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s vibrant body , which was stretched out on the street and remained there four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ferr@@ ell thought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but death was nothing new to them , and their community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos from the police station and people , the shou@@ ted , and from a man who claimed his father &apos;s father , who said a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman told his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ferr@@ ell remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was angry and wept . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she booked a return flight , and went home the next day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened in the following three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which exist in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Ferr@@ ell with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a fitting crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that she had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black experience and black condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must know , and it must be seen and raised in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution know and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally experience no blat@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black women child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there Ferr@@ ell and her daughter settled with a local business@@ man , who made lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they prepared bags , and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeks later , Ferr@@ ell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one question came from Ferr@@ ell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often white - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on were not centered , and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt @-@ mates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought Ferr@@ ell closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are being portrayed , as I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; was not a Messiah leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt naked , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , laughing as she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the in@@ humane of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Ferr@@ ell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , even though it was at the forefront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman standing so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long ago , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though they are not built for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation 2009 , spl@@ its the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic can hardly be cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit gallery say , &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) or simply &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery is attracting more customers into the city , the other shops also benefit from the fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the construction work , there will be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building , with the possibility to sit outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would wish that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other cities , there is also this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall can settle in the gallery , depends on the amount of the rent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping @-@ column in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of that , there are enough in our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see , how many shop shops are vac@@ ant here - some for months and years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping centre only by major firms , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for retailers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall suits me not .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , where should the farmers market hall be built during construction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , when the bit Gallery is actually coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the gh@@ o@@ sts bit gallery , before , to drive all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a shopping centre that is empty , nobody needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - which hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the inc@@ isions out of the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former Secret Service Analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after publishing as a secret diplomatic commentary on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was unified in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ minister and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which could be extracted by Mann@@ ing , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , had already been convic@@ ted about identification as a woman in 2013 , among them six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the prison her picture was suppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in that , the artist produced portraits of strangers made of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette smu@@ dge and ch@@ ewing gum , by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while they were in jail , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg declared a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she couldn &apos;t visit at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use became an un@@ equal friendship , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even created one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which would have fores@@ een a future in which the president would convert Chel@@ epa verdict and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand , was a welcome type of happy meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Tr@@ ump sums up a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things , she said that things happen to happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded an end to &quot; automatic dis@@ integration whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hopefully our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in one &apos;s own room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic story . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , how she emerges with a hands @-@ free phone in his hand out of the disciplinary powers of the United States like King Kong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they put forth your words , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter they wrote to me , &quot; said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be anticipated in the comic book , but when it should do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ters that gather as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was also target @-@ oriented , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which her genetic h@@ ap@@ ologies were written with pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had her at the wall but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also hidden behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University , sought for killing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a country@@ wide human race is going on for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who was looking for suspect after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ ying ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department , states that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2007 , La@@ ying is an associate professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that they are now at risk and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked , and want him to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that something had happened in apartment 100@@ 8 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police described the scene very cruel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear , whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that la@@ the and war@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand Plaza &apos;s management team has published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background , resear@@ ching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Vice @-@ President Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map for compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list stipul@@ ates that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mut@@ ations agree with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point of r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 , as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als of WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
they shared the company groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a pure precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed by any health impairment , it was said in the message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have demonstr@@ ably been tested negative on fi@@ pro@@ - containing anti @-@ lice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with its customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people out of the outside for help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is at the growth , to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to offer surveys , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to handle the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , Co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel at the age of three , with G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap Sur@@ ve@@ ys and Sur@@ ve@@ ys of particular teams , it offers a heat card of the company which shows the most complaints and which managers have low approval results , so that you can drill down why . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment when those who have spoken , were punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , after the final technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the U@@ ber fin in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the warmth cards of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a company is found that is poorly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems posed by managers , who were sitting in offices in cities or states , can be identified and addressed more quickly like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who conduc@@ ts the Risk Management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies knew that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring charges for using their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of venture capital investors , who supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gl@@ itter secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its entire finance to $ 60 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated , and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be in a company that makes their voices heard and that the work that you do is worth it , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve ren@@ ders if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the analytics tools of third promise to increase commitment and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the experts of the workplace culture , the data on employee engagement is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , this can be dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4.000 discussions , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow your staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add communication training to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and hopes that in a long run , this leads to better binding of workers in an industry that is well @-@ known for high turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it goes on 23 o &apos;clock , as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have pulled out their tri@@ ch@@ ops , and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day , where the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as held six playing times in West wood practical exercises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 before the beginning of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M , September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the change in the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply squee@@ zed it , they plac@@ ate further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , which is already cleared with foot@@ balls , will not be an easy task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a cleared one that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then choose to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit messages from third parties and display their results below the original fee , the world &apos;s largest online social network reported on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false noti@@ fications and to send them to factor inspec@@ tors that may show results of the fact test from the original article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main stak@@ es for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up of the presidential elections in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; connected article , &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a Castle in the History of England
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was visible in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy sitting in the Main@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become the inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des and a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac steering ie@@ wi@@ cz , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 - a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the im@@ print on the page of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters still smell like smoke , because at that time a fire was lit for the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , I love Archive ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have rated my welcome greetings a little &quot; ) all this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ o@@ sities of the castle - such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape experts , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to worry about the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent , &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to appear on a broader base in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who has built the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rol that the family Dar@@ r@@ ell hid during the English Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell depic@@ ts his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery which was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the men seemed to be quite Ga@@ un@@ er , always pay debts and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ zin@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ alled by nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle clo@@ aked in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the announcement of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Thursday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday at the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on their website that is released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to make it clear , that some things are better than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we believe that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizen , we are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all@@ u@@ sive promise , one that gives the city a unique unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign , a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts reviews and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first glance , a normal procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meetings , the pres@@ idency of the government also took part in the five Vice @-@ ministers , as well as the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the military , the government draws the re@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y have been dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan was fired in 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 10.000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 people who were allegedly involved in the coup attempt , this week was negotiated in Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was called a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely cleanse the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which among other things mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the pil@@ low of soldiers for soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale im@@ pedi@@ ment in the army and the security forces continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan fired further 7@@ 3@@ 95 officers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it seemed that Erdo@@ gan has t@@ amed the military . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gener@@ als were earlier than the lords of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times , they discussed their role as guar@@ dians of the secular order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform objectives of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , &quot; the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , in the alliance after cleansing doubts , there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and do billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by giving the United States the way citizens from other countries will see Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent the chain migration , and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for rac@@ ist shuttle
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , the future of the rac@@ er has been fought over and over again - now it is planned to go very fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the marine track on which the tourist train goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the rac@@ er sh@@ utt@@ les in the long run , construction work will begin on the route according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the Il@@ men@@ au race track , the country acknow@@ le@@ dges this especially for tourism , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at about 2.5 million euros , he paid the costs for the repair of the route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this sum , the country is 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future by the country , will be voted definitely , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia train , as operators , agree on the technical details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the timetable , the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the race platform shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the race platform shuttle is a rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g , especially among tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot plant , whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the track is also in parts strongly b@@ auf@@ äl@@ lig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as you thought it cannot be more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take its ascent seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modern se@@ d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin , which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ets have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the real B@@ oti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible &quot; war@@ ms the True Compan@@ ion website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the day , she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features , the all@@ usion to rape , when one passes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its formation and its increasing refin@@ ement point to somewhat darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most men will of course not keep having sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices its increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what perme@@ ates the boundary zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until the free market gives them permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots exist in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ved to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images that ent@@ ail swal@@ lowed bodies and the ej@@ ected eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their gro@@ wers want them to feel human@@ ely , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cannot separate themselves from their companion , or simply go away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to express it in the language of 2017 , ma@@ ids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sl@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a tru@@ ism of the dump era , that the political divisions that pol@@ arized US voters have split families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all told us all supposedly to burst our filter bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less noticed is the power of tr@@ umps , families to bring together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ minded poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the repub@@ lican relationship with which they fought for decades for politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the setting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens won &apos;t be killed one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is still a fri@@ ghtening long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear as a notion of heart@@ iness in comparison to its standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ mp@@ ed and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed no Swiss Cot@@ tage - the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Central Park car@@ ousel is still a strange magic experience since two two @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it &apos;s the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping money - this to buy something about the counter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I we@@ ary got the experience to spread my credit card with five stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us , with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts in his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder , following an appeal by prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death lashing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by pouring it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der , who hid in the cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is too cau@@ tious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the quad@@ rants were dischar@@ ged from F@@ oot and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen for holidays and secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of the students will go to the secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 students of the four classes elected a young eagle under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ ods from his chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the hope of making him a chicken , the eagle , spread out on a high mountain , spread out his wings and s@@ wore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , who carried the cylinders to the bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , said Mr Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wished each quad@@ ric@@ ist , that he felt accepted in his new school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ sgiving was followed by the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps back to the school pupils and the parents of the parents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen time now is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years of teaching , they only de@@ grade students very reluc@@ t@@ antly , because it was a really great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , eight first @-@ users are already registered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arrested two Bulg@@ arians on illegal camping in Greece
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally camp@@ ed people was arrested by the police , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation was underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV , that the Bulg@@ arians were later released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened the control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , having significant fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry said that the Court could impose a fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they aim to improve exhaust emissions of cars from emissions classes Euro 5 , and partly Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , the software updates handled are optional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schumann @-@ Software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Railway Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler has informed us to write any affected person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its framework . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the retro@@ fitting go as a whole ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impact of the company &apos;s commitment , as well as from political pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers are not acting on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the workshop , the conversion itself could take only three to four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what are drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there a massive rise in prices of Euro @-@ 4 cars , now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ACE advises , with a sale yet to wait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize giving to President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the honored scholars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will arrange a reception together with his wife Mel@@ ania on the award ceremony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the award winner Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , has already announced to ren@@ ounce the participation in the gala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; New York Times &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - and even depri@@ ve them of the means - and it bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphas@@ ised , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clear her point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kennedy Center named after the former president , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the former winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make the city life worth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to retirement next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the place is already written , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker City Buil@@ der has been a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells of varied , but also demanding tasks that await his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , it is aston@@ ish@@ ingly surprised that there has been no application profile yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the earliest possible time , the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , taking notice of the regular notice periods - will be enough time for a revision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative community as a lower building rights authority , the applicant must instruc@@ t appropriate degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this function , the city wants to keep in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they could no longer fill it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but citizens are close to the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good company climate as well as a good mood among the authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 30 years in the office , some significant projects have accumulated and the W@@ acker looks back with pride . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low @-@ ho@@ fen parking place have been initiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium rehabilitation is still subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will book about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a city building master , there is a great room for manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s own farm and gardening course , it can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces are often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a historic monument , it is important to have an eye on what is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high level of responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , everything runs through my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who wants to inherit Roland W@@ acker should be able to demonstrate a completed academic degree as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree with field of architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) includes civil and civil engineering , construction planning , mining activities , municipal estate , building yard and urban gardening , as well as the civil construction supervisory authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bike thrown on leader@@ ships : South rail track closed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the rail track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ last Road ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were damaged so severely , that the approaching freight train had to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them for the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the scene , a ro@@ sy wheel@@ er and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a book of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch about the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves into great danger , and also threatened the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the costs for the rail traffic , there could also be don@@ ors of rail customers to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage was rec@@ tified on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South Railway Line could be run without disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just under ten passenger trains had dropped off Friday morning , two of them entered the district traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freight trains were not cancelled , but they were delayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ hea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the victim is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in food , do not penetrate the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells that are able to trigger infections , are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if equilibrium is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in experiments , a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium inside their bow@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacteria species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an nutrition tolerant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , if the same system is also beneficial in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was looking for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced and found six bacteria species present in mice with the immune cells , but were lacking in mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to understand how the bacteria appeared to the immune system , the scientists called L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabol@@ ism , known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; José M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the middle @-@ field player on Wednesday night he made his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 40 million Po@@ und signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday and impressed as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and only made 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started the Avi@@ va stadium in M@@ our@@ in@@ ho for the start of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did not wish three other new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; three of its four priority commitments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , for that I thank the club , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have had great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner , in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State Washington , drawing in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. State Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner through the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new grav@@ estone for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD chief , S &amp; D Prime Minister , before elections , always looked to Berlin with some concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only no fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the League - was the most important wish of the electoral fighters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counter@@ wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were low strokes .
one after the other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has pl@@ ung@@ ed into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens @-@ German Executive Officer Michael Kell@@ ner called on the under@@ statement of Lower Saxony , El@@ ke T@@ westen , to give her mandate back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear counter@@ f@@ eit of the voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen immediately has to give her mandate to her mandate , &quot; said the Federal managing director and campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ gh@@ tens an SPD electoral champion , when the new hip message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing on the CD@@ U without their own government majority after crossing the green dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the misery began with the un@@ expectedly sharp defeat at the Saarland election in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blue eye , no longer , the comrades were reas@@ sured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was then - and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the ropes , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comrades , in the weeks after , lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ped up again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then when they had just begun new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD administrative chief , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and because in crisis communication , he did so pretty much wrong about what could be done wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the VW @-@ gas aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has long been critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the survey values were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , or maybe because of that , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the Bund over the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they let him do it , as they promised to stabil@@ ise the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets with the internal force of the Lower Saxon Green Party basically no fault . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz did not at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for now , comrades , comrades , try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the absurd parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anism T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Mr@@ s T@@ wo@@ e puts their own car@@ eers over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Head of Party Left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. T@@ westen is not elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxony member continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD member parliamentary group , compla@@ ins an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U MPs will fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called on to clarify the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there has been more , or it has given further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funding for Or@@ tsk@@ ern III
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to rehabil@@ itate his home in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives spoke city development on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler also gave a review of what happened so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1991 , there has been in sensitive rehabilitation areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the restructuring area II of 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the present renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is also important to promote the interior development and not only open up new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the governing president of Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum of funds was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 Euros were from the country , the rest of the church sensi@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area come about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate the Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area at all interest , to rehabil@@ itate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , the regional borders could then move again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge represented Martin Keller and Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which frames would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving residential and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is per plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the rehabilitation area would finally be defined as a statute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grants period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , until September of this year , the survey would only be carried out once , within the scope of which the participants were able to fill out a questionnaire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , the provisions of the statute should be made possible in order to begin the renovation in the coming year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann concluded that every Commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about evaluating and deciding on urban development , when rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the respective plot , there will also be a remedi@@ ation note in the basic book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphasized , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and development arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it is about the structural condition and the renovation potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , new building measures are not eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , first grin@@ ds first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no funding will be required for later &quot; reservation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ tsk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a restoration &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British invent@@ or himself has a micro@@ chip , to come in house and car with a hand movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory firm in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip , and takes only 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn event for an event produced by American manufacturing in the last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the information provided by the military to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire fighting car from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and remained so long until the tur@@ f was ev@@ acu@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the note adds that if depar@@ ting from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original air@@ crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked , whether the event might hurt the destiny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus for reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he advoc@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of airplane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President is obliged to use it for the journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , their use only for a photo operation is unusual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages describing the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to set off US president at the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was counted in the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew an additional 11 hours to &quot; non @-@ Pres@@ idential Committ@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers did not over@@ take the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility , in Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates involve personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs but also take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and sh@@ attered with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga enters the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow from 11@@ am in Kiel , at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite five games and still flaw@@ less balance sheet , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga gained the sense of the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at any rate , team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just on the back positions , I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for class and stability at the S@@ V , above all imports from the high North . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to assignments in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ska ( all Denmark ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fren@@ ch@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , which is currently active at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella Fren@@ ch@@ man , is the first to be in this season at the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castill@@ o , with the White @-@ Russians , An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski , was still on the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again put the team back into the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the trainer around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills up Ka@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t work when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tightening the sanctions against Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , Congress wrote a few &quot; un@@ constitutional rules , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ iled against the US offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , investors from the local O@@ MV are concerned , which together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership Nord Stream 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the threat of Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump must even raise the sanctions by Executive Order to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could defl@@ ect and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer proves , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x hasn &apos;t gone by for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company , &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el - Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head ; P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) is in charge of the Mexican connection and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the type , American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support war on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aid
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city organ@@ ises the K@@ ita @-@ lunch , again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with fixed contact persons for the children , and a assignment to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens , the clock is turned back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head in the field of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooked will continue except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task , and provides fresh chill@@ ed chill@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last kit@@ ten year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 days of the week are lunch at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 part @-@ time employees have a kitchen service from 1 September : they supplement the meals supplied , complement them with salad , raw foods and fruits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the size - there are two groups , as well as seven groups - decide about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen helpers are now firm to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , there is also a healthy diet and cooking lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team , however , is useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning the car@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power - has also the charm that it gave rise to the cost comparison between own reg@@ ression and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much the weight of some 750 people in the area of education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , Chief of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban issued threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international martial arts to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be transferred peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

men try to au@@ gment 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stopped with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s cell phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused , but went on with her friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to grab the cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without loo@@ t , the duo fled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one union would like to make Mc@@ Cain &apos;s long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow over the long @-@ term commitment to production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company has kept silent about the future of investments in the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 500 people work in the plant , which is next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urged to express concerns that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the metrop@@ olitan area Glas@@ gow - an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising living cost and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross won a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to the company &apos;s commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives should be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page of La Liga may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not refrain from pursuing N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution , having given an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ana Executive Board insi@@ sts that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but three years ago , the football world was warned by the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to subscribe to one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to break down under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders had deliberately thrown a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the estate number 30 , causing damage to the vehicle for damage of more than 200 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he met a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade and tou@@ red the guard rails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au , heading towards Le@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to switch to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the control plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the passenger car material damage was created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued its journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the accident , it can be good that the car driver didn &apos;t notice the accident at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 , the police are asked to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves strain on Pope &apos;s brother , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; declared by the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the modified Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would greatly assist the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false estim@@ ation of the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it should be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepare the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis , &quot; We are happy to go to the church and that is a dev@@ out eating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows a very normal pedago@@ gical remedy had been , &quot; to be finished with nau@@ ghty children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with reports on abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely un@@ ju@@ stly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the reminder book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ esh@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the lawyer , Ulrich Weber , by the B@@ ish@@ um Regensburg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high plau@@ sibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , many cases of physical and psychological violence have been used by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially with a high level of emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be more violent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other def@@ endants , many victims were estimated that many victims were estimated to be the general Hum@@ anity of R. and , in many cases , even bring positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thinks of its opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students raise their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible in the public when a domain record didn &apos;t bring any top performance musi@@ cally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as his bi@@ ographer , how do you evaluate this final report ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is dedicated especially to eight pages , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspected ac@@ compli@@ ce or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , too , took place outside of their sphere of sphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , it is possible to reproach him too late or have the first hints not taken seriously enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger gave an excellent testimony , described it as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who nour@@ ished the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his great emotion@@ ality , which also led to sudden out@@ breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also gave ear @-@ files to the hair or ears , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to his honour , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly dre@@ ad@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one wonders if it is not more of his famili@@ arity and his role as brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media just rus@@ hed to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is , the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , in connection with the report , much was reported on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also accused of any involvement or co @-@ involvement with regard to sexual abuse ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have committed themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one concerned representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem with the education of sexual abuse , however , is that most victims remain silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they were not even entrusted to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral conductor who , professionally , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it ... even for really absurd , to assume that they have opened up in@@ sist@@ ently and more clearly or even more than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , confidence teachers , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that one talks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of every sympathy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he can &apos;t be accused either , not prevented him or brought him to the display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there is no reason to link up its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ row &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the former master builder Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed with a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that is , in turn , a mis@@ use of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is , namely , clean separate : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say once , other benefits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers suffered and suffered , were all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with whom Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he didn &apos;t get the boys to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ ar gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , like most of the witnesses , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ ar gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a lot of discipline , but not any sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; many victims are estimated to be the general Hum@@ anity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , at most the reproach remains to have stolen away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first time 1970 / 71 when he started to establish himself , and from the events at a school , where he was not working and responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut his ears in front of the states ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he points out that the school will continue to be practi@@ sed in the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as testing fin@@ es were banned in Bavaria too long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , they were in a legal grey zone , as each of us probably knows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one cannot say that he had always looked away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in 1980 , the prison sentence was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards , to the time being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are historians talking about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall@@ out of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the danger of judging the past of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of inno@@ c@@ ence and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all aw@@ ful , and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. , to draw ear @-@ files and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when physical punishment was forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of its Regen@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played with you for the book , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of testing also become a language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI told from his perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , I did not know that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to go on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bis@@ cuits and candy alone , one does not make a big singer and stand before every success right in which field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a person , you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thoroughly and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , from whom one could not imagine that he could do something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regularly get in touch with him , like many former dom@@ inal cats , 23 years after his retirement , visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , most dom@@ inal cats are thank@@ ful to him that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them to the world of music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but still a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up and worship them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once again clearly : all that is presented to him are educational methods which were on the agenda at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be happy , that we have long been overcome this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the evil intent that stands behind , only too obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably wouldn &apos;t know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
