28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local shopping centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corp@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided into San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder , and investigations are underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , announced that Frank , who previously worked as a chef in Boston , had married his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were shocked and destroyed by death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team who works like a close family and we will miss him , &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this difficult period , our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are with Fran@@ ks family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone , who would hurt his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combining his way with his family was to always cook something for us to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the brother , who sw@@ am with the stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ sharpen@@ ed diamond , who sh@@ ined every day bri@@ ghtly , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has the information , will be asked to invo@@ ke the SF@@ PD critic under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has made Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from the outside label , which with me and the reality usually have little to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have no desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it , that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of a television with loose de@@ br@@ is and mexican food , says it in the magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they bring the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be totally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is no child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film will be on August 25 , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for some altern@@ ation with some colleagues on the beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the for@@ aging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with that , the riding career ended again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his family , he could lead his family to the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even shoot for photo purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and therefore also at CH@@ IO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a small gala , German sports aid handed over the Golden World Py@@ ramid to the man from An@@ hausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in prizes , it does not lack the lik@@ able sports@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , silver bay leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the Queen Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Aachen , he met the first award winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for athle@@ tic successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the double US master winner was recorded in the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , Hans Werner Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the pioneer Er@@ hard Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
clinics and Tr@@ umps Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement , both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are , however , in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state , the role of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to hold that in doubt rather small , and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate it , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely return regulations , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged odds and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in that need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton speak almost verb@@ ati@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate , however , announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies , and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , on Tr@@ ump , party @-@ internal discussions could be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants , and drive up coal mining in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate agreement wants to termin@@ ate it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far from each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade - but simply protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather in the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his critics point to him , that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost to everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has put her little son in her arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with great eyes , he looks curi@@ ously into the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his mother star@@ es at the table top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the executive director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few de@@ centralised accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich lady &apos;s help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no men , neither as visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them to Europe as a hope carrier , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal themselves secretly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their native country they have had experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the flight , this goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a bottle of water for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who think that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , single women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and mis@@ used at worst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to the fact that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the North of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many women are so accustomed to saying nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about what is experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , requests B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the shelter of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether they knew a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ ks , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ians too , fle@@ eing women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ ks , there are in some common shel@@ ters or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or men and women stay together , there can be - continued - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush , which gives it to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

assistance doctors strike : demands for new measures for work
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ uties of the assistance doctors have called their union to approve new work @-@ fighting measures in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council , to approve more work for action from the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that the ministers would have agreed to deal with the concerns of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , assistance specialists and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was rejected by 58 % of its members , who voted in the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have remained , causing the treaty to be rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and demand official re@@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today provided a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures beginning at the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ ten@@ tions led to the fact that assistance specialists in the year six times strike , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the BM@@ A assistance physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands , and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gil@@ ded Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Putin sm@@ iled narrow@@ ly , and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even be improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if nothing had happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state did not forget anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was flood @-@ burning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin issued and accused Ankara , Russia to be in the back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to rebuild the Vet@@ rop@@ ack is difficult , if not even impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most seriously , the accus@@ ations from senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria areas would have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he fought this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and foremost , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after having been reli@@ eved for the last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ attered him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard , especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the national television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ Dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ankara ra@@ ged fur@@ i@@ ously against the West , as the response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power was regarded as weak response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is accompanied by persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , the Russian state of state won a bonus for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected bodies of state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this glit@@ tering palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; two countries that reject the West and feel bad and now al@@ lied themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks both pres@@ idents were told at the press conference , that they would not even have taken the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian battle jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the president of the Bank , the R@@ BS label is expected to be reduced to a back office role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for customers outside of Scotland , the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland , that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the Bank has been dis@@ soci@@ ated since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end users &quot; brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , it has decided to focus more on national brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised headquarters and the stock exchange to Nat@@ West will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are others , smaller brands for retail business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a guided tour of customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment brand , as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am now saying that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different , and our employees will work among these brands with the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we focus internally ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we would be a great bench for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3.@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market at Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling wine after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th profit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ ,000 British gain in New@@ market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which was trained by John G@@ os@@ den on his local race track with his second gain of the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reached the milestone in the flat race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori who previously won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here too &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it happened to New@@ market , because I ended up here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the jubil@@ ation , when he re@@ covers victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career stages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m , and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone only a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thri@@ lls fans for this sport for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already received 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and grand tournament jo@@ ckey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has rendered almost 30 years winner , which is great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was nerve @-@ wra@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ or@@ rich Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ whis@@ per and to return to his best form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier , that he wants to continue at competitions up to his age of at least 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Putin idi@@ fies staff of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly fired his head of staff , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the stric@@ test confidence group of Putin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it says that without giving reasons , Putin ordered the resignation of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was the deputy for Ivan@@ ovo since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is called ( in Russian ) , that he later became the Chief of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked Ivan@@ ov to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the most intimate friends of Vladimir Putin for a long time , and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced here - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody knows that at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the official statement - that a man who once tou@@ red as a potential president , once again led the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - tru@@ sting in tru@@ sting posts for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the Security Service K@@ GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , President of Russia could become president of Russia , as a third term Putin might have viol@@ ated the Constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president three and a half years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he killed producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical engagement at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced their termination in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ els@@ was ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the set , it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details about how Gib@@ son &apos;s character deri@@ ves from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart blood in the past twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planned broadcasting of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; en@@ ig@@ ma around fish , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with Sand@@ a@@ ale which were picked out by a fountain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle in Per@@ is@@ cope in hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of two inches long fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical cables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ boat cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witness@@ ing an engineering art from a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the deck deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete uss for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this fantastic project , the closure is a trend@@ setting high and low construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the northern tower in the expansion , we had to close the gap between the north or the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reached 700 milli@@ metres south by pulling the northern feeding bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a massive and at the same time very tricky business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massive as the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the tolerances upon which the team were working , they were tiny - on each side , they only amounted to a few millimeters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men are lucky to be alive , after they were thrown from fishing boats by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved on their own strength . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and put the worst before &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach , until we left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all came aboard the ship boat , and were brought back to the rescue station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the boat engine had an emergency stop , the boat was released from the person who controlled the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , someone has w@@ aking up over these men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
badly hurt - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg Har@@ burg with a knife , and seriously injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal stuff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she came into the apartment , he went to her twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 44 year old was injured in his hand , and injured on the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this prompted the sister of his sister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she could not move him to leave the apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old was pushing his sister to his side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who builds fine apartments from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green my : investors should be put much stronger into duty in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , how does one react to the bad news that in the coming years , Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting , the SPD propose a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; room for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in agreement with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the favorable apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big controversy in the town hall was , as viol@@ a : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as viol@@ a : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of fact , the CD@@ U wants to make a few rules as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the left still wants tough@@ er conditions for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of that , as viol@@ a , a tightening of the situation is on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the program is not entirely new : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how to compensate for the loss of further around 1300 inexpensive apartments , whose support will be expected in the next few years ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent this , the budget@@ ary spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bu@@ ys pending bonds from the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing homes back into the price binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the year , there are deadlines for the west city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1800 apartments , one could get there back into the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the West Bank is drastically increased again , the aim of the so @-@ called mixing is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few parts of the city , there should be no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , they have concentrated on more building places for family homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what does not mean , however , that a compromise can not be found yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teenagers and children don &apos;t go out to play anymore , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been compla@@ ined in the last decade of many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about catching people from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am of course referring to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased somewhat at the beginning of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand , which over@@ loaded the server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players take their smartphones out and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , they can be captured &quot; captured &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation that played the game when it was younger , joined the boat and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , who followed 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days following the market launch of the game , the number of people pursued by 30 minutes each day jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , it only sees the raw data for improving performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active on deaf ears because many public messages are dull and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you exercise regularly , you can reduce your chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual , there are also cre@@ am@@ ian play@@ sc@@ outs , which must always complain about something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when Smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will dimin@@ ish with time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games combining apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
all along the line brilliant .
and now finally Olympic champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast celebrated the battle title on Thursday , enlar@@ ging the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their total score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es will be playing on the Swedish Bar during the multi @-@ war campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics stadium of Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ battle title and in total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she broke into tears when her final result was shown , and her long journey in that moment found an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is this success in the same league like unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es has won the last three years , including 10 gold med@@ als , including 10 gold med@@ als , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced themselves after winning gold and silver in the solo multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics stadium of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ ly took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell celebrations of the co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Bil@@ ly insi@@ sted that during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina led light through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
floating beams and dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resum@@ ed with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the hanging beam - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor he was on top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her En@@ der@@ man - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ ly shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their practice , she threw the audience to K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Bil@@ es , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very different meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot dead in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks during a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Ro@@ cky Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis Dau@@ ghter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots out of a fire@@ arm gun , standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police told that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ raid , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led investig@@ ators to take a closer look at , whether it is associated with four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , seven people were killed in nine attacks and two others were injured in nine attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked , and were perpet@@ rated by the same mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a witness shared the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned on an empty pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge he@@ els and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most 6 @-@ year olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ quity Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I did not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t create it .
then I did not let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s wrong at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her , and that he might not even survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some doctors even went so far , that they proposed to institution@@ alise it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the aid of a walking aid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year , and he still cannot speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he slowly progres@@ ses .
he can run and cycle with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund has thought for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say , how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional value of an uncertain future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wondered constantly , what will happen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really say to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floods gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency stand on Friday , with more rainf@@ alls all Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards , governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards , told that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the communities concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ste@@ ele said , that the church of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had ordered ten thousand Sand@@ sacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather service indicated that in this area , additional 3 to 5 inches may fall in rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday as it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record level over the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood a lot of houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ re@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi river border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of the flood water in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rise steep@@ ly overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that a further step@@ son , who lives nearby , would have warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and streaming in , &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a high level of river in the 48 years in which she lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ans@@ ford said that all three rescu@@ ers were rescu@@ ed in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated to Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation of ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that , since Wednesday , the soil has been fully balanced by rainf@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and road floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , Par@@ ish and educ@@ ator in five school districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WW@@ L C@@ BS , a subsidiary of the C@@ BS , reported that there were 200 over@@ flooded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were both flooded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , which were flus@@ hed out of the flood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the flood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his data , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as flooded , but on Friday , no reports have been reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; blown out by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police reported that the 6 @-@ year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time that a 6 @-@ year old boy was shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ parents reported that Brown had suffered several shot injuries , including the leg , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was aware of his transport to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s state was classified as critical in a hospital , and he had to undergo several operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s family shared the station , that it is expected to recover again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he would have had the first class to start at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 29 year old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy was shot at the front seat of a car , together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who was in a critical condition , was shot , reported the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other two victims were not found in the car , and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there was apparently a cross @-@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various storm ri@@ fl@@ es , were paraly@@ sed by the crime scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems , that this was clearly a long struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road , on both sides of the road , there were leg@@ umes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given here several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; par@@ ked police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di to the police station in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently checking the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross driver , when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lan@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ covers , and the police are still looking for a suspect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why we need Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what I imagine at the Women &apos;s Olympics in Tur@@ ns , and that is more than a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic@@ in , round off , makes everybody proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this team is finally mirr@@ ored by the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the head of this sport , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female singers was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American female . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympic winner and America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champ@@ ionships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as expected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we experience the top of this sport , but this is how gymn@@ as@@ tics of the whole country do not look like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four tur@@ ners in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and can be maintained primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics which are maintained by parents , who are responsible for training , training , travel and accommodation ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of these sne@@ akers lay in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner gets its entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to offer the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls that are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ as@@ tics training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics foundation 20 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tur@@ nes develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health , as well as for school and professional success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thank you so many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistance doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians voted on at a vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans were revealed to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend packages to improve the maintenance of times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the BM@@ A spokesperson for assistance specialists , stated last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially that it will satisfy the current crisis of the staff and to treat all physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talking to the government on resistance , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was what Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done for the last month , that his door was always open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , raise awareness and address the concerns of the assistance specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he does not do this , the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further training measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , as nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were included in order to cover doctors on the strip of stri@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes , by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week of the week for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians , which are subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , asked the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor competition measures achieve nothing but burdens already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , pa@@ yers and their families to worry , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past two months , we talked to the minister of assistance specialists and responded positively to the concerns of guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the ministry of health and other mini@@ stries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employers hoped that the continued positive engagement to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , training col@@ leges , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the Ministry of Health on compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after the authorities have been advised to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or medication reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty materials in the ar@@ tery walls that form layers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the blood cl@@ ots triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ICE &apos;s introduc@@ tory statement , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people , who already had a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture allows electoral fraud in Muslim areas
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed from office last year , due to corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread suff@@ rage in Muslim communities is ignor@@ antly ignored , like a devastating government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les acc@@ uses the police , observers and Rath@@ geber to have ignored evidence of election abuse based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an ant@@ ag@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be allowed by the police to set shut @-@ off bands outside of elec@@ tive cabinets to protect voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a vot@@ er has to name his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report proposes not to apply removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , when they release their vote to prevent someone to vote twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demands that the press should have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions of un@@ official agencies or work@@ groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government against the wider corruption and fraud culture that comes with it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election sc@@ and@@ als , in the east of London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a special court decided that the current mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have put his critics in silence with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation , in which a person was chosen as someone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that in the whole country there would be evidence for fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , he expressed an alar@@ ming influence on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter selection - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including driving badges to prove their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; it is appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the older , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Bris@@ ban@@ al background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been doubts that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists handle letter selection documents in order to stop &quot; re@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and welfare purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she left her voice , to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic athlete is by far not the only one to have gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one may believe the social media faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US squ@@ ad in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gänger on the race track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team member of the US squ@@ ad in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street star quite similar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher received ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any big simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ le@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina , with its big , expressive eyes , is to be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption act@@ ress
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another con@@ ten@@ tious comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian silver medal Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord while the American Nathan Adrian has att@@ ested to fans of an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the US football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m fre@@ est@@ yle squ@@ ad@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too excited , he went like M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; audiences across Canada were quickly re@@ acting online , after they were shocked by the sound and speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did the C@@ BC commentary just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old woman from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many were talking to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard , how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show , commented live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast on a floating performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , we are sorry that it has happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users , compla@@ ining about the Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed too quickly , and gave a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our fo@@ als in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments referring to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate choice . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald exc@@ used in the shipment and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ties over woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled out and laid her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pri@@ mark Business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried to try the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she returned and the business left without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out their own gar@@ ter trousers and trousers and tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she liked nothing to go back and out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to interfere with anyone watching - or thinking about the person who would under certain circumstances buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how contradictory to think that someone would take shelter with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of sale after they went - what &apos;s just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your predat@@ or around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as first so you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder , before hitting it with your free el@@ bow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strike him down with his knee and twist the weapon out of his hands , while the att@@ acker attacks his face and move backwards while attacking the weapon on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot , grab the weapon and twist it , so the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the att@@ acker against the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and strai@@ ghten the weapon on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is doing Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is most secure to over@@ take your money if you are not a Kra@@ v Grand@@ master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t his tongue for a guide to his tongue at the most fil@@ thy places in Europe
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British travel@@ er under@@ took a serious test of the immune system , and stran@@ gled some of the most dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ used his course on a Euro ticket , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before leaving any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and show us what he is going to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thought to wipe out the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pulling toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , nothing left behind it , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world , eating peculiar as well as wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from public funds to stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task definitely posed his immune system under a sample &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he was justified in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sample coat showed a lumin@@ ometer value of more than 4,000 units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer speed is less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after their l@@ umin@@ ometer numbers were over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands one of less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; that shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not lick it here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which ended that we said &quot; L@@ ass uns Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who was directing the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had checked some of the things that I had instructed him to lick it , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there were things with which it was easier to get Ian to get them dancing and others in which this was quite difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all lac@@ tic acid bacteria associate with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they have at least use products that included lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ soci@@ a family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ ist social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked cl@@ er@@ ks of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the walls had holes , wooden boards were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family has been res@@ ett@@ led , and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family is not@@ orious , and its reputation is also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said that the terror that the family had joined , forced street fights with bas@@ eb@@ u@@ alties , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive cries , disputes and floods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood boards were torn up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neighbours said they had to fight them on the street , and had to call on the police regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing met her and her partner forci@@ bly by the property after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung was che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbors , who said that their lives were made to hell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were afraid of no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lived 20 years beside them , and it was always bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stood up , because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have agreed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see would accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family as a dele@@ tion is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have bol@@ dly approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours , and the message conveyed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ sting on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers of the house administration will have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains , which surround the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ don received a fine , after having found herself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life in 2013 in a car accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having been homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police says that they will del@@ o@@ fold ten@@ ant , who do not stick to the house rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with the fact that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ lio is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists in Portugal shifted to panic after a flying military jet beach over@@ flow@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the air forces imposed an unbelievable storm flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was present &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtened tourists start pan@@ i@@ cking , after a very low jet crashed on a full beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatic video shots show how the military plane nearly flew in close proximity to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro , north of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ists jump@@ ed up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzle engines , without seeing first what was coming to them through the clouds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers , posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would drop me down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were put in panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast and to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker said that the jet was flying slightly deeper than usual due to bad visibility , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security was at no time at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with which also four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the circumstances - strong fog and smoke , which limits its visibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot fishing boats had to be identified as part of the exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sevilla
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup opposing the FC Sevilla , the return game increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ th@@ inner must abst@@ ain from N@@ ey@@ mar , the subordin@@ ate Cup@@ mor@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europe League champion , competing in the Olympic Football Tournam@@ ent with Brazil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s request was clari@@ fied at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo for the time being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been ranked number one for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coach Luis En@@ rique , up to now , gave up a clear decision and gave Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining Candi@@ dates commen@@ ced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness state of the team who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . did not really convince . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sev@@ ille again has the 2 : 3 defeat following extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with so far , Barcelona has eleven successes of record winner in this race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma Long in a league of table tennis , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the World Ranking First ranked the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two Chinese made it as expected , and made the title among themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the Five Emp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire , Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sentences and time @-@ outs , they didn &apos;t have any coaches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they dragged on the tri@@ bun@@ e , and left their cont@@ ests in a fair competition on their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches up to here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang was brief@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expectedly un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma , not the expected em@@ itting match developed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , nevertheless enough breath @-@ taking ball changes were to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russians had a ri@@ pple injury after that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , have been in similar high table tennis tables Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Gi@@ ves ″ huge Problems ″ in the Elec@@ toral Camp@@ a@@ ign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative national states to lose their majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his election campaign in the former repub@@ lican strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rare moment , in which usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ lican camp out of the race , doubts about his success are now growing in the fight for the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida and Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media ti@@ dings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repub@@ lican strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were equal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ator CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for political correctness , that was OK , Tr@@ ump said further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened to withdraw funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not present a better survey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will intervene more strongly for Congress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympics : tri@@ ster fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the second dop@@ ing affair , K@@ eni@@ as athletes are threatened to play in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a fraud trial in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to investigate the case , the International Olympic Committee immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , passed a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reported by the team management of Ken@@ y@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IA@@ AF World Association provided the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to establish its own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , sent the sample and signed it , &quot; said Ken@@ yan chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the accreditation of the athletes who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become World Cup @-@ Fourth in Beijing in 2015 , over 800 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich had been withdrawn from the Rio games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested at the Nairobi airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Kenya , after many years of dop@@ ing , Kenya has been under special observation for some time now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks in front of the Rio games , it was unusual that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , WA@@ DA visited Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reports the ARD has repeatedly been repro@@ ached , that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there will be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently demanded a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had addressed them in the field of Russian athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it has been proven that this type of sport has been systematically adapted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes have been excluded from the summer games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the classical temple and fulfilled a youth room with the role of Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their melody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would say , that we really have Bern@@ ad@@ ein &apos;s music in our blood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members her love with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dancing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as Roman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his gaze , it is his life ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we both have a southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and a joyful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we went to New York , and the inhabitants of New York did not want them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the same topics , and they are as expressive today as they were then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; London school@@ girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girl who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e lawyer said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had anticipated to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with making the decision to ever make this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London embark@@ ed on a plane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tana &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and became a widow within a few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton is going to stay as a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of an election victory in Gar@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation by Barack Obama in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority leader in Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell , Senate , believes that the next President will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference , that he expects Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said he hadn &apos;t spoken to Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the U.S. App@@ ell@@ ation Court , for the District of Columbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and helpers of the repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also noted , Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to release a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine differenti@@ ates from ol@@ d@@ school play@@ boys , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do that for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , he believes that the calendar also does . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity , where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the release of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women will want to participate in this project , because it is a beautiful work of art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models can submit their images online or in person , in an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkey : Kurdish congregation anticip@@ ates mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not adapt to Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the office of the Gü@@ len @-@ proximity Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of protective seekers from Turkey to flee to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , there could be even &quot; some hundred thousand people , &quot; he believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the harsh passing of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium @-@ term with some hundred thousand protected seekers from Turkey in Germany , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already passed Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal sanctions against months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were on the run within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the failed coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe , if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that calls for refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the Association compla@@ ined to the deliberate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national government called for the Federal Government to position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critic is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , I feel no longer confident in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destroys teachers and other acade@@ mics , the professional existence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not adapt and Erdo@@ gan runs , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as reported by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already announced the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany because of political persecution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people , and thus nearly 29 per cent of all accepted as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , non @-@ war , poverty or lack of perspective cannot be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum seekers after the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from government side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer election campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because stupid as hitherto it is not : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the bal@@ lot milit@@ ants , are on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so you should not choose the holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , helpers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate air ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and count towards the end , are just lab@@ orious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again to pass an election campaign shortly before the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , just started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off , and what remains at the end of the remains of the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , as it did his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , sailors have got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the flowering of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; We create this &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place for election at the wrong time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel twice to large @-@ scale demonstrations , Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis is in the North East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Sachsen , as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U disp@@ enses with the usual election campaign pitches on market places and in front shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and air ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , so co@@ king , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noticed that in the country it is un@@ le@@ ashed that it must be very strict again to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly existing in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the council of the CD@@ U elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; they must go where it hurt , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD a particularly committed election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats recently stood at 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they make a modern virtue out of the holidays , and largely reloc@@ ate their election campaign to the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls it the President of Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green elec@@ tive fighters go on search for local vocal ch@@ ests among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ 27 rehabilitation : guest houses suffer under lock@@ out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is always praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made it quite sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ visor .
there is no default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relief of those responsible for the construction works is also praised , for example when it comes to the establishment of hab@@ il@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the block of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again suspended , the traffic situation within the village is relaxed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen , the citizens can now travel from the B 27 on both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic by the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Head of the Chief Executive Officer Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many bills were searching and more familiar with their navigation system than the sign@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what led to this , that some trucks were fran@@ tic in residential areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the speed limits were not observed , the congregation ampli@@ fied the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself well on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , two to three per minute have been flas@@ hed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fastest was on the way , with 77 hour kilometers in the pace @-@ 30 zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become more calm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the street is open again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
business@@ men do not like to look into the cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that the B 27 rehabilitation has resulted in sales break@@ downs , everyone that you ask can look through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also gives a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most heavily traffi@@ cked are the bars , along the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue grew by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the renovation of the street has declined by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his associates have to be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt responding to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant benefit otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other districts , where something more spacious has been handled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that other regul@@ ars are now less frequent due to complicated traffic management , can understand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot drive , it is also nice elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the completion of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the effect of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the greatest crisis experienced by its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six months of construction work , which is brutal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly bol@@ ted to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère lays down a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what has a loss status with terror to do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ser@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically unacceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of the Interior , however , he was directed at results and at a &quot; real@@ is@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they are all the more extensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have already announced , announced , announced , announced that a new security agency is supposed to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals involving the SPD so far : he wants to impose sympath@@ isers for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts on the German passport with double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of this , he still believes this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , Mai@@ zi@@ ère will present some new ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in part , they have in part : he plans quick proceedings for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to incar@@ cer@@ ate people before expul@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for distra@@ ctions for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - about those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some things are still un@@ balanced , and leaves questions open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ ties , for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it can &apos;t be said that the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that are pro@@ found@@ ly employed by people , could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in election battle times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inner safety is extremely focused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD therefore become increasingly in position on the issue of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , between the two parties it was high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ cal argument about the equi@@ pping of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , where the department leaders also demand a ban on bur@@ ka and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also here , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is lab@@ orious for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a return from the double pass , he stays nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ended the discussion in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make you new , don &apos;t make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it that could take care of fights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the SPD , too , is trying to benefit itself with the issue of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes a cau@@ tious conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting g@@ lim@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite diesel engines , delivery numbers are rising worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not run around in all markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recall action , there is confusion around a concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen does not start deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite its many brands and a number of well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer continues to offer a plus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in July , the VW Core brand slow@@ ed mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the overall sales , as the company noted in D@@ ax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries fell by almost one sixth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann returned the weaker figures from July , particularly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there was a reluc@@ tance to buy business in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was also bur@@ dened by the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , where the gas supply is first escal@@ ated , a minus is also found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony will continue to benefit from the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an output minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from January to July , Group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to advance a sales figure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software emission test .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting to the workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after upgrading the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car park provides customers with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be legal entities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee for re@@ inde@@ er diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was confirmed last Monday , VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fully meet the requirements of my enquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that no wor@@ sen@@ ing of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting does not take place and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was stated in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest of customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal in respect of possible warranty regulations as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore VW do not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for sufficient savings in future , as a second institute in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordinary savings would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deposit banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fee applies to Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 Euros on checking or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 costs will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time , he has kept 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not exploit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t go for every million Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs are now continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to leave the cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CF@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the customers would have an understanding and change to different types of investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU co @-@ operative federation explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible to carry you alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with pun@@ ishments for deposits from three million Euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their sk@@ ate bank branch made head@@ lines in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Head of the Banking Association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele that is endowed with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if they keep money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded in 1911 , the co @-@ operative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known who calculate a replacement for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of June , the President of the German Federal Association of German B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , said : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition was tough , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers in Germany won &apos;t like this in width , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
destination Pl@@ ates : who bu@@ ys vinyl records actually ?
lonely men mean middle @-@ aged plates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before going to the comment section , to over@@ see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ aven@@ ue men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not based on a boom in millenni@@ als who want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have recently purchased a record , are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age of 45 and 54 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely pair of buyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also no hor@@ des by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers reserve their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog was a news report on television , I would follow the camera while standing in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o stands slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , which I follow by Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot via email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when she appeared and bought items he sold when he was young and rough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and set themselves to buy their old records again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people usually dischar@@ ged around 1998 or 1999 to their collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would explain the boom to supporters of the record review of a certain age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record businesses offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took an impulse to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , evo@@ ke happy youth memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a simple way to mentally employ yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pol@@ l of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet heard them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , whereas 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned as I b@@ atten out a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ board so I can put them into the shelf . &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more produc@@ t@@ las@@ civi@@ ous and less musi@@ cally speaking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are younger people , not older ones who only come into their homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a colourful audience when I go to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are couples about 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ t@@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz we@@ eps from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of them looks very lonely , but next psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to determine if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around business for some minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it makes a window mannequ@@ in rather than buying a window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while I give the appearance to mu@@ sty jeans in jeans , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are looking for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cro@@ at record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of boards of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , essential records for an average collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far from that it is impossible to touch them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths sole for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they let themselves be ignored , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not spend their Thursday morning with security through plat@@ es@@ ies of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they avoid the stub@@ born look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who rises over the shoulders of not gri@@ pping men of middle @-@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

French court sets off offer on demo@@ lition of deals in the jungle of refugee camps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a court hearing this week , the authorities argue in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary stores in which people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to final drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for a couple of euros in temporary restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which carry a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important , as free meals , which are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they made sure that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the places threatened by the erosion was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp that is shared and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum seekers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; for those children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants were estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers in the course of summer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly say it is difficult to comment the timing of yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must analyze in peace , what reasons had led to de@@ bac@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases start @-@ up for live video players
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watching other people playing video games is huge , and Microsoft wants to benefit from it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , speci@@ alizing in this hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Microsoft announced how much money flows for the acquisition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can watch others while playing , but also intervene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , they can give up the players missions and face enemies and provide equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard will launch a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of electric sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way to the global media event , Facebook should help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advertising industry is already listening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff of the start @-@ up , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the US state of Washington , moved to Microsoft headquarters in California Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , nothing will change for the customer through the acquisition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the Video Player department around the X@@ box console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market of live streaming of video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are t@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ witch was purchased by online retailer Amazon in 2014 , for almost one billion dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s shave must be adjusted to the next generation speed monitor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used on accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , on highway construction sites or refurb@@ ishing bridges with temporary temporary pol@@ arity there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure speed limits with a stationary heater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days in case of un@@ interrupted measurement operations , and the case data are transmitted via a modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans after time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved with trailer coupling according to the manufacturer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that it is not simply cl@@ amped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear in a bul@@ let @-@ proof outer shell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2015 , the trailer is being tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hed with the new technology : France recently ordered 100 units , following an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Britain picks up silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is on Thursday evening when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side step@@ ping , back , line running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the Silver Med@@ al - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back in the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have put a 15 @-@ man team in top form in this form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years ago , she lost every game in the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they just lost one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji began wonderful , and shot G@@ Bs of fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it felt like captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving bus@@ ses . the World Series W@@ inners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ze in the corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with another four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he converted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a deputy T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the seventh minute , j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua was in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart , and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ tics of the GB team , and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still un@@ learned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ j@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed to Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play by Fi@@ ji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long for the south se@@ ein@@ ians whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ki@@ cked off in the lawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , Fi@@ ji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot @-@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer for a rowing victory
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games , and that will mean something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first strokes to the last , 220 tough p@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra importance in their golden moment on the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if only the two were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ protected use , which is also exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind each gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild helpers who make up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who would not survive 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , he ris@@ eth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had bladder cancer , which is operated and that did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , off the season , which kept the break to a minimum , if that was the right concept in such circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but this makes it one even greater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ stri@@ ped morning to talk something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t have desired a better person for training , or a better trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race during the last five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the last 500 meters when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in the process , remain in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really important , not to let itself be carried away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not out to make something big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year , the couple will take a break before making decisions about his future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary care taken for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , is reti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association is known as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ly . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time ago , it was the name of the Bavarian Radio Broad@@ casting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia viol@@ ated the compulsory association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ess as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who was 31 years old in the compulsory association , 28 years as managing director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , at the age of 65 , he was retired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , annually encourages about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member municipalities are the municipalities Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for other towns and municipalities there are water supply contracts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brun@@ n Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller has been hired as a water@@ man in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Tourist Board in 1988 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency calls on weekends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as outstanding events , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1998 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) , the renovation of the high reservoir ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) , and the new generation of water pipes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always received new additions , because water is the most important food for drinking water and drinking water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised the faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he settled the water @-@ appropriate association , as if it were his own company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate sin@@ king before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for that , he received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was fi@@ anc@@ ée Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is the best water@@ man , and he was a faithful boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a highlight in his view , he described the construction of well and the restructuring of the expe@@ dien@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult application , however , was the pipe bur@@ gl@@ ary at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ der on a third of January . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , at minus 17 degrees , the whole night was to work , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the supply of new brun@@ n can only be maintained , because the high can@@ ister is filled with hoses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer by Lau@@ ter , who follows the successor of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sickness had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has progres@@ sed well and now I am learning privately in New York , where it is the best therap@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that lies back two years when I sang to the Milan Scala , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .

relationship at Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ m@@ n ) on his partner and injured her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself inv@@ oked and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him I was publicly punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile nationwide , as Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the police published a photo of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the man has a bald head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you see Sven S. , the 110 will call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the responsible police in Lü@@ beck , initially , did not want to provide information on the ground or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a light of killing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we don &apos;t say at this moment , &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special service command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
steel - flash@@ light for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
the Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( SPD ) said : &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years we could finally achieve tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the European Commission initially planned to ask steel producers supplying gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry also threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , there is now a consultation with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when generators are replaced in the steel units , an EEG change of 20 percent falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , too , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for self @-@ electricity production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry has a particular significance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regards to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emission rights law , climate and employment goals are to be weighed down , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate the world &apos;s largest producer of producers in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand of mass steel on the world market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European producers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies pricing dump@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has become somewhat relaxed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel have impact , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have bri@@ ghtened up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not clear , however , how sustainable the price recovery is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp has remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 3,@@ 4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Economy Association announced on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short increase in May , the quantities produced went back to the second month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community , spirit , health : sen@@ sing sen@@ iors good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the singing accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp as her whole life : as a young girl she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotional and physical &quot; she describes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and alive , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , they do something good with their health and mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler goes from the German senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because often social and family structures are often released , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in doing so , sen@@ iors exercise deep and controlled respir@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever ur@@ ges his lungs regularly , does not get out of the box as quickly as possible in everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of the Sen@@ iors @-@ Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of her youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people even dev@@ ote themselves to long @-@ lying events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s own voice and listening to a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just older people who live alone are doing so , not just focusing on themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler points out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem is also growing by singing in the choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show yourself : if I practise for a long time , I will be better and watch over me - this experience strengthens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , good reasons to start singing are enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to try a new hobby , do not hesitate , even if he thinks of having little talent , says L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 people singing , who hears when a tone comes next to it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for a suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a retirement home , one can simply join . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , you can directly turn to the church or church leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many senior choirs are also found via the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet , can ask friends or neighbours to help with the internet research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing a choir , you should necessarily join a choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a han@@ go@@ ver at the cries of the young
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover , what effect the sleep of cat babies has on adult animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to her surprise , the male also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved like the females . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
female cats can recognize the patho@@ gen degree of cat babies at the cla@@ ws of the little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they react by ten percent faster to l@@ utes of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary School and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) have found out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , but always the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ch@@ ewing of less and strongly excited young ones for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said von der M@@ H@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cries differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three minutes , they were taken out of the throwing box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , who were raised in addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the low sample sample , the researchers maintain their results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , responded differently to the cries , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they swi@@ vel@@ ed faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this ability may possibly be worshipped , or evol@@ ves with the sexually mature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski picks up with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ chi@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey has again played an important football game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the fall test in July , the government refused to interfere with everyday life of normal citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len that is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , football is not stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the former heavy i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sü@@ ley@@ r is to be a suppor@@ ter of the minister Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; true , the state of emergency promised for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact most Turks have no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy guard &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sport is - like the whole country , split into supporters and opponents of the Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ ossi@@ tas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , what unites the Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the fans agree , whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ po@@ tas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &apos;s &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially time to arrive to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cologne in the past season demonstrated its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as the top sc@@ orer of his club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finished the season in an excellent way , and his team secured the tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; split off early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south of Li@@ g , it only reached rank six . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done that and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig laid the basis for the 14th title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also the reason for the fans to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the occasion of the political situation in the country , it was not possible to return to Croatia under the contract and not to return to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , because of the political situation in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he quoted the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to do this , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his estimated 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als , at Olympia in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin has been closed twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other out@@ performed Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh , they fight in Rio for med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of dop@@ ing is , as before , the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian swimming driver Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who was acc@@ using her start right shortly before the games , was whi@@ st@@ led out and posted at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a qu@@ ir@@ ky scenario : with an open smile she was still in the hall , and had provoked her appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a celeb@@ r@@ ity that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a jubil@@ ation tower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenge for U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after surgery , she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra P@@ erk@@ ovic : 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Champion in 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 has been positively tested on the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ erk@@ ovic denied the intelligence , and was blocked for six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows , this year , go to the account of the big gold favor@@ i@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ride ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positively in 2010 and locked 21 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , regre@@ t@@ t@@ ted merchan@@ dis@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ reproach , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had so many med@@ als subsequently recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing was detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro title 2006 because of testosterone deficiency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also back , due to a certificate issued by the International Court of Sports CA@@ S . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m , he is ranked second in the world ranking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was first tested in May , but must nevertheless start in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 29 year old world champion , references to taking a banned dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell off and ran off on July 13th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she planned her home journey at the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether from further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he is also still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , a Thai Thai was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , a further human being was killed according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , a bomb explosion was reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed before the territory of the coast police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g were demanding several injured in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning from journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives , but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist insurrection or with international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they assume that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta have been laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities would have received intelligence advice on upcoming stops in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still unclear , which group is behind the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police instructed their officials all over the country to reinforce security around important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace which was used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry strongly recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , no necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( Security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution created by the military j@@ un@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives the military a great influence over the years to come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to launch chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , keeps himself in good position to have the kingdom return to stability and order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the south of the country for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly one year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is advised by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several offices , the constitutional obj@@ ectors have also set up the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; evidence of the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we observe the movement too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; identical movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; an un@@ controlled mass immigration and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ aten said , his authority was closely coordinated with the offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to address them with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a real advertisement for your own cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the propaganda is supposed to attract people emotion@@ ally , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , from several federal states , reports on contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians had been given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , he has no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant to a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , will change its direction and become so extreme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive factor , therefore , is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the significant increase in ri@@ ot@@ aged crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camp , Ma@@ aten said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years , we have found that there can be legal @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that further ri@@ gh@@ tist groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against asylum seekers or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups were created on the regional level , or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate worried about many attacks on the account of people , who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the suspect in the case of asylum seekers had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes previously in@@ different with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have voted politically in@@ different or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , who , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by right wing extrem@@ ist mo@@ ods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always , the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old termin@@ ates his pre@@ run with a gap of 48 seconds and ranked the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it was rather his not just sporty figure , attracting the attention of the international media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympics ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the international swimming pool , the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start @-@ up right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is distributed to make swimming more popular in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since in Ethiopia most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly , the first nick@@ names made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some media reported it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of whale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny about him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters open @-@ style , didn &apos;t play any role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; memorable was the appearance of the swimming driver from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to go on alone in a run over 100 meters of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old met only eight months before Olympia , and had never completed such a long distance before the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop on the new square has been stolen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der left their business on Monday at 17.@@ 30 and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she came back at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock the next morning , around 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .

Tr@@ ump does not look so close to the threatening electoral defeat
the Repub@@ lican Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks to a campaign event in Florida .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already got an alternative video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV transmitter CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for political correctness , that was ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he den@@ ounced the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mail rises to trade with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soon , the Group wants to start trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of next year , the post will also be able to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter into third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has been testing for months whether to sell their own stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , to sell also to other farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; post @-@ Chairman Jürgen Ger@@ den had said that there is always questioning , for example by craftsmen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group plans to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ da announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and to ensure a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can imagine , that we will change the complete fleet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ K leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the returns suddenly came , but not quite surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K concluded that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the forefront of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after once more dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company management stands the global number five in the industry in front of a new beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the year , G@@ RP Executive Board wants to leave the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already dischar@@ ges the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of 1 September , the management board of the Executive Board will take up the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ß@@ inger , distributing the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann has been found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for details , a company spokes@@ man did not want to name a company on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , anyone who will lead the market research company is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , the shareholders had a great deal of disappointment on the continued success of the re@@ organization initiated several years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are still not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder becomes un@@ steady at some point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would make the qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.@@ 1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the first half of the year , sales fell by 3.4 percent with 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter imp@@ acted mainly due to its difficult economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Consumer Experience business segment , EUR 139 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had a net income of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accidents - bus sli@@ ps into dit@@ ch in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ ho@@ fen ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the passengers suffered serious injuries , the police reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to legend , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their data to an opposing truck , partly on the counter@@ road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bus arrived right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six rescue cars and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ injured travelers were brought back by a regular bus to the Kr@@ umm@@ ho@@ fen district of P@@ ew@@ sum , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators called for the load experience , and possible witnesses to report to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fees per cubic metre of waste water will amount to 2.@@ 10 Euro as of 1 October 2016 for the area of the new village / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase once more at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a dispro@@ portion@@ ate calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the budget was approved by the District Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach that under@@ cover these waste water installations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ effective manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sh ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to intervene deeper into the pur@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented to the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , excess or under@@ cover from the preceding calculation period can also be compensated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt founded the grave increases in fees in all three wastewater facilities with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in the underlying calculation period in all three plants , not least due to their age , renovation and repair expenses have fallen to a considerable extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Az@@ endorf waste water plant due to a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first small pond had to be disposed of , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued care and maintenance costs which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water waste in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully beaten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the waste water facilities has remained spar@@ ed over the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the opinion of stone houses , as one cannot expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wastewater utility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure time and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prices fell by clothing and footwear ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furnishings , household appliances , and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prices remained as in the pre@@ mon@@ day at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
snapshot &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian carto@@ onist critic@@ ised
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snapshot says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure , which could be a painting of a Roy Licht@@ enstein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filters are bloo@@ ded , self @-@ rotating tools , generating more than 30 million sel@@ fies sel@@ fies per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all mis@@ steps will be drawn to the public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in which they were accused of promoting the application of black face or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and puff@@ ed che@@ eks , some critics named it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem , that the company has diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to pay tribute to anim@@ e characters , not as carto@@ ons of Asi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced r@@ attle , reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others declined the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , wrote in an e @-@ mail that the filter was widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and gentle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian cartoon and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face is pulled into the cutting extreme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are in terms of race di@@ vers@@ er than their older opponents - could rather expect to expect sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to stay un@@ noticed than before . &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a set @-@ up for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the majority of white , just male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as a private enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel manager who focused on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu on the other hand said that she will let her Snap@@ chat account be closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IS@@ IS Military Intelligence Information Information , re@@ jects Congress of Con@@ gresses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary report , created by a Repub@@ lican Club Task Force , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re @-@ serving information presented by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly drew a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; commented a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com are reaching up to the top point of the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 , in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government sp@@ ik@@ es have given instructions to modify the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their legislation to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements from the congress were clearly more positive than it meets the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under control of the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , repub@@ lican con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them , that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigation continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the repub@@ lican task force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com generated a moder@@ ately limited trial for IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave too little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts , with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday , by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last August , the New York Times reviews the Pentagon &apos;s chief inspec@@ tor , who were taken up after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense wouldn &apos;t comment on the congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have responded to the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of tens of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , fores@@ aw a small occupying force in Iraq against the recommendations of many analysts to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker ad@@ mits that there were no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State because these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this knowledge , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , comra@@ de Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with UK is standing before &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not one of the people , who keep their gates in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place that remains unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place in their group of six teams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first placed will take a little longer from the path , which will lead the other group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the game on Saturday , Americans have spark@@ ed a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time she had a ho@@ ckey s@@ layer in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team , began to turn things to a better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not have the work bench in London , which we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have been able to pull the helm completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; India was without victory in the tournament , but the team looked surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and lu@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wherever you are , how late it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events are steady and inevitable , a rapid relay race between competition and pursuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to become a tri@@ athlete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock of h@@ exag@@ onal dimples , would certainly have been under these known names , which would be sent to Prime Time , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic Tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further from the centre , some sports which are not generally accepted : arch@@ ery shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always have the breast swimming , and may it rule for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if I would like to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although jumping on a trampoline for 2000 when it was in Sydney , the last 16 years had noticed that many people I had asked were not aware of the fact that it was an Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had a athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese , and Canadi@@ ans for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping on a trampoline has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the kar@@ mic trem@@ bling of his never ending impact , but also the grace of the gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much like &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rising winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ ashing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are evaluated according to the performance , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two and thirty athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold go further , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and back , up and down on the playground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also another high goal in television transmission : the world or the Olympic record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s also what I feel , even when watching these games as something ti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or she turns off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s as Zen , as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the en@@ dr@@ es as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14,@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amid the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objec@@ ti@@ zing of male athletes - as the male American gymn@@ asts recently hit the Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his new fan community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia launched the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in shooting .
is Ethiopia going to collapse in the process ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed some un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in circulation , videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or early this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the UN Human Rights Commission is now calling for a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa , and its stability is cher@@ ished by the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians in order to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much western help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , and dissi@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or pushed into the wilderness of the desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation protests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold , in terms of power of governing coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this fierce , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den who were more or less forced in recent years could exploit the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness , after years of death under the surface , now explo@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they gathered to protests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as , the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ per@@ as , who mainly come from Eastern Europe , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that too is changing just too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the Am@@ per@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Am@@ res@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , has been prime minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012 for 17 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was considered tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts say that he was particularly tempted to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and use special commission@@ ers to manipul@@ ate enemies , and to make them harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ transparent reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a rebellion in 2005 , when thousands were prot@@ esting against elections , which were apparently fed by the government according to the data of analysts and were then stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the ensu@@ ing Raz@@ ors many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and that period of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government &apos;s internal mis@@ understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it accepts a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ sian town , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies to a peculiar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia to base its flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently reported that it had closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his associates to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains Obama &apos;s alle@@ gation that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissip@@ ate the last controversy on Friday that en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claims that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communications capabilities of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether to be able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings its comrades who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful period of time , in the peculiar position that he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump rested his statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t asked Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement slightly , he remembered that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last storm of criticism jump@@ ed down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to focus his campaign on falling demand values to the economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , he critic@@ ised himself when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the language boundaries in politics , and then return to demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more caus@@ al tone since his survey values have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent interc@@ essors of Tr@@ ump@@ et , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true in this sense that prior to Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back @-@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that Clinton &apos;s government , in Mrs. Clinton , served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by attacking the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and pre@@ occupied with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ aned the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof , that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once pushed over the market price , cafe comes back in Green@@ point &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a not@@ ari@@ al café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years served good coffee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of the Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soap , bought in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
native people registered it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , except the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if New York is change , then it is also new invention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing associate of the old café , the owner and manager of the new coffee shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a client offered him to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els , bought the same espresso machine model . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it even uses the same bulbs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and aci@@ dic onions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are natural cere@@ al bowls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and visited the club regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the club had closed , she had been drinking coffee for a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realised that it was the coffee and the culture in the club that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they set a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal was another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he went there before the work , and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still receiving his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not mean res@@ ent@@ ment , that the soap business took the old business space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee in the coffee shop as an ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a nearby building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt stated that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a gour@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s water@@ front soup soup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Good@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Hei@@ ghts and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner a small and schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District that has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pu@@ ree and vegetable mixture ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the re@@ porter ordered chopped wood , this found the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food products were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ in @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , tense theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed Co@@ e why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new budget was just as cl@@ amped : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food rem@@ nants , as coo@@ ks could hide fla@@ vor@@ ful ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unique bl@@ ends were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication would take preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their research for the book that includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as never before or ever , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists , among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - took care of the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budget@@ ary centers &quot; and the challenge to turn P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly tasty are the reports about the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ cake @-@ meal @-@ attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the million @-@ million man of the world to which he became . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room , carrying a tu@@ x@@ edo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was wonderfully realistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an ex@@ post@@ mark with his stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mr@@ s Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , has been dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country reg@@ ained its legs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law , for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of waste food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the plates were cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e made a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , and added that it was a bad trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no beaten cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each di@@ pped slightly reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly , it tasted not bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E won three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed in bombing attack , he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has even died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a group of civilians who , according to the image newspaper , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game , to draw people out of bom@@ bed homes and to help in the war zone first aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian guard , which shows him during an 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he talked about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs over the E@@ yel@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that not children can play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deadly bomb of Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following an investigation on board ship S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic , until today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Greenland sh@@ arks receive only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 yards away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span that means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected long that Greenland &apos;s hair become stone @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the evidence was lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greenland sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter on the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers know little about the li@@ on@@ land@@ ha@@ ie lifestyle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their time @-@ bends pace them , when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream , looking for cad@@ a@@ vers from higher water layers down to the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sh@@ arks who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine the age of animals , they analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remarkable lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons seek greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the thir@@ teen animal length with 220 centimet@@ res length , the lens nucle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its l@@ enti@@ cian , all major Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k could be 3@@ 92 years old even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the researchers were able to assign an age to the length . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined 156 years ago , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the increase obviously allows for at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should also be world record for verteb@@ rates currently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , caught a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip on the neck , was caught in Alaska . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame of as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , they mature later - and age more slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal feeds heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the heat loss of one gram of mouse is much larger than with a gram of elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a very large animal should rather invest his resources into a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
building site in a double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent session , the Municipal Council has focused on issues relating to construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the newly proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sale of plots in residential construction areas &quot; Road @-@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in rural and quiet residential community , Schön@@ au , will appeal to young families and other sen@@ iors alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said , Bau@@ will@@ s can immediately report in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els in its September meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the establishment of additional business enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to am@@ end the land use plan in part @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already proven there will be expanded by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough for them to have approval in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is responsible for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk management ES@@ R@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luxembourg is a big fund industry , but it does not cut off as well as Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the town has easily available commercial properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not as easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than on the River Main . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands on seventh place , Luxembourg to No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power relations also speak for this : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 6@@ 2500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gilead receives legal fees from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a U.S. arbitr@@ ator decided that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbur@@ se the legal costs , which were created from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Gilead was released from a compensation fee of $ 200 million for the infringement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was covered in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead claimed the cost incurred during the defense of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which is the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case dates back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took care of each other and took possession of laboratory work involving sof@@ ab@@ i@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the US , troops backed that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US supported the complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have dug in the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria are currently har@@ ming the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared with the D@@ KS Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying out cleaning work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 on Friday , this resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated $ 5.3 million to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax statements for the last ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Kaiser continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false pron@@ ounc@@ ements and re@@ draws in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the release of the Pres@@ idency of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections are not finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he@@ aps critics , among others the Repub@@ lican Pres@@ idential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already heard that his refusal raises questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business angels and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton already over@@ threw himself on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which High @-@ ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump sum@@ mon@@ ed to publish his tax return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , she spoke to Mich@@ ig@@ an &apos;s economy during a speech on the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the past decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor &apos;s War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who pay more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buff@@ ets said he was also subjected to an I@@ RS tax check , and Tr@@ ump has &quot; fear &quot; in front of voters and not from tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return back to 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Clin@@ tons who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that these only USD 100 were related to their income than the majority of Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ds and fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , filled with chill@@ i powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method has proven to be effective , and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years , collabor@@ ated with U.S. conservation , to use volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friday is a global phone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities without damaging the eleph@@ ants without causing the elephant to do so , &quot; said the CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ ron Dam@@ ian Bell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two steps include the light of the elephant , with a torch and the bubbles in a horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; chip cloud &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts up with a knob and spray fine dust to chill@@ i powder into the air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a rule , a touch is usually enough to chase the elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a last possibility represents a shi@@ py@@ ard , which shoots a fire@@ work fire@@ works into the air and causes a loud , light explosion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no new ki@@ osk on the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment project of traders with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and , is considered to be much more efficient in the core city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the city council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales ski@@ station on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new business@@ men but at this location in exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not match , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director crus@@ hes Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after an &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media rebellion after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not have a list of Israeli pres@@ election as Arab guests were requested by an employee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotels country selection list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and er@@ ased ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason behind it was , in the director , more anger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann has been cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and shocked by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this was added to this hotel chain in Germany , is even more dis@@ grace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel under@@ lined that it would have given the aff@@ ection@@ ate response to Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the name of the hotel that is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm in the vicinity of a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; sorry &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to include Israel in the quick list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added now .
police force tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ war@@ ks against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ war@@ ks against the demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to dis@@ courage the students , leading to rub@@ bing the police and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the prot@@ esters looked gra@@ ff@@ iti against the preliminary President , Michel Tem@@ er at walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been reli@@ eved of office by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian enterprises take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Russian foreign representatives visited around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the country , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking for witnesses : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest bread
a rob@@ ber@@ y accident occurred on Thursday evening on the beverage market by Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the approval of a fire@@ arm , three dark@@ ly dressed persons , who had mu@@ zz@@ led their faces , picked up cash from the employee of the drink bar and then presumably escaped with a silver VW Golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators must be known in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , and escaped from the gravel car park located opposite the parking garage , possibly heading towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , who stand in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nag@@ old : playing and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational day group / social group work of the children &apos;s shelter Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors on their summer free time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quiet , secluded spa town of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , it went to rescue with the visit of the string zoo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the other to the Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Deep Sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited to jump , swimming and p@@ add@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and car@@ ers were cul@@ led with their self @-@ prepared body@@ work such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in workshops , it was developed , creating beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ ye@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ j@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg along a four @-@ day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , four stages were overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage trip of all the mini @-@ regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the St. Anna ministers group decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various pilgrimage destinations were checked and one finally decided for the Bischof@@ s@@ stadt Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt went on their way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and told the Pil@@ gri@@ mage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Hor@@ b we went by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster &apos;s beloved wife is standing and so the pilgrimage took place from the Mu@@ enster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly played R@@ ast to sing together a song from specially produced pilgri@@ m songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for overnight stays , parish communities of the local parish were available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the stage goals , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of a tasty and stimulating dinner and breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , one took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , at a low heat had to be lowered about 500 m altitude and then be heard again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening , the earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a small impulse , God was given thanks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , there was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home , when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last evening in the male team Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the London 2012 title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow accepted the anchor , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y made his way to E@@ igen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated the trick after being in March at the World Championships in London , despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Green . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did this in time , as a hin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gary &apos;s retirement created a gap , Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic ord in qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders conquered in the first round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his lap he was scar@@ ce back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , moving in a higher gear to slow it down and make it Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they stepped onto the podium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just here to do my best , and make me a name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic ord and defeated the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der announced that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he returned this statement later , and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for such a superior victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three months , we have come together as a team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with so many world titles , we have come so badly that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the range of possible that he repeated the winning of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( apparently holy date for British sport ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels a bit lonely , alone to win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be defeated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the only contest of the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins is focuss@@ ed on safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , he cont@@ ested with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which continues and ends tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UK team relies on its strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games , and get a band of med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a truly exceptional depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dra@@ mas performed in the background , such as the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical manager in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ ak , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if you look at the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which at the perfect moment has reached its climax again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
future of the melting pot of Port@@ land on the basis of lifting the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby elev@@ ates all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company rus@@ hes forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 20 years , the prevention of subsi@@ dy will exp@@ ire in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ co@@ a facility in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no less than 2,000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt is consumed about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 Al@@ co@@ a closed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Al@@ co@@ a melt in Port@@ land loses money , and risks a closure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , communicated with the fact that three further owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p maintain smaller portions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the treaties were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts at its annual sales figure of $ 18@@ 7 million , expecting a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ a said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; capability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the melt , or to ensure the power supply to the enam@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US company said that it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have come into force from November this year even if it is still guilty of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago some 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity annually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as generating sets it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the sought @-@ after September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der , ran and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on its Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) similar to the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ on@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest . they all have a surprise party planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ ed act almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of karma started with certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s great sister Kim likes them what the Vo@@ gue @-@ Cover is concerned ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Vo@@ gue , the September edition is the most sold edition of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles an image tape rather than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were advertis@@ ers 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revelation of his super@@ star is expected so long to see that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine are still filtered out before the official announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , mod@@ els &quot; than &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or Brand Ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous individuals or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success is not everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always tense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ tes of the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these feelings came up again , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the vo@@ gue cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to run around , the point seems to pass by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in her free time , she is seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; municipal councils have 16@@ 0.000 people each year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; annually , more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies are rejected by the municipal offices , while the industry is looking forward to the effects of further mid @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and the like - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell community center , said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal councils concluded that thousands of people have already rejected thousands of people every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation would only be even worse , without the resolution of the Federal Government &apos;s resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal offices are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who leave violent relationships , families with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who were dischar@@ ged by separ@@ ations , all these people have problems of legal nature and this elevation shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to delay these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to see the needs of the community centers and their community communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Choice Camp@@ a@@ ign after Staff allegedly drew up weapon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump Camp@@ a@@ ign has been accused of alleged in@@ action , having been informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina visited an employee in February , while she was on a je@@ ep in February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident was described in a indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ uss admitted to have been waiting for months that the matter would be regulated internally , before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; moved a pi@@ sto@@ l , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the run in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ uss noted that at least four other persons had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he admitted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the charges were issued only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate dissolved a rebellion , when a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sl@@ umps campaign clearly indicated that the media would have torn out its words from context and that it would not be offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ uss &apos;s complaint demands damages from the campaign for violation of due diligence , and by Philip because of bodily injury and remaining psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cane spokes@@ man in Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on calls with his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has led a controversial campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : the SPD and the CD@@ U lose
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , substantial losses for the SPD and the CD@@ U are notable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute , In@@ sa for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the North , this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing the head of government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent , five years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey , the party sm@@ iled just just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated at 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) back to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 3 per cent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey , the SPD of the survey would only come to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still sm@@ iled behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Ab@@ ge@@ ord@@ net@@ enhaus with 14 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; email and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the success@@ ors dominate the world - his producer experienced a disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device weighed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good in the hand either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was pretty bul@@ ky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initially , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; was launched exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few Euros , lovers can buy equipment still on the Internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover , as the &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser , even if agon@@ izing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a small antenna , and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen were found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 1996 , no one could guess that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then everything is different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile phone sector experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the market is dominated by providers who came a lot later than Nokia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always and everywhere online , that is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running deals of countless app vendors and telecommunications companies are coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market occurred only in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything easy to use via touch screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , the iPhone is the most important product of the group today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seeds now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on average , every German now sees 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn how to get the smartphone away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , permanent availability is now considered as a curse and blessing at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring innovation and prosperity to local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London , to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local companies and companies near He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will create 10,000 new jobs alone , creating 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that think that the challenge of the expansion He@@ ath@@ row is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two @-@ fl@@ yers had wron@@ ged in 2012 , and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not a single infrastructure project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion of wit@@ ch@@ able growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row that has implemented a £ 11 billion of the infrastructure investment program in time and budget from the T@@ 5 - the five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal was built up to the T@@ 2 which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB , and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will be one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trading , and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse play &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempt to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop side would change the encoding for his advertisements to make it difficult to detect which part of the page advertising is advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in and fr@@ o battle has been in progress between the time @-@ loos@@ ening open source community , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how high concern display lock@@ ers have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company specializes in ad blocking on desktop PCs , because mobile ad blo@@ wers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of income , so Facebook will be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; ad preference tool &quot; to allow people to have more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ Blue was wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences instead of putting more control into the hands of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
woman at alleged suicide on Swiss motorway
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim was in the middle of the night , on the highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are calling for witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours passed on Thursday during a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident took place on the A1 near Morges , in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , including a truck , was willing to kill himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she died still on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , who sum@@ mon@@ ed them and every witness of the incident to report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter told the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last five years , two similar cases show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the free@@ way , it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was called in the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after passing a man and killed one night in August 2014 on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and has become unconscious in the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to a call -- was justified in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhabited
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have her@@ ded similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution , which was suspected previously by planet researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it was presumably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years -- exposed too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their oceans evapor@@ ated , and their steam was fired from ultra@@ violet light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as its hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions , which influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being met .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we appreciate all that he has done for our organization , and wish him the best for the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his debut season Roy was awarded the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams award , as the best coach of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he took the club on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and dropped behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal &apos;s and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ des@@ eed oil workers resume talks , strike out strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding the remuneration of the North Sea oil workers will be exposed , while all parties sit at the table for a new discussion round , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of the present strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will pause several full day sessions in the coming weeks , beginning next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts are needed for the company , in order to get through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was strengthened by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes , which took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why the stars rotate in the star cluster to different rates , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are with planet creation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which have ar@@ isen about 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at peak rotation rates , these stra@@ y stars encounter large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a star is aged , its rate of rotation begins to slow down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest publication of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars rotate slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cluster of stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , when and why stars slow their rotation rates , so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star emerges
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , tears run faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was chosen the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his signature , under a ten @-@ year contract , gave him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he managed to achieve some mil@@ estones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old cannot be recorded in the Hall Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field , his appearance is outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was entitled &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect , who has been working for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even his farewell days are not silent , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job ent@@ ails an attempt to win any game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az with act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy and sympathy from the Yan@@ ke@@ e ore riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the followers were singing at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi and Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ f@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Go@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing accidents .
a know@@ led@@ geable athlete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese swimming female Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski , were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the very critical athle@@ tics competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Sunday , Ch@@ en had proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a mas@@ king remedy for dop@@ ing substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court of CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ flies , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the talks over 50 m of free style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B trial and a hearing has been submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the night of Rio , the news filtered through the positive sample of Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the report , it is said to act in the forbidden substance for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal was already positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately announced himself with criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t have the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , about all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class of up to 85 kg has been tested positively to the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both deny the ing@@ es@@ tion , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Federation IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian squ@@ ad , except for systematic dop@@ ing . Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China also ensured severe disputes between athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of open @-@ style I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Sun stood at the center of an engagement with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 Sun was positively tested with the Chinese champ@@ ionships for the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three month block . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data @-@ blue : so per@@ fi@@ de , h@@ ack@@ ers squee@@ ze their ran@@ som &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , programmers from black@@ mail access are targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a recent survey conducted by the malware Defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 per cent of surve@@ yed companies were at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som funds required by the perpetr@@ ators , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the observation of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize on attacks in company networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are successful there , the potentially er@@ ased ran@@ som is much higher than for private users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently observe an alar@@ ming rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , most of the mal@@ warning programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , private users were the goal , but the change towards corporate attacks was fri@@ ghtening in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ altered files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware , and delete the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ graph Bit@@ coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but where private users have the personal photo database at stake , companies need sensitive customer data or project databases without shut down the production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the damage is higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 percent of Germany &apos;s German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case , people were in danger of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try to build a good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers examined the usage areas and contact with black@@ mail , and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if private individuals are saved to payments of a few hundred Euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to return their data un@@ encrypted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the potentially high and relatively low risk gains from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit , to the actual black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the existing malware kits have been created by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ids are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so one log@@ ins in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the payment is made per infected machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ Sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is known for many companies that better secure their data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over 50 per cent of the corporate IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on enabling Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the potential of damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could have completely new goals on the internet of things on the crop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the defl@@ ector press conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the perpetr@@ ators are then blocking an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the little HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems small , the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the rear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interior materials are well @-@ crafted and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top falls apart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is in storage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ placed and 10@@ 26 l at back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is less magical than it sounds like : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a swivel chair and thus offer storage space , which is height up to 1.@@ 24 m from the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the charge height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should do his job , however , a bit more quiet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , steering should be a little more direct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment is nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the City emergency braking assistant is one of the security systems ( works until pace 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assistant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because when manoeu@@ v@@ ring many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote lighting assistant works very reliably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign detection , and throt@@ tles the speed if required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI bus@@ hing are located under the arm@@ rest , and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel starting from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the HR V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a liability is conceivable only for hazards that are typical of aviation , the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court argu@@ ing ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken down a knee , in the fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
disease case : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their trip , only then will they get money back if the cause of illness is without doubt in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests showed the same symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the case , a family was severely ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their illness returned to a defective treatment plant , which supposedly polluted sea@@ water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family was in view , the trip was so poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the organis@@ er learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not hurt his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the samples of water , no contamination was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to con@@ ta@@ gion , belongs to the general risk of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were only 38 guests of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be so@@ ber , and decided at the same time to react on terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if perpetr@@ ators had to leave the country more quickly , this increases the security and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a tran@@ sposition of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ sized scale over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sympath@@ iser for terrorism must be punished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the tru@@ ce will be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères , the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors should be maintained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions how the danger of citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to counter@@ act a radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers must be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister declared itself clearly against shareholders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a cow@@ ard@@ ly for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union , after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general prohibition of full @-@ wear@@ iness , however , is problematic under constitutional law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t ban everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talk about rules about street traffic , or for witnesses against court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green Chief Sim@@ one Peter designed the minister , aiming to simulate new anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els tat@@ too and action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Staff and a tightening of the right to the right bring no more safety to people in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it st@@ umps regularly on the b@@ ypass road , here a picture of November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal remedy is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the ambient road every evening in traffic jams , when they drive over the free@@ way ( A 43 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler Strasse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , drivers can thread directly from the Hammer road on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage : the traffic for@@ ks early , thus improving the overall schedule on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driving tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory on the feeder nerves the drivers , above all , between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on week@@ days the back@@ stage extends up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ e , and sometimes beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason , the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 is shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Strasse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from here , traffic is only guided through the motorway bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second track had to be rebuilt in a good three @-@ quarters , three @-@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity , in order to absorb two @-@ lane particul@@ ate traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected work @-@ day traffic will continue , the competent regional company cannot say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , with years to be expected : because the bridge has an official rest period until 20@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal agreement , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday and Wednesday , traffic will be lane @-@ lane on the construction site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intercultural journey : cultural activities for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece , &quot; Das invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a musical project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s society allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has introduced an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy Theater Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the staging at the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , the association aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between September 2015 and March 2016 most of the students of the class came from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boys Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together as part of a musical theatre project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from October to December , young people should be able to attend professionally guided courses in singing , dance , acting and music between 14 and 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offers for children and families in theatre play and theatrical language education are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ra@@ ins instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather has made the star @-@ shooting Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south west of Germany at night a grain through the bill , but there is still hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night was poorly suited for clouds and rain , the chair@@ woman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relaxing night : tips to sleep disorders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is all else , as relaxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , one is with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are sleeping problems or sleeping problems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes underlying them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Society for sleep and sleeping medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is a single and a sleeping disorder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just listening to sleep is perceived as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German House Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not rarely , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is most common in a depression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it may be , that different factors would like each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can sleep poorly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to gr@@ ind over everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should go to the doctor , should go to the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distur@@ b@@ ance can look very different : one is de@@ pressed , tired , sle@@ epy , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany there is little head@@ line specialist , Professor In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first contact the family doctor , advises wo@@ ollen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with tests , it can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in case of snor@@ ing with respir@@ ators , for example in sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers , for sleeping trans@@ duc@@ ers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it is not necessary to prepare for the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disgu@@ sting , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on your finger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a camera draws the sleeping @-@ end to the ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are quite many adjusting screws , where you can sit for better sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ eks counts : regular sleeping and standing up , not sleeping too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep watching television for falling asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not at all con@@ duci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself , on Facebook , the dis@@ ap@@ pointing down@@ cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2014 , he first collected gold at the Doh@@ a Short Railway Championships and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the former DS@@ V athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his ex @-@ team mates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20.000 € bonus and a jungle King 15@@ 0.000 € won &apos;t be surprised at missing med@@ als , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system in swimming is poor , but dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries who promote a lot and do not see it as accurately or even operate it in the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like that , you should keep it with countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent controllers in WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : ban@@ anas det@@ ained by baggage
professional thi@@ eves at D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , civil servants of the Düsseldorf Police were able to hold two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a band , the Tat@@ too did have several pick@@ pockets and bag ste@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials recognized a gang in the area of the Düsseldorf airport , which was known to the police officers from past anti @-@ theft crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two women and two men had committed several offen@@ ders since the middle of July and , in the process , have been jointly and particularly professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists of the Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department 34 can demonstrate the Di@@ alogue , which had been submitted to Germany specifically for the operation of criminal off@@ ences in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , they had captured a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between yet another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem so , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walking the road from the east to the west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house , someone has ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl that will soon be demol@@ ished , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; fashionable district , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in men@@ tions , however , in recent weeks , however , it is prefer@@ enti@@ ally bil@@ led with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin internal sen@@ ator handle had spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police cleared three weeks official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cab@@ s on the ground , locked up parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of houses in the sun , others are talking about Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who attracts three children here , are mainly general of the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the residents of the houses , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a neighborhood , which mostly wanted police protection from v@@ and@@ alized lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dit@@ ch , which the internal sen@@ ator and the police open between home owners and their neighbours , obviously does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; neighborhood , which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them nearly the entire Main@@ zer Strasse in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a controlled street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly occupied by the people they occupied 26 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly magnet for tourists and vot@@ er liners from around the world : with them residents of the GDR times and former houses share their neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at thrown slices or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with colour bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one reason why not all neighbours look at that as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body injury statistics result almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences make non @-@ damage , which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they were not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the famous burning cars don &apos;t give it any longer directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately pulled into the Riga street , and remained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why it was so important for her to get back on her streets : from the police , politics and the media which suddenly claimed the distinc@@ tiveness of the district in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to take them away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former building gaps that are displac@@ ing the old inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people - here people who are not so well @-@ dressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what can you do , if you never listen to someone ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects , and the left @-@ hand scene , belonged to Kie@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone moving into a pub area , can complain about noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all persons , only with the first names , asked not to be named with their proper name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the asylum officer for Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now here to have the exhau@@ sting wool mil@@ k@@ sau which has a problem above all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed rather than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant , as the administration wanted to write out the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for an administrative expert with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an exhau@@ sting wool mil@@ k@@ sau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , administrative work is not the central area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has a 50 percent place for three years , with limited duration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new containers are soon standing in the washing line
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been , for some time , to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been acknowledged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must put the refugees in their own or rented apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
responsibility changes from the administrative office to the municipality and the Job@@ center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time , the search has been very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , it has not been working to rely on private dwell@@ ings , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , communal dwell@@ ings must be emp@@ tied , as it is so nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the washing line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but only with apartments , it is not done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment skills for refugees and migrants who need to be gre@@ ased or furnished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many work in the building yard or help house master builders , do non @-@ profit work - and that &apos;s motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , activity does not only mean work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , here too , administration and honorary members jump here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany , and welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it takes a long time to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he could not help anybody in Ur@@ bach won &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be integrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also problem cases , says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a difficult question : did the two after recent events fear radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer clearly says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the helpers have already been sensi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these incidents were also subject to the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were afraid that the assass@@ ins brought them completely in demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the main and honorary official must look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , they always have in the background that a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer also clearly shows that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar looking for helicop@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about an hour , the police helicopter flew off several areas - un@@ successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two unknown men were forci@@ bly penet@@ rated at 8.@@ 50 a.m. on Friday morning , into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people surprised the two , and struck the ung@@ o@@ dly into the escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ die pul@@ lis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they fled toward the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the brief@@ ing , the police put several strips of stri@@ pe and a police helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gro@@ unding went without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the unknown , indeed , fell close to the apartment or during their escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police search for rock@@ ers attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an attack on an Ulm I@@ mb@@ iss , the police were investigating six susp@@ ects from the ro@@ cker caused by severe land@@ mines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of housing searches , evidence and intoxic@@ ants were ensured , the police reported on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 20 mas@@ ked men of a ro@@ cking @-@ like group@@ ing had thrown bottles and stones of an i@@ mb@@ is@@ ses , according to the police in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , they are supposed to attack two guests and have injured one easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they fled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the I@@ mb@@ iss and the adjacent building there was a damage of 10,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to investig@@ ators , there is a dispute in the Ulm Ro@@ cker@@ mi@@ lieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thur@@ in@@ gia : Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec came closer to sales @-@ billion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a high demand for medical technology in Asia has stimulated the sales of Carl Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first nine months of the financial year that started in October , consolidated sales rose by 6.@@ 7 percent to 7@@ 9@@ 8.@@ 6 million euros , such as the listed company on Friday in Jena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Asian business grew dispro@@ portion@@ ately by 17.@@ 1 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the interim balance of 8@@ 9.5 million euros , earnings before interest and taxes increased to EUR 1@@ 10.@@ 5 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this fiscal year , the Jena Medical Technology Group wants to exceed the sales figure of one billion euros , the board re@@ affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
