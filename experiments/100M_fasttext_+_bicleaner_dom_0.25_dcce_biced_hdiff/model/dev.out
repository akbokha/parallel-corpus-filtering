Obama welcoming Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement , as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been tense for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington has critic@@ ised Israel &apos;s continued settlement of settlements , and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the deal of the Iranian nuclear program promoted by Obama , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block . I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ mark Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after the shooting at the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as those who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students said , that they were looking forward to their teaching . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ce died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with which he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty contains 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , there were some in@@ clin@@ ations about problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , Lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had some health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard , would be no guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before being arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received his doctorate in the spring of Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends called him intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een , he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago on a summer fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , they played one or the other gig together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse working online for various companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said he had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were in the clearing , and j@@ oked with each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , initiated the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of the Brotherhood and the Student Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the M@@ ahn@@ awake guard during the Univers@@ ity@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and and Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story has been corrected in order to refu@@ te that the police had shot the emergency after he shot himself , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss , but there is no indication that the two ever got married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Toys R Us says that it will not be so many Christmas @-@ season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it will start with job interviews this month , and the number of employees is increasing from October to December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the holidays , the Christmas market is approaching and businesses are preparing to hire time workers to equip retailers with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back to the Future , the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty beside me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am removed from a date with the Princess of Wales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had premi@@ ered 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five year lasting conflict ; and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN leader reiter@@ ates all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - to discuss the situation in Syria this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers could make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , demonstrating the same solidarity and unity that they have proved in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 8 survey values , showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some have tried to brand him out as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led the lead to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now realise sl@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Any scor@@ ching values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans viewed the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three out of ten , they have a negative opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these numbers are in the early states , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent that say the same over tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in the field of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of the Repub@@ lican voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see umps of temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters have believed that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number is valid in the first nation state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , 44 per cent think he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 Independent say that his temper@@ ament was not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repub@@ lican voters apply to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they raise their honor @-@ hats , repub@@ lican voters keep them for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C , four of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time when four out of ten , July , put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er Tr@@ ump Camp@@ a@@ ign campaigns can be viewed as plau@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered for another Candi@@ date , Tr@@ ump stops almost everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts point out that the spl@@ inter@@ ed field is likely to contribute to tr@@ umps , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between tr@@ ump and most other repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he pointed out to C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump Fans says , that they formed their minds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new pol@@ l by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters support Tr@@ ump , say they have awarded their votes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said they leave the door open , in order to switch to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump in the topic of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , the immig@@ rant from Mexico , called &quot; rapi@@ er , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will be far from the Repub@@ lican Party , and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs on new high@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of repub@@ lican voters , especially their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they want to have a political out@@ sider rather than someone with experience in government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg , the most expensive residential complex is located - overlooking the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the street , a square meter of a loft apartment costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new study shows , in which special locations a square meter is the most cost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate service provider angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites , with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , scheduled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but well , who can afford it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , Munich is not at the top of the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
champ@@ ions League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star , Thomas Müller , has just a run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a happy hit by Thomas Müller , the FC Bayern , smooth@@ ed the way to an earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Got@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start into the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion of the Olympic Games in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ s + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller received his 28th consecutive hits in the Champions League for Bayern leader@@ ships , Roberto , who had managed to pass a shot of the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium - and the Munich stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed a concentrated and committed notion , without shine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus has won his latest six home games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was proud ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but with their offensive efforts often too resour@@ ceful to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks were initiated too often by shifting the game shift to left @-@ gun Douglas Costa , which was rarely crossed against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k collap@@ sed from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in half of one , Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown suggested the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then by direct debit , the keeper Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 35 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Bav@@ arians raised their domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set need@@ le@@ punch holes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he was reli@@ eved of go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for instance , when he distra@@ c@@ ted a shot from ide@@ ye about the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola presented a four @-@ string quartet with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in Ka@@ der , sat at first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training session , &quot; said Lei@@ feld Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller took another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the game , there was a crash in the stadium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of partly displaced Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator @-@ bloc apparently provoked the supporters of host pi@@ vot@@ ees with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smoke , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smoke , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good news : when ren@@ unciation , risk decreases rapidly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smoking was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to increase the 2.8 to 3,@@ 6 fa@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists had observed more than 3,@@ 300 participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main causes of tooth loss are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and loss of teeth go back to more frequent gum infections in smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers are writing in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smokers , journalist H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health until age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study maintains the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum are excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always attracted as an office for archaeological excav@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists were now fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from text documents , it has already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had been a church , Trier explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves which probably belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young woman of freight train detected
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman died at the railway station in the Gei@@ gh@@ ir@@ chen arter@@ ies , the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 clock , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the acquisition of the train , she has carried serious injuries to the federal police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was listed on site , and brought to hospital by rescue workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly gli@@ ding crossing of the young woman , no knowledge is available to the educ@@ ating officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident was perhaps observed by witnesses , or residents heard acoustic percep@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in question , residents or pass@@ ers by Lin@@ der@@ ner railway , brick bak@@ eries , Thom@@ as@@ farm road and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information provided on the cause of the accident can be given under the telephone number 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station , under the telephone number 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration scheme to increase the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states must therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function matches significantly more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Commissioner @-@ commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to launch the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to come up with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely show that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , a second instance is provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would allow it to appeal against judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their jud@@ gements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , it intends to work towards an international investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , who are able to dispute compensation for tax pa@@ yers , cut national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first draft opinions , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ ania , designated the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it has been critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered significant points in the reform that the Federal Foreign Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked out in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the French government , too , welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of it , the European business association business Europe warned against restric@@ ting the business of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when discussions can be concluded on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he talks about different places , which he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where they arose and what it looks like , in his homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a forced series : each of the 50 US states should be ob@@ s@@ essed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and the proximity of the Rhine has already appeared &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans , &quot; and suddenly canc@@ els certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live with him , guitar and ban@@ jo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year later , the new York @-@ living musician returns to the series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ise &quot; ) , a masterpiece that is widely celebrated in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crossing ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album desc@@ ends into the American Bill@@ board charts , and is missing in any list of the most influential music media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then works on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic distribution pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth full studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle consisting of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the dark ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he primarily presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although almost 2000 guests are now running in their chairs , the clearly traveled St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience , one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can basically throw the &quot; plate away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to an en@@ core would St@@ ev@@ ens would like to thank , playing acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows down with thunder@@ ous applause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ c@@ ture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ c@@ ture will be eag@@ erly awaited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ c@@ ture , and for the first time he will invest with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will raise himself to answer the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , where his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts , &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that he could skip some sessions , to leave them to colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and focuses on several newspaper stories in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shadows were refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC &apos;s political correspon@@ dent says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour , namely Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit in profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference , that Labour MEPs set forward to remove the whole idea of a limit overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to a £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is a T@@ ory leader , over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy approach says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ l@@ ington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire is to be confronted with reluc@@ tance to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle will be represented by Angela Eagle if he is not participating - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also taught the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the under@@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show . &quot; but a few years later he cleaned out that he failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Fra@@ ges@@ se was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Po@@ und increases by accelerated contract growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound jump@@ ed according to data , which indicate an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this percentage was the fastest and quick@@ est , in 2009 , at the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pound climbed by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % , after taking over from the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after encouraging news from the competition company for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rich@@ mond &apos;s latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that sales in China , a key market for Bur@@ berry , reported growth again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stocks of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.@@ 3 % decrease after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of J@@ D Sports said that higher wages end@@ anger expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the bags of potential customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the be@@ aver construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster is hanging in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa ear@@ ns in half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wik@@ tori@@ a should sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot;

who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also be@@ aver himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for advertisement in the advertising break of the Super@@ Star , he collected three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company , many dollars on the be@@ aver bank account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with every doll , which looks like it and goes over the counter , be@@ aver also assists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window plate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 100 million , it is said to have captured this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the USA and Great Britain , with his new single &quot; What do you mean &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least he does so .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , a grill sk@@ ewer with meat and potatoes has been sto@@ cked in his shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach &quot; says Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea has now sur@@ rendered to the Patent Office in Munich , meanwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with its customers , culinary international understanding is well received . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ a ki@@ cks off ground @-@ scale campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - collapse
Met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an alpine march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a stand @-@ up campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of an 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , the I@@ GA brand strengthens its relationships with local food suppliers and build up the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ GA traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes tast@@ eful tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and equipment will conduct its annual investor @-@ strategy day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut out about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers might lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost Met@@ a around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s decline in food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 , reducing market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ a contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2010 , the market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s food and food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has dropped by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction on sales and margins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wholes@@ aler has refused and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products every week and to deliver a better choice of home @-@ label food products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2017 , Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop rehabilitation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
than@@ asia Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
than@@ asia Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
than@@ asia Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise from the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather than criticism for his own behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the not@@ orious discussion of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soon afterwards , in a fiery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a crash of a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Lan@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am rather en@@ vious is the fact that after my view than@@ asia a little was drawn into the fight , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has broken a bat when he lost due to a crash in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket with himself , and I know than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too strict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a very irrit@@ able 19 @-@ year @-@ old he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on he has never had a problem with the other players he is well in shape he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to refrain from Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he assures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term permanent component . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around it , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think Nick has made a very quick reference to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency situation and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to stop illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with indignation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people , who fled from violence , stuck in a land strip on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fru@@ stration was rising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian intervention police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people came back from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister stated that it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary , while more and more , arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block , in a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over @-@ ump@@ ed Italy and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a bal@@ ing action of Brussels or his neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it had ended a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison cells were deployed in the race , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viktor Or@@ ban , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly contradic@@ ts other EU states including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which occurred around midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence to build the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency situation , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree on the military use of the military , expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that 45 people were attempting to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and accused of comm@@ itting crimes following the new laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , authorities are quick to repair the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos surrounding the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to penetrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the most important auto@@ bahn connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in National Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race round the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is channel for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates will support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some profit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton holds a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage with the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance on the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the Democratic voters of the local elections say that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them , because she is the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wouldn &apos;t support six percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter , they would be enth@@ r@@ alled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 percent of the Democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approval to deal with the problems and the availability are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third thinks he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Bi@@ den decided not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage increases against S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has declined from 78 percent in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage which sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the last month , no single Demo@@ crat candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , provide good results with some important traits in voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den regard maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as foreign minister continues to be made , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public all in all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was wor@@ sen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest , trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the voting rights are not trust@@ worthy and un@@ trust@@ worthy nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks on leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush practice hon@@ esty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than frank@@ ly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey close by Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , half of the support of the voters in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ survey conducted by Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the pol@@ l of Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups , and has sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump among repub@@ lican voters with higher education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , except for C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ therine , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell to the lowest of 10 % in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % , and was conducted in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son stands in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump , clearly ahead of Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump Faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for swimming vac@@ ation@@ ers to find warm water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bath in the north or Baltic Sea may be a little pleasure , at a maximum of 17 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , beach temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood contaminated with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost two years after a student died during a deportation ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials said he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and claimed an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they had the time to goo@@ fy D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood in principle by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ak@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning in his injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt power injury to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died of the Sch@@ ik@@ anen every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fr@@ ater@@ ni@@ ties and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the third degree , for the first five members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of a criminal attack and the formation of a criminal association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to make responsible people responsible , but if there is an organization that officially or officially - this sanc@@ tioned , &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has withdrawn its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a raise of interest comes , and the house will be shaken , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we do not know is how long it will take , and how long it will last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recession came after the first rate of interest within just 11 months , and lasted for 86 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , however , market participants could find out that all the excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as seen in the market last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that fortune yields will be accounted for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more precisely , the market has been on the way to interest rate in the past 35 years , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that published Bob D@@ oll , Chief Operating Officer at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ den@@ ci@@ ally occur later in the increase cycle , and the return on yield will begin to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases them often . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that didn &apos;t exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank in 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP was 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlan@@ ta F@@ ed data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rises in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market participants have set themselves to raise interest rates throughout the year , and all eyes were targeted at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ended on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the raising cycles of 1950 up to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions are made very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fixed income was also volatile , given the market an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bonds appear to change the direction , as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the bond issues fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter loans , leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly galvan@@ ic bonds often result in better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jones states that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , lending margins have increased , lending margins have increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed sharpen@@ ed its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and the whole , companies that use the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multinational companies with high debt are becoming worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the average by 5 percentage points after each interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) , and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
debts become a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are most losing , Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dou@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice , saying that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turned &quot; zu Classic FM , &quot; claims a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do anything that the private tran@@ smit@@ ters do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC boss that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be The Br@@ its only under a different name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously called examples where you can only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC @-@ General Director rejected the accus@@ ations , argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and enlightenment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I learn about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works on behalf , I &apos;m really important &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it needed to be harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production during the hearing held in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports to tread the commercial ri@@ vals into the feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated costs of £ 22 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show , with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want the company to find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we start a series of entertainment for the next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future , or to issue money for other entertainment formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; net sales rose in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , there were the lowest earnings since the start of records in 2000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , sales increased by using mobile phones for shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday stopped spending in November , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but experts say that there are signs that online sales will stagn@@ ate , after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index for the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now that happens , and we may experience that growth decreases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for failing revenues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers looked around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites drop off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium was found out , that £ 5 spent a little over £ 1 online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of men bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first funeral in Mec@@ ca , through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse , some of the huge Saudi O@@ Bin Laden Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane crashed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain who were killed , when a crane at Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filled , largely dressed in white , the route to declare their respect when the first of the dead started their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funeral procession was passing by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corp@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king over the bin Laden &apos;s construction company was arrested for the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 operators , who were killed when a crane struck by the Great Central mosque Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane desc@@ ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que , with his parents prior to the beginning of the annual hat@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated that they will continue to continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stand when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the Saudi Press Agency , said that Bin Laden group was responsible for the breakdown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the information agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was out@@ law@@ ed abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised that which caused the overthrow of the crane , rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Great mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the p@@ add@@ ling that was held later this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden group has not issued statements about the breakdown of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures , and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mec@@ ca Gross@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the ruler family of Saudi Arabia and takes over larger construction projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was dra@@ fted by the family in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crash of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay hospit@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same sum of permanently injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other players will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has increased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that British will put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European arti@@ sans , who carry out work in their homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you apparently belong to a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to carry home jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low prices , is now out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops dedicated to tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants more women in B &amp; Q shop , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are hit by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , which have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that employs 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group reduced the cost of closing the stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dispens@@ ation on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of mis@@ use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the years 2006 to 2011 , the def@@ endants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out funds from club accounts through which they were allowed to dispose in their functions for private purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he paid the damage to around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sports officials are also accused of financial difficulties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact was eliminated by the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that no asset was created at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials would only offset expenses and had invested the sports club for which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the B@@ read profession , told the financial officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take on this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money that insur@@ es our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the seizure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial success , the withdraw@@ als of the expense compensation have been retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the expense allowance had been paid only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was paid in the account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Pau@@ ler and not detailed illustrations , the former chairman himself explained the proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and spar@@ es managed the two def@@ endants together , said the second def@@ endant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial crisis , it is important that only the freedom of debt has been , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account against the official investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the case , the def@@ endants explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account ran to the name of the second def@@ endant , and according to its statement the association was not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on top of that , the respon@@ dent did not know any response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he finally said , he thought this was the best for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something had happened to him , nobody knew anything about that money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ accused was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claims compensation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why damage compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on top of that , the first def@@ endant ple@@ aded that he had not agreed with this formulation because the association was never damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further , the function@@ ary , he never ordered a cent salary , he only comp@@ uted mil@@ eage and diets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exact documents for the early years , the def@@ endants could not demonstrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were no longer retained after an operating examination , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the second def@@ endant was also indic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the changes were made in cash , for that he had to drive from his hom@@ etown to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he said in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main hearing will be continued on September 23 , with the interro@@ gation of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , there will be further jobs at the time the company spl@@ its up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the exploitation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , costs are to be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company shared on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exploitation of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listed below , the Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share gave 2.3 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which has been raised with printers from Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently concentrating on : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer came to the latest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the proceeds went back to 15 from 16 quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP responds with a split , and massive positions on change in the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers , and getting more businesses online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan shows a total reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in hos@@ ti@@ lities in Iraq would mostly react to rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other states fly air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent have a positive effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cooperation with Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad reject 51 per cent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of the fair will be on September 27 , networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two days of press release , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility connects &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers of the V@@ DA car association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian fron@@ tier
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian police were deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ nar@@ as , and water laun@@ chers against several hundred indigenous refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind it a police line was formed and behind the polic@@ emen , a water heater was ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , the officials stopped pe@@ pper@@ Spray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the group was dissolved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the refugees have withdrawn somewhat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children , who had entered the tear @-@ gas , cried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other refugees fell in themselves , and suffered under respir@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ people of the Serbian police have also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US staff is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pol@@ l among 80 econom@@ ists , surve@@ yed by Reu@@ ters , found that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a historic event , since it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has set interest on NU@@ LL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the opportunities against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death Sha@@ ke at the Delta State University , leaving certificate writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he could make it impossible , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social sciences at Delta State University , called emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , He has shot on a man and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre , that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I am sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after writing the note , lamb received 300 miles from Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb was supposed to have a relationship with Schmidt , officials said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een who said that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ce was her daughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ce worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb had sum@@ mon@@ ed relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them that &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville on that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring 2015 , lamb received a PhD title from the Delta State University , as he gives his way to life on the university &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stars that have lost their lucky charm
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this certainly calls for its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a better organisation , the Lufthansa Group will save half a billion euros a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1,000 executives will cost the work of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ income Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is an annual contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , announced the airline on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , Lufthansa is no longer responsible for the passenger business in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , CEO Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new setting , Spo@@ hr highlights the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the passage airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conflict conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the strike on this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that divided the union with .
the topic of talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will result in viable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , the conflict between the union and airline has led to various strikes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the wings concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is moving to the Group &apos;s own cheap line of Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luke Sha@@ w , Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while doing the left outside defender for weeping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field , and needed oxygen before it was brought to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow , perhaps a day later and then operate in Manchester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the locker room , he had a oxygen mask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared to be happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at PS@@ V &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the European Championship in France , the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said , &quot; It &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg burst when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing I could see was the ball running in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very badly involved , I &apos;m so sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital , after a F@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , David Cameron knows better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it almost mem@@ orized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , the environmental cable appeared in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron claims to describe the story of the book instead , re@@ gives a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win a real tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if this was not yet suspi@@ cious : the text submitted by Cameron will partly look like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is arti@@ ficially and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named T@@ ed to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , Cameron seems so little familiar to Cameron &apos;s action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said , that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election round office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der who has chosen England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would not exclude a reverse victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown height at test level is an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related news : Adam Ly@@ th dischar@@ ges from the England test cad@@ res , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best choices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago it would have prolonged the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hopefully , if he hopes for further talks for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances , like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance lies now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I set high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to put mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I didn &apos;t do anything about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a dr@@ um@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ hand has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ een has perhaps not done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my previous te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as a op@@ ener in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he immediately made us , and did not look back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ him , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a Master coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour , bringing energy and powerful use into the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the aforementioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ins team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not taken lightly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from the UK from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u , if the economy is in a slu@@ gg@@ ard until 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ exploited new negoti@@ able strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently fought for Europe on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreigners , too , have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at , recently said that some member states are so deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU , and not always from own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they usually do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it even if it end@@ angers social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us not be alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have arrived in some capitals to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long erup@@ tions such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) and Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a seduc@@ tive force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore maybe some such ministers may intentionally not plan any helpful comments , in the SN@@ P style , during the UK refer@@ en@@ um@@ ulation in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press photos is how it supported it during the 1975 referendum held in 1975 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all its cra@@ y@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this included Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acked foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als , most of our major newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , better ban@@ anas are distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming a lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ zing than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed the EU &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir was dismissed by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has never forgiven him , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back on Monday - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s - a mistake at that time and today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I sometimes feel friendly , in the development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blo@@ oming tendency and the wild desc@@ endant of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can probably say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ uties after all reports on their day of departure on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - messages discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media - a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the lecture campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like this .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities in EU membership - in accordance with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ation economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities in Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital , they also have a suspi@@ cious vot@@ er - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US has already been quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power that I was reminded on Monday by something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined L@@ anc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Story report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a leading article in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month picked up the &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy basis , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims were based on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they said the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not provided , but there are several known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include industry funding in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of p@@ he also took part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work says that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , none of these compounds or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at p@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to have long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what proves , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually in an illness with respect to smoking and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by defining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ ers , says former chief of Channel 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like E@@ ast@@ calendar and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be viewed by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee during his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , what I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not make or commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as broad support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Voice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series who led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like E@@ ast@@ calendar should sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they meet their missions , and they can argue if they go on their seem@@ ing missions for justification of $ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they put them in a time window , where no one ever wanted to see them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we all think that for £ 150 a year is given a great value , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their char@@ thi@@ an mission to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of this in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in that moment , in which they are be@@ amed with sound pulses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are heard with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impulses work by switching Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , used by ultrasound to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day would replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ aden@@ worms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they had it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels carry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he uses ultrasound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transmitted to the worms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to light revealed on optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are to be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important An@@ no@@ unc@@ ement : drive from 15 to 18 September with the D@@ LR ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the trademarks of the D@@ LR line that turns into the image of a tank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , a flock of arms dealers will drive with the D@@ LR ... Custom@@ ers are asked to help at the stop of the weapons show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 300 posters have been issued by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Cru@@ el Designs in Ban@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ pack of Allen keys claiming that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

many artists engage with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another of the anti @-@ weapon trade posters , the commu@@ ter in the underground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ nesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which was around advertising for the trade fair - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic display advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a drop in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art around the weapons show comes from within Excel , where exhibitors will be fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago as a self @-@ for@@ getting 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and Moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense sm@@ iles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls is from slightly annoying to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk about where you come from , whether and where you &apos;re coming Sab@@ bat@@ ee and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , contrary to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people often turn into drinks @-@ recipes , film nights venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship with your university , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be hell for someone , who tries to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I can return the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to sense when a student is tired of con@@ vivi@@ ality , and send SMS instead of kno@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the way : do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a guy in my dormit@@ ory homes had the idea , that a closed door was an invitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since you start the university at the height of the Back Man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad ming@@ led cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you drop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
steal food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to their milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should not make any noise , the people from sleep or from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbors whether to make something quiet for them , Drum &amp; Bass , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they re@@ acted to more lu@@ ci@@ d music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , shut up her door and went to her three @-@ hour exam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , if you consider a room@@ mate for your future spouse to go to them again and see them every day , and perhaps witness how they pass all common friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk about your lower abdom@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment when you notice someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security by hiding , but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not rack your possessions at the ceiling more than twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ generation , straight @-@ ear@@ ners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor builds holiday homes for people , who don &apos;t have much money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the only nour@@ ishing mother and the ring ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can build cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : in a project , it builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the people remain a great part here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al and three @-@ storey house is the solution .
Gil@@ deb@@ tor : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facilitates integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is different , if you put people in bed dum@@ pl@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units each for four asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are the costs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do building regulations have complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ deb@@ tor : legally , I correct my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially complicated , it always makes the threat of Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ ky special construction and the parking lot ordin@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cre@@ epy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still subordin@@ ated , who creates three flats in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in cities , the place is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ deb@@ tors : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which is definitely not true .
but don &apos;t you ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ deb@@ tors : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but luxury apartments were built , which hardly could afford more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees , but also the mother or the ring ear@@ ner alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build today , cheap and good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , since they receive an error message that tells you that the &quot; software update has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may mean clearing apps to create space , but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able through the integration of the update . similarly , it will be easier to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating , or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone might turn on half way and this could lead to a crash of the update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full Attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing to lose anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 53 points separate the vice @-@ champion before reti@@ ring in Singapore on this Sunday , defending champion and double champion Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve season races so far , and also took the flood @-@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on could win the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore , it is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ha@@ ze bell has been hanging over the city for days , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago , &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; has added another member in its ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who has more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to cure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen , with a donation received by Alfred Klein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot bring the membership fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
youth work and talent search are to be pushed forward as well .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Bureau seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ isti@@ ft Alten@@ zentrum have gathered under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the social fund takes it down from the mountain to the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more precisely , the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently a new district office was opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on health care or health care insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ atory care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the City hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offers from the retirement centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre , both managers see especially in demographic change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this makes a good de@@ centralised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg , in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Bureau also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and these invite to a regular social gathering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Social Foundation makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our team , it is something special to play against a third party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , as floo@@ d@@ light games have a special charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the round of the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg won first FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the Regional Li@@ sts 1 . FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ year passed away
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus abandoned an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was called in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology in Vienna during and after the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but was also active as a teacher , writer , and institute manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned with the furnishings of the treas@@ ury in Vienna Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
parking fine : Tim Wiese delivers a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese has fallen on in Bremen , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intellec@@ tually , he did not commit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lawn had just left the hair in the inner city center , when he saw how outside a parking space guard issued a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gr@@ ass@@ land was then stor@@ med out of business , insul@@ ted the official and accused her of fine fine for the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says it by the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only after this will be decided whether meadow will be displayed , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the site of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men cried out to the young man , and hit his face with his fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ ls , and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and talked about the ra@@ cket , he departed from his victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from his friends , the last young man was brought home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment , and drove past demonstr@@ atively several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured one went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the help of a head@@ stock , one tested the victim &apos;s face and th@@ igh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 feet tall , and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently doing their specialist training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and who is coming to practice this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steal and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the Müller liked the idea to pursue its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so they agreed , the garbage cans bought the house with the practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the double family father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hannover followed by stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed head physician in the District of Di@@ ep@@ holz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September 19 , practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steal works as a GP , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a house @-@ class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look modern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will offer more ultrasound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk @-@ room more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 50,000 euros is received by the land@@ fill in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ Community mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 2,000 patients come to the field of field breaks according to Silvia mil@@ ler @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice transfer by Frank Müller : the pharmacy still remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no successor was found , it would have gone too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation also continue to look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their farewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients as many times as possible , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds laughing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always pushed myself to gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; said Minister @-@ Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in parallel , the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum will be able to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the care and security of the people is in the foreground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia denied
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany , and to build corri@@ dors for the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see this in such a way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to push its borders for refugees but not to abri@@ dge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already attempted to leave T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in the night hours to avoid the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby ma@@ ize fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , police cars were constantly meeting with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days his country with some 4000 refugees reck@@ on , Home Secretary R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; we cannot , nor do we want to do so , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town S@@ id arrived , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passengers were travelling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has added , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it could actually be a predicted shift in the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ located route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen Member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have consistently held a good testimony to the country as regards the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two fron@@ tiers of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to calm down the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border was closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , it would not be a very high rate of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stock exchanges h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians will pay 30 million dollars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok ought to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of gaining an insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ pac@@ ing and PR @-@ News@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der businesses should have been taken on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside of our borders will ultimately be caught . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the trials against 32 other accused continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators are to act in the United States , as well as from Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim for 20 years
there is a quiet operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people do their concerns , sometimes fast pac@@ ing , partly comfortably st@@ rolling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , bo@@ unc@@ ing life with superb autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die , I want ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce drew attention to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and talks , like volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously acc@@ use to the chal@@ k , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the camper , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , small discussions develop on the br@@ ink of action , about life , dealing with dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that for me at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian facility Mannheim , which is working together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ co carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly on the tables is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject of death and dying is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has greatly helped people to open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an app@@ rais@@ al of Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and funeral service is one of the honorary members of the first hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confronted by personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce by calling an honorary citizen , she immediately reported and was there at the foundation in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can do well with her job and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial support of health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations permits training , training and supervision of the death and mourning accompanying persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every two years , training courses are offered for new employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , too , additional personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed with financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the supply giant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share fell by over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said to earn a profit from 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than with previous forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the price increases , the lower view is expected to be 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which will be le@@ vi@@ ed from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nonetheless expected the result to be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; solid income , considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans for vac@@ ations employment were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS which plans to hire 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 auxiliary workers , approximately the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which reported twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in six of the analysts , analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipment in recent years , which brought sales in its unit express shipments to stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Express Unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank at 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve will spend two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the fence for the first time for almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threatening with them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story seating hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card is a reminder that Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen , and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests before all other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the Congress , keeping US occupation and prices stable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled with unprecedented incentive by the near to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could fri@@ ghten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter of a percentage point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes the financial market uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently surve@@ yed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted a raise this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial markets however expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the impact by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at this point , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she must go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts argued that an interest rate would calm down financial markets , because it would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ellen said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that would require more economic progress , an increase in the sentence expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had utilized its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average rate fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down in China &apos;s economy would threaten global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market has recovered in this month , the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the height of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy did not occur in the last few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authorities have become the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the influence of the central bank has been enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; caused confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to see not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the Company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements linked with apparently not connected to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lack@@ ier , a unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to raise interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce their interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited apparent effects on growth in the United States , &quot; says Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives und@@ o the abbrevi@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of a raise because markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes - Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which also sells to the general public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market / camp is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the entire purchase makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the terraces , and has various take @-@ up options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is there , do you need something - anything - Thai ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; products are inexpensive , and a number of them are sold in large quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meat @-@ counter is extensive , as well as the fish the@@ ke - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even fry on demand for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer section . here you will find Fro@@ zen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and g@@ ale , whole duck , fish , cattle ble@@ ak , fish balls , regional saus@@ ages , commercially prepared food and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owner and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide corri@@ dors are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ ft trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own park area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are coming to Germany , these days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give you a warm welcome , does not work without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people supporting un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she still teaches with her 74 l@@ ences , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this is entirely different from a proper school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brazilian Pap@@ acy Rio Grande , Nutrition for Heal@@ thy Sti@@ ll &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian Pap@@ al Organization SP@@ RS attempts to inform women about how important good diet is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should perform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively influence the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2,@@ 3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be flat for solar installation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planning for the long @-@ lon@@ ged gym construction on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports centre is progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent joint session , the processed building application has been unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , among other things , the panel had decided on an application for a construction legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the exception of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission to form a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of the planning is to use the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; eman@@ cipation , &quot; it was again about the en@@ vy that was prescribed for energy reasons - different from the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan in regard to the at@@ oning does not permit &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally goes rather restric@@ tively in the case of eman@@ cipation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for gymn@@ as@@ tics , there is no recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports centre of the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cost , some 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
grants are expected from the promotion of school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres hall is now presented to the District Office for the review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned , namely 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the station , as well as the majority of employees , move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , September 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 associates would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au , with Fischer and the further existing inner station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rooms are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , the employees who are unable to work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employees were informed of their plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year , has now been transferred to private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who declared himself ready to take over the lead and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to join both houses until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ia , which has more than 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 if the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who also is the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , contra@@ ven@@ ed that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I quit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ psych@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity arises not again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the staff &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as a senior physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent decades the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hand@@ books of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal , but nobody exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past season , the ba@@ star@@ ds raised a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and did a good job there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jag@@ ath with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon , two tractor drivers have been seriously injured by shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police cleared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a shot , a 63 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , it was unclear how exactly it was possible to come to the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police were investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a crime suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing from Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old man killed the youths and threw their corp@@ ses into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing from Saturday , has fallen victim to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corp@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the public prosec@@ utor and the police on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was also indic@@ ative of the fact , was indic@@ ative of the fact that the investig@@ ators were informed about the discovery site of the corp@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning , after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen had not come home as agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators hit the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , the detention centre was reported to have killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the corp@@ se into the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought forward on Wednesday , the Haf@@ cher , the investig@@ ators put a charge on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the further investigations are to be clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the refugees and job@@ seekers coming from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet demand for affordable housing needs 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study arrives on behalf of the Association of Social H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live in an emergency shelter for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many rep@@ el then to the housing market , lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers stayed for rent last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant changes in the housing policy of recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is sliding an apartment deficit coming from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas some 77@@ ,000 units already lack@@ ed , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , many professionals were therefore living in large cities in shared rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the F@@ lau@@ ts in the apartment market , young adults stayed longer voluntarily in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the property tax may be om@@ itted and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , attractive tax depreciation options are necessary according to the Cl@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funding program for refugee camps in the state bank , Kf@@ W , is now working well in towns and villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available amounted to some 300 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia direct corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungary , practically no coming through , there are more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Minister of the Interior , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the de@@ mining of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken down to Croatia to get to Europe from there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day before , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day also practically eliminates the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border to the neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of media reports have been reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they came with both the bus and the taxis in the Serbian border city , S@@ id . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not across borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other dangers , there are still sharp mines left in the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungary , after the closure of the border no more refugees arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , 3@@ 66 people attacked the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the closing on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws stipul@@ ate overcoming and damaging the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sentenced to five years , and expul@@ sion from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older people were among the applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had stopped there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically , however , no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collected garbage , leaving tens of thousands of people in the road@@ side over the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lock grids were disman@@ tled , and one of the record stores in the bor@@ der@@ line was rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one wanted to express itself at the end of this conversion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but about the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after government data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , small groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mayor continued &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were occupied after the Bridge Festival on Sunday when ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins , mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany had suddenly stopped rail traffic with Austria because of the refugee flow , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drew the frames together with two other helpers and their cars across the border into the near Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , we have once again su@@ ed the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man did not allow himself to give a generous donation , 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded pas@@ sage@@ ways had switched from one ICE to a regional train to Passa@@ u in order to stop the railway traffic to Germany , but still to try it over the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the regional train was turned off at the Inn at W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , the Bridge Festival organised a two @-@ bridge course on Sunday , organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends more tens of thousands of thousands to us , a logical result of an apparent policy is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help build structures that guarantee human@@ eness , our Federal Chancellor has officially put the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ i circle of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protag@@ onists of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find out that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landed country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that invited them and welcomed us , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the near hi@@ ber@@ nation to create decent conditions for protection seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof districts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the provision of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Konrad is accustomed to , that his word has weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers , in order to place districts for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos at Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , the first recording centre , has already got a grip on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad uses a demand of 8@@ 5,000 districts in the year of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide the federal states , employing 15.000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without floor , &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial govern@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees of districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it works fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as to how the Church will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ps , like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that the owners have to respect a certain amount of towel holders or the size of the tops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad with his experience , that he was more successful in contrast to the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom you can &apos;t say without further notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to cost , as they stated themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three or four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , his own quest for neighbour@@ hoods has not been successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad wanted to put a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are apparently problems with the approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips and design centers for refugees planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the person concerned is currently unable to accommodate these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of emergency , further sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the city is comm@@ enting on the division of refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , too , other districts must make their contribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me , that the German borders are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the appropriate border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , there will be no special trains with refugees to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for stronger solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , Austria , too , is a logical consequence of the action of Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is drawn up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; said S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies in the New Shi@@ py@@ ard , and later to acquire them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro 1.7 million have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building is watched by Linz AG for 60 years , at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ a opened second business in the arcade
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this project had to boost the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now grown into form of another business location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , several weeks have been converted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I thought for a long time whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive factor in the decision was that the ven@@ eer producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her fashion interest has gotten herself into the cra@@ dle of her mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why so many women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the technical wife with the last certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe it &apos;s up to you , that a beautiful bag will upgrade every outfit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Br@@ ull@@ jon @-@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property also links some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for upright .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he expresses himself hostile , journalists , or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy , the candidate for the US presidential office is boo@@ sting the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cuts well with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also recorded in the P@@ relate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker , with the hair@@ style hair@@ cut , is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place , over -@@ tens of corners , is related to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , to which beside Tr@@ ump is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would be successful also if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the King of the Hear@@ ts , he has not brought it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a bit of a great mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a locomotive for gold graves in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the foundation stone of the real estate group was first real estate sales in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to whom the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once was cut without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ elic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants , this stands in contrast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly spoke about Mexican immigrants in the United States , and demanded the construction of a border wall to fri@@ ghten illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the pol@@ ka , this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement are se@@ greg@@ ating the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension inn@@ keeper Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mention that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not know the election because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pen@@ ed even without President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has long viewed , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ as , also in the USA w@@ akes up interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mountain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; village may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seven &apos;s sunrise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rus@@ hes to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the Moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this down@@ side of the stand did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise aver@@ aged 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators at the five main cities compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sunrise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , sunrise offers an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most interesting thing , what happens every morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winds of change affect this morning crowd , more than the Parliament ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former ser@@ ge@@ ant of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ e Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the outcome of last evening answered , with a clear &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe resulted in an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 until 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that , ultimately , Hot @-@ Se@@ at will prevail at 17 : 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute , which did not manage to over@@ take Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally published as &apos; Sunrise , while Today remains local &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man , but who will he choose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mystery revealed ? ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ki maybe have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up , if she is the one that has received the last rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you might accidentally put an indication of who will be the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly closed on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women had a ly@@ rical manner about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who was to get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay , as the best partner for Wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I stepped into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams Energi@@ es , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it was over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands with both feet on earth , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood is the One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now without reservation , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when asked what Wood should choose , if not , it was pu@@ zzling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on 10 on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the ban@@ ker , when he lost a don@@ key like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return , and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the changing cabin , after the match . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his press conference , Hay@@ ne also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 49@@ er sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his cra@@ p catch and take care of the next game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ ecks with a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it certainly wasn &apos;t the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian suite were hoping for his N@@ FL debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport was leading to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans , holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss rights of gay rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian tur@@ f with arms control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was condemned to seize his oil company Yu@@ kos and prevented his democratic efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters call for the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn clo@@ ister at Bavarian schools for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get re@@ prehen@@ sions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Parliament faction of the Free Cho@@ irs conven@@ es Friday to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the record number of refugees , now , also dominates the Free vot@@ er meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it was during the Yugoslavia during the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum suits : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need consistent standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more hand@@ ful@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the state policy in Greater Wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a long lasting burner is on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year Kul@@ tus@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Middle @-@ stage plus &quot; at 47 high school students in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ al intermediate level was tested for three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all high school students who want this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free ride at G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long distances , the German stock market has closed business with profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the afternoon was a strong start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology @-@ resili@@ ent Tec@@ D@@ ax rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6,@@ 69 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ St@@ ox@@ x 50 as the code index of the Eurozone decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7,@@ 60 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid profits , too , also bu@@ sted jobs in London and Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets reck@@ on that the markets will be in place until after the interest rate in the US , and also for the big deterioration in the fut@@ ures exchange on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low , and also left deep marks on E@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately deterior@@ ated by 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the D@@ ax tip , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report by the US @-@ investor @-@ magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , investment in future wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; car values were required : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were again set off than in the year @-@ earlier period , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automotive companies Daimler and BMW grew by 1.9 percent , respectively 2,@@ 21 percent respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen &apos;s advantages increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the German pension market , the return on publicly listed federal valu@@ ables fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 People killed , after police shooting rubber floors on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rub@@ bing in a crowd against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , executive district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police took tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber @-@ fired missi@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ war@@ ks used to kill them , but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , obviously produced such a high rate of death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ ese &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mag@@ d@@ ans say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the plot at the Em@@ der Youth Centre Alte Post@@ al is to be built again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the city is preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a mix of trade , commerce and housing planned - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market an area of about 4000 m2 in direct vicinity to the Old Post &apos;s youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , trade and housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; waiting for appropriate offers , is it by the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which investor would come into question , be not yet clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Large road , already purchased just a few months ago and the building can be torn off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , the investor made public plans for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , gro@@ unded , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ esting , medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ der Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the Project Cri@@ tics and the F@@ DP Group , which included investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach said to the offensive : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the project has been around ten to twelve million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent reactions among sea@@ worthy owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the images and new details on the desired hotel construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , mer@@ cen@@ ary owner and member of the board of directors of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must come whole bus loads in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google starts double donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign that will help thousands of refugees who over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of making a manager announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark web and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations offering assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally raised funds up to a value of 5.5 million , goo@@ gle@@ .com / ... could be doubled to 11 million $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven over 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many fled from the Afghanistan war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diab@@ etics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years , following a new study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years obesity has proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ to Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ch@@ asing - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BM@@ I under those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 by the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately immediately at 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dissolved and 28 % in part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was completely reduced to only one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the results were better with the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease inf@@ ant mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and had higher decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people undergoing obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a theme that is currently attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel , &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot record all refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lo@@ oming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader encouraged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which focuses on ethics studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mitt@@ edly admir@@ able , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 11 September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the past 4 years

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants reported in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , of 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some children dis@@ infection agent intentionally drink while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; videos on YouTube show how young people can drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only for a cheap experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; te@@ ens have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash , in order to obtain a harder beverage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very promising for children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sp@@ lashes taken by straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was taken into an emergency room for treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the Medical Center outside of Atlan@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah drew her words , and wasn &apos;t able to go when she arrived in the emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had stum@@ bled across the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ at@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic and disinf@@ ecting agents and to store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teacher is highly allergic to anti@@ sep@@ tic agents , and ban@@ ishes them out of their room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the corrupt plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a collision event on the cross @-@ gap between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ ein , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old mot@@ orists were easily injured in a rear @-@ end collision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver travelled towards the industrial area on the cross track , and it was too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed the vehicle onto a Ford fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident involving vehicles , material damage was caused by around 10,000 euros , the police for@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer travelling and had to be tow@@ ed off .
rum@@ or Kitchen : no D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk of D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , Dei@@ la ad@@ mits that the Ho@@ ops are on a bad place , but that he will turn it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s accus@@ ation and be cau@@ tious in January &apos;s new commitments , which could destroy the unit of the ca@@ vern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ons increase lead over Celtic on five points
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a scar@@ ce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , making the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays a talk about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . it insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control since they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of title competition in Scottish football , bor@@ dering Dutch - de Bo@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
former R@@ angers middle @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic Celtic fans since there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic Games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they talk about both teams , and that is what they are interested in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian Chef s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now at the top of the table with five points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel this , but we must go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious in January transfers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments only a few weeks ago , who pointed out that he hur@@ ried several January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Bos@@ s Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players coming in the summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team is really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with feedback note
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he can withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a ru@@ sty kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years , and has not managed to finish Wales this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hear@@ ts tuned to S@@ FA @-@ Battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field , and then lost 3 : 2 , but the red card of the defender was later rev@@ oked - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and insist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity questioned , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ repaired Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted , to sing a song sung with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts players Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred in a pub in the area Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by and it was the heat of the moment &quot; said the Stür@@ mer and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t go back to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le when it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot;
tann@@ ins Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United Management
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around , but it is clear that the decline in the playing field must end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to be &quot; un@@ lucky against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es is dre@@ aming that his team of Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league win who gave them a margin of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything in poker games or leag@@ ues that have won &apos;t won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above U@@ K@@ s , such as the figures of the National Statistics Office ( ONS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly a year ago , that Scotland has made the historical decision to stay part of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these twelve months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the process
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the security staff could not settle the situation , the staff called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with the use of pepper spray , the officials were able to take the stur@@ geon in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a breath @-@ alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escence was picked up by his mother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 subjects and initially remained in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why I will witness an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the tox@@ in sy@@ ringe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the day approached , I began to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the US , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ ar lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is elected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be chosen , will see it emotion@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will get access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she cleaned up that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present , to write there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the Movement will help the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that there is a strong probability , that he is not guilty of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe , that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe his execution is wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and from that perspective , I will see him dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot claim to be really objective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be other re@@ porters , to which you can turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you will get from me is , what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man after a wet police car chase persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry , when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , trying to sof@@ tly persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ anning V@@ ale , the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale , was called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too keen to make his uniform wet , so he turned into a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben C@@ ous@@ ins , championship football player , offers an unforgettable example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol checks and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ t@@ up@@ pers rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tonight , I will go home and sleep well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , I have to think about what I do with my license . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , Moo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity Department tried to spy on his st@@ ables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I am asked to give - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they obviously believe , that I am a liar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed to touch me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard S@@ undry , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should this bring me to the point of view , that it is personally ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the R@@ V@@ L beha@@ ved cow@@ ard@@ ly and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now pon@@ der them about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frustr@@ ations levels of the trainer have developed over the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching stated that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ slaugh@@ tered master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the Rac@@ ist treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on my leg .
it could have been so last night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been like yesterday the whole day , which was so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it had , however , on the day of the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man behind driver &apos;s cur@@ ses arrested
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a bi@@ cycl@@ ist and ensu@@ ing driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia presented himself to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be charged for driver &apos;s flight and reduced assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , stays in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals because of claims for w@@ rest@@ ling
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critici@@ zed Tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites , the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a very scar@@ ce remark about the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ alo@@ g of his crew , and said she was concentrating only on her &quot; contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team agree with him , as it was concerned that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring@@ fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we did not change anything from our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . however , in the past six weeks we have made our contact at Tac@@ tical a real center of gravity , and this has provided us with the trend revers@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is funny , as this always appears at this time of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a mess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the ball game you want to play , if you have this kind of players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to have to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to the Big Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos , against cow@@ boys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or are breaks , and no points do something exciting ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it is the game boards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they mention us , it means that in one phase we will meet again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team is free at this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the final round in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug booking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man who may face a lifetime punishment because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c 29 was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and stopped in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the J@@ ach@@ port during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a potentially life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer argued that he was trying to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars for safety together to achieve his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the asser@@ tive explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone won &apos;t be enough to stop him from appearing , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass to the police daily and adher@@ es to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab ri@@ ps apart
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , a truck driver was seriously injured in a collision with three trucks on the free@@ way 5 at Karlsruhe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in direction Basel , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape the last moment , as the police cleared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident causing the accident was torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord , the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked until 2 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl in order to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when it was asleep and went into an online mess@@ aging service by which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing , and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed the computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which were used to search for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to be the officials he did since it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction , he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked him to send more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he did it , to enti@@ ce them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was shaking and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone , and faced the accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed , and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the prosecution of in@@ decent pictures of children on June 14 last year , and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
defence lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked for that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders because one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his violation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael dev@@ oured the verdict , until October , to preserve background reports on social work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg was ref@@ und@@ able in this case , but was held in provisional custody for hear@@ ings to other cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the date of the judgment , he was included in the sexual crimes directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are taken off the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for fear of discovery and arrest , many of the bad people were increasingly attracting people at smaller border cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along the river river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the Land@@ kreis Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had reached the German side by foot , over bridges and reser@@ vo@@ irs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there they are received by Federal Police officers , and forwarded to the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Munich Central Station , more refugees arrived in Germany compared to the weekly start on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 8 : 00 am alone , some 700 people were in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stuttgart : er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a deep @-@ print area on Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake District with bows of 60 to 90 mph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass makes it : every two years , the cars show their innovations at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the compact cars are especially popular in the compact cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : approximately 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the brand core .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the new Astra to be sold well , the new Astra is also not to be much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel introduces a gateway to the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer other diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the main competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as five @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second version will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA , even on new compact cars ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault represents the fourth generation of its Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a clearly sporty GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new model , the Nissan publisher wants to find its position in the highly growing segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the design line of the brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe , scheduled for spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n shut down on the front panel : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants on the IAA in the compact class , such as the ris@@ ed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court ruled on an ex @-@ prisoner of the Judi@@ cial System , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suffer@@ ers can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces , only a few days later ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man who according to his lawyer was now on the free foot has moved into a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his arrest due to the un@@ fortunate detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the judges took up the verdict of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ als and returned the case back to the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they see man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ cht now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , a compensation scheme was given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a car@@ ving of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ cht needs to clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they said only in April to a prisoner of compensation , because he was imprisoned in a cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to 2011 , human un@@ worthy decision is also the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Karlsruhe was also confirmed on Wednesday by the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed a decent housing in a parallel event in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three months , the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours per day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons have also entered the head@@ lines for lack of staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prisoners are therefore trapped in 23 hours , increasing aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ra@@ ckets it should have been due to the tense situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ platz , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young lack , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy , &quot; We are making this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what happens in Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to statements by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany will even be able to record a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Economy ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built up so far ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of living space is dramatic above all for affordable rental objects : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments come out of the rental price , and for these particularly favourable resi@@ dences , refugees will also apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is much too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social apartments annually would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Employment Research , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not be questioned about their qualification in order to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the society of admission , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says Mig@@ rational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there was a political turn : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there was a job ban for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to restrict the asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled workers , there is a majority of the visibility that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of German knowledge is one of the major barriers to access to the labour market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , research shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the royal road to labour integration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the borrow@@ ed parents , it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ eck@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more technical schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the countries , students are prepared for classes without German knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but also teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or graduates - the only exception to date was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but abandoned his position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a residence or D@@ ul@@ f do not receive services according to the asylum seekers law , if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter generally do not receive a bil@@ l@@ lion , since they do not fall under the circle of legitimate persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees had to live four years in Germany so far , in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to a period of 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also this gap has to be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should gradually abandon the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches law will further develop into a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ law relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , who professionally takes care of the newcom@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to extract such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is becoming more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany , as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U series showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are calling for a long time , and why international agreements like anti @-@ racism convention must become reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens will use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the expected refugees , Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands compens@@ ating all newcom@@ ers immediately in registering health cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , achievements could be settled by the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to fores@@ ee so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seekers law stipul@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , the doctors especially make the language barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpretation costs would need to be taken over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more il@@ lic@@ ated disabilities , and with young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the partially other diseases , German doctors come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syrians had a highly developed education system , some refugees were even doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be allowed to practice , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill , according to estimates of the Federal psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees are particularly vulnerable , declares Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently published study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ sed in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who suffers from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ falls , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ghtening and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the process usually takes several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in the social offices usually non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide if a therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst influences the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and single entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites to dream in the nests on the brick @-@ v@@ ases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ inary teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current production stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gift for lovers is , therefore , the family in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday mo@@ ckery and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great cocktail with world @-@ city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program of the cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Castill@@ o Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the heroes of silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to loose it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ease and flexibility , they identify with these words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from numerous salmon @-@ salt , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst fascinated with finger @-@ pointed feel and ag@@ ility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
Ser@@ pent Man fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghtened at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little other and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
griev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst has a position too : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not going well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 80 animals from five different continents , enjoy each pet@@ ting unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be picked up by the eyes upon request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the Man@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the highest bid is good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure , and nothing happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little j@@ um@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , there should be something for every visitor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites from September 17 to 20 , daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock to his ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are dis@@ counted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s claims that they had received anonymous death threats , and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , they had posted him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones which they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the party conducted by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will break up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to expand 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support businesses in transition to a new style of business . &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ riv@@ alled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company which was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of the Stan@@ ford University bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP has undergone a massive restructuring , in order to cope with the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb has to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and , as long as his rehabilitation works according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a bone , which did not heal well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in touch with his kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere disease illnesses for his debut , six years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al , 15@@ 7 league players in the last five seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the broader picture of Arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate continues during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need a little break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to move forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with reference to the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by far hope to lead the association to its first European Central Triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out with arsen@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the absence of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an effort to address the problem the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a miserable life ) in 2015 announced the aim of asking the men to seek help when they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course , you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with their emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear powerful , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Beau@@ tiful with Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which was shining through interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football @-@ watching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely relate to completely her feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of telep@@ hon@@ y care explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening roles for people who feel depres@@ sive and self @-@ prone , showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friends is one of the shows that comes to mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total of 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angel Di Maria is celebrating his hits against Malm@@ ö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria helps to pass by PS@@ G , to Malm@@ ö . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way but after that she missed a number of occasions before she finally scored her lead when Cav@@ ani got a head goal in the 6@@ 1st minute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against Swedish master , as it does not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and relaxed back , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury that could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defence before joining Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off beat to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground lined up a heavy opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin &apos;s tips posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes arose , with some mis@@ passes and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ ped alone in the first half , after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c scored a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö had to come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi completed a gate at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
gl@@ en@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion by shares sales
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is headquartered in Switzerland , was hit $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its huge debt settlement plan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in an explanation that it sold new shares valued at approximately € 1.6 billion in order to pay its own debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , struggles with declining commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes demand and ex@@ erts a devastating effect on markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid increase to the top of the London stock exchange on Wednesday morning , on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale last week , as part of the more extensive plans to pay around one @-@ third of its 30 billion dollar debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company sold the new investments to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were 1.3 billion shares valued , up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns about long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president and First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will be hosted by X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have bilateral discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis visit will offer the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese collaboration in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i will give the opportunity to constructive approach areas of opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders on its way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i address a number of controversial questions including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ pion@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Me@@ ers .
440 hp sports@@ car borrow@@ ed and driven to scrap
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to meet a dream and borrow@@ ed a Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the wet highway , the evil awakening came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a company in the county Got@@ ha you can meet the dream , and once again hire a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang Bos@@ s 30@@ 2 with 440 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , this also did a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the county of Got@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt , the dream came out and over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , got on wet roads into the sling and drove into the guard rails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports car suffered grave damage , no one was injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage to property is estimated to be 40,000 EUR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola hin@@ dered the changes to FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times championship winner , four times championship winner , twice European champion , twice European champion , once world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he stood before the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Madrid has won anything , we don &apos;t know , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the registered also of FC Bayern , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminder : in summer 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann assumed the FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not move
but the change did not come about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the decisive man is working for the German record master : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed up Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has got me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter final of the Champions League against the whole distance on the lawn , switched off the red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king class triumph at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matt Dam@@ on confronted the Afgh@@ an film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown , while discussing the diversity and said that she is not needed behind the scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protag@@ onist in the chosen script of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it in the cast of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; guaranteed Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian resist@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on and Brown , the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers joined to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the character of Harmony , Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white cro@@ chet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People chose Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion was broadcast , social media explo@@ ded prior to endor@@ sement of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter @-@ user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tweet earned more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 cases since its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact , racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a nationwide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured halt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince created a recording on the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still weaker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hatred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a group of love , &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Dam@@ on was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , it is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and help minister Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition show , which just ended its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who completed all stages of his obstacle course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last task , climbing was part of a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 by American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster than what made him the winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10.000 $ or had a life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine , how this is ... the future is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think he got any gru@@ dge about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think Isaac felt the same , if they had changed the roles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfect against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad &apos;s mis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held its early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inner@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once again in ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior , and enabled three R@@ uns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to throw every game in the bull@@ pen , and so I want to go into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designed Tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first triple hit , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the hard@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked good at his ( drummer training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh inner , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ dy over@@ flow@@ ed the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designed R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who gave the right @-@ handed turn Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of runners and the end run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ monkey to a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League , the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ monkey suggested a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Detroit , at the end of the ninth interior , added a Insurance Run , Wall managed a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the right @-@ handed th@@ read@@ ed out S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit also benefited from a still non @-@ moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished , &quot; said Mr Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first time , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z brought a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tig@@ ers laid in the second one a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not hit very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever Legal @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter @-@ school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list due to a shoulder lashing , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP will kn@@ itted Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since August 20 , he was missing because of a break@@ up on the right hip joint . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden , Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the participants are then to be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they settled with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be accommodated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse had arrived in H@@ esse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective departure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive deployment of international aid on site for the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austrian Minister of Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV broad@@ caster ORF , Hungary won &apos;t be sent back to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany , too , sent no refugees to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement where Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it had already been discussions with the Director General for Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not mention concrete figures , and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start for binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong Refu@@ gee Cris@@ is in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , announced Merkel on Tuesday evening after almost four hours discussions with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , they also complain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this conception was expressed unanim@@ ously in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , thousands of desperate refugees are stuck on the Balkan route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia in the night , on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie the border to Romania with a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling ev@@ ils from Romania , Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were first det@@ en@@ tions of people , who had cut the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , thousands of more migrants reported on the way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; space probe finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the ice cap of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean s@@ wore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include researchers from si@@ ght@@ ings of the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; spac@@ ecraft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the moon dan@@ gles slightly on its orbit around the ring planet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although this motion is only small but still too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ ew water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least at the south pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ama lacking in 1860 München several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around one month , the 1860 München has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for a month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation gave an induc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis is expected to take four weeks &quot; break @-@ off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a non @-@ professional team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties presented a defensive one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium , and was also under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his conc@@ ussion , the team will return to team training next week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian National Team should embar@@ k on the running training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in a violent collision at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious bre@@ ech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , he is often tempted by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar , especially su@@ cro@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy , the exotic fruits are still healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all contain man@@ goes but much vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so even green man@@ goes can taste delicious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads , such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US package service U@@ PS provides up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company began recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all drivers will be sought .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the parcel services to harsh criticism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first fin @-@ tower and then striking cold front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ ir@@ ord side of the F@@ öhn wind breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland rus@@ hed on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and in the night to th@@ urs@@ day , the F@@ öhn blows partially with strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ouses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the gro@@ oming on Thursday morning , a striking cold front crosses us . the strong rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ print area on the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys in the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result the F@@ öhn blows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ öhn winds its way up to the adjacent center , and even or@@ cs of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in the north on Wednesday , storm dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , moisture starts to accumulate on the slopes of the Alps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is rain , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated in the next 48 hours in the next 48 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn blows the air , as a result a cold front rolls with powerful , partially weather@@ ed ra@@ ins from west to east via Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes up to stor@@ my weather and temperatures rise significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther King
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of town president Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino on Wednesday , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honored as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the Working Group of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in hiding their faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city as a deca@@ ying s@@ inner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to historians , his negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , Luther had introduced the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church with his thes@@ es against the fall in the evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works , which Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cycles emerged that dev@@ ote themes such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or father@@ hood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current relationships today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these texts are , like verbal mirrors by Al@@ ts painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; embedded between the original Bible text of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , he formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows dou@@ bly a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education was done with the cane , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work in order to be able to bear my father &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterised today by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and bl@@ iss to show things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures always have something mysterious , and are not decorative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall down into the images , &quot; let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image seeks its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost took place on Tuesday for the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung that has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst &quot; : &quot; I like how he can live with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old have not taken care not to fully grasp the Bible , but rather to select the most important topics for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation on November 15th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans made , space found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was finished again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured ver@@ dr@@ ing , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so hill cli@@ pped up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will be made in October , the first public coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the child and youth committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the former indoor swimming pool should be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear mark on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is responding to the growing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in dealing with the pending problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle no one can say that I &apos;m not doing anything , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for every individual to get a grip on this subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and would help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crucial turn@@ out must however set the policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Refu@@ gee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; explains K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs make a clear sign when they are printed on the left tri@@ cot instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Pierre Ru@@ di V@@ ö@@ ller of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is going on , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football teams , no , we have to use our jet force , our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim , managing director Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this Friday , the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their places , be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as great , small and smallest clubs are active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and the next year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , the association provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive vice @-@ president loses an eye with accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to several reports , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after midnight on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass worn in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost mur@@ der@@ ous , impot@@ ent , then dragged out onto the street - he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ ven &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we met at the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , &quot; he will be back to Germany in October and continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched a picture and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Singapore on the weekend , he is just as little as a reserv@@ ist for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without ra@@ eus at the foot of Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel , the B@@ V@@ B coach said openly : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its line@@ age at the R@@ eus position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he announced a change at the go@@ al@@ keeper &apos;s position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tribal Roman bür@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all European league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left frank@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a high probability , he will also deny the second game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ebo@@ ding statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the Fin@@ alist train for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , Marco Wei@@ gl considers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ bot Cars : government W@@ ants R@@ ole for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a pioneer in the transformation of the automobile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke to Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the Show IAA from a &quot; new Mobility Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ brin@@ dt said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who will also come together with industry representatives at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid change on digital radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to test new technology , a test track on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government wants to review the legal framework and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Germany wants to use the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to adopt a change in the Vienna Convention , which has previously only envis@@ aged people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated driving increasingly takes charge of the car , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving will be possible on high@@ ways by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; value added in driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 , to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Germans are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Insp@@ ection Organization decre@@ es that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars in the next ten years reck@@ on that 31 per cent do not believe in it at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents reck@@ on by 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could possibly imagine 15 percent in traffic jam 45 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances , under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis European
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current status , the Düsseldorf wants to present only in the individual with the title fight from 25 September to 4 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final decision will be made at the latest on September 22 , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to take the title without Timo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; said Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who introduces the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo also lack@@ ed , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the fifth part of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English football team Luke Sha@@ w , who was born in Manchester United , has injured a serious injury on the right leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the Defender was hit by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old to be an En@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the Bürger@@ stei@@ g to the cat@@ walk ) , which has changed from the 18th of September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is lucky that the fashion designer has changed his leaning toward a show about his person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you die , you get to the museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impressive collection had previously been made in Canada , Montreal and Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibits give an insight into the scar@@ cely percep@@ tible work of man , whose fashion history has written without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed oeu@@ vre that has been used for much effort : to dev@@ ise the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have drawn up 14 tons of material to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l was there : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stands for the first , ag@@ grav@@ ated fashion attempts by the designer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , he taught himself the design of fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I bought them naturally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for his first fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jewelry instead of a curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were produced in large quantities for customers , for example , they worked on ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , fashion is again important again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning times of the imp@@ asse , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , leaning on past styles , is a growing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not use niche in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cooperation with nine other companies , Mo@@ hren@@ wirt P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker@@ eien . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last 15 years , about 80 percent of turnover has been cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; private specialty shops and wholesale are almost no longer available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our products hardly reach the customer on this path .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are made much cheaper in Asia , and are distributed over chains almost exclusively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , exports , up to date to Russia and the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enough reasons for new paths .
the industry association tries to score also through environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein explained : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diploma @-@ designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the machine ticks some small balls at some places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ iz@@ ede@@ at Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ enes tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the issue P@@ lau@@ enes peak - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in por@@ thol@@ es and surroundings and who want to have a souvenir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ enes tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , according to the &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it &apos;s not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magical girl girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the global economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director already says : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XI , ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open wider and wider to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned to steer the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the citizens reporting system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it assign@@ s a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , which ensures a public business environment and is more open to the market , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the company , ensuring that companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the framework of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded enterprises and provide better services for them , &quot; said the Statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and using professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and major leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury threshold in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ors and thus to the consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t says that the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that approximately 50 percent of the catches are not allowed on the basis of the existing limit values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ Watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low that they are already adher@@ ing to the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the reduction in cl@@ ash is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant defl@@ ection maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercury is a heavy metal heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , especially in predat@@ ory fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low amounts can cause particularly in un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his homepage , the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares that a &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants bear more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
