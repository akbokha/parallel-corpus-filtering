&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same procedure is applicable , if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organisation , the Community and the States concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures for entry into this convention are concluded and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) When the community is notified that it is able to apply its security measures regarding this state , for the purpose of this convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) The General Director , immediately noti@@ fies all Member States of the organization from any amendment to this convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on that day , in which the organization of the community and states maintains the written notification that their methods for entry into force are completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) This Convention remains in force for so long , as the states are contracting party of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means agreement and protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine how necessary , when implementing the provisions of part I on securing measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim of the preventive measures outlined in this Convention is the timely detection of significant quantities of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core brit@@ tle bodies for unknown purposes and the deter@@ rence of such degradation by the risk of early detection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enrich the target set in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of basic importance , associated with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important complementary measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical completion of the checks by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone , the quantity of material which is not shown for a given period is specified in accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in carrying out their ex@@ ams , the organization makes full use of the community &apos;s safety system after article 3 full use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounting and control system of the Community for core material , according to this Convention , is based on a breakdown in material balance zones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying its backup measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following types of use and , as far as necessary , see how they are more determined and appropriate in the supplementary agreements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) a measuring system for the determination of quantities of goods received , produced , failed , lost or otherwise from the existing core material and quantities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) the assessment of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements , and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) procedures for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( e ) procedures for assessment of accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F ) a protocol and report system that points to the core material stock for each material balance zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
g ) In@@ struc@@ tions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the securing measures under this Convention do not cover material mining , mining or ore treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ orium @-@ containing material ( which the phase of the nuclear fuel circuit described under the letter c ) has not yet been reached ; the community of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) leaves nuclear material suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase where it is produced , or else in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit produced in the States , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) The provisions provided in this Convention are concluded for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not possible or desirable , the organization and community consult each other on the application of appropriate security measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) The provisions provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and community notice that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the request of the Community , the organisation exemp@@ t the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) Special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such a core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the request of the Community , the organisation exemp@@ t the core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , provided that the total material quantity delivered by this article is no longer considered to be more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by placing its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment that is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ ur@@ an , calculated by balancing his weight with the five fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or less ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the securing measures following this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures will be made on that material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community meets with the organisation of supple@@ mental agreements , which are necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization according to this agreement , in detail how the procedures prescribed in the Convention are applicable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or am@@ ended without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supplementary agreements take place simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the initial report outlined in article 62 , the organization presents a summari@@ zed inventory of the underlying core material contained in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of their review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organization ( Organization ) on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ rans@@ fer@@ al problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) It is the purpose of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this Agreement and the Central Bin@@ dings , to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the organization of the EW@@ G has presented a table from which it is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria set in this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Account Account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which the Member States have to contribute to this Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transaction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; account is separated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the Member State , to pay upon request in the currency of the relevant State by order of the organization as the administrator of the Special F@@ act and to be deposited in the institution in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days after entry into force of this Agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the appointed time ;
II ) The second in the amount of the remaining amount was agreed on 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) Every member state can , upon request , make payments before the above dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker proposes approximately proportional dra@@ fts to the cash or the school @-@ notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional capacity of credit to loan terms and conditions , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VII ) to the extent , in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each special transaction loan is intended to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral advance ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization funded by the organization , which is to be considered under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the means of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions that apply to the development loans granted for the organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in 50 years each . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special loans are granted in one or more currencies by member states and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; payments to the payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization , which reserves them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each special action loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the bene@@ fici@@ ary and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recei@@ pts from any special transaction loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient or for goods or services ( ii ) in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and according to what the manager has appointed at the time of the loan granted to the recipient of a special transaction loan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until complete awar@@ ding of all special transaction loans , the supervis@@ or teaches the E@@ EC on the projects and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the time of the withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the ste@@ ward receives the EW@@ G quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditure for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrator transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year of the organization , with a statement by the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EW@@ G will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the F@@ TT as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrator creates and performs suitable records and accounts from which the contributions to the accounts recei@@ vable account , which are paid to the account and the amount deposited on the account , and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the administrators work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until full issue of the special transaction account provides an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement will not be entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organization may agree upon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the total capital amount of all the special transaction loans received by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governments of the Member States notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications , along with a notification of the regular approval of the agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , following the day of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is in two sentences in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . each word is legally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas the agreement in the form of an envelope to am@@ end the An@@ nex A of the Protocol no . 1 , the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is issued : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as Switzerland , represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation are referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ET &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion still extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary overl@@ app@@ ings and to speed up their respective research projects which have attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement should enable each contracting party to draw the greatest possible benefit by merging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and consequently the shared goal of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes in An@@ nex I and II , called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation within the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or am@@ ended by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each time the parties are accepting a new program , this is the place of the programme or the programmes listed in An@@ nex I and II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association , intended in paragraph 1 , is realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories carried out at the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of each programme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , following &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; concluded with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the timing of the current agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the affiliated institutions , called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is one of J@@ ET &apos;s Common Market at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose purpose falls within the framework of the present agreement , excluding association contracts or other similar treaties concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organs , which are contracted to carry out the association provided in Article 2 , 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and the Association Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association agreement , in particular , considers the suspension of a steering committee , the relevant representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to supervis@@ e the development of research work and to steer clear , that best results are achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ations in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme , called &quot; VG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the current or planned programmes and activities within the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it promotes collaboration and coordination between the affiliates and is targeting their mutual objective in the interest of both contracting parties and the joint target defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG shall appoint one or several Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the groups of consultants , which provide the VG research proposals with regard to the possible scientific results approved for the Eur@@ atom programme , perceive this task with regard to all research and development work related to this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee of Directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and is responsible for the optimal use of the procedures carried out within the programme , will result in this task with regard to all research and development work carried out under the present agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is particularly responsible for the best possible use of personnel and for sharing the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all co @-@ ordination committees established within the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordination committees , which provide the Committee of Directors with appropriate proposals for the best possible use of resources , personnel as well as knowledge and skills that the laboratories involved in carrying out the Eur@@ atom Programme are taking notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BA@@ F is a member of every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and each associate member state responsible for the core and energy research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the request of the Commission , the Commission consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions and the preparation of future programs and the definition of their overall scope , co @-@ ordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opinions of the District Apostle Meeting , the Administr@@ ative Committee , the Advisory Groups , and the Co@@ ordination Commit@@ tees have deliber@@ ative character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the VG opinion on the urgent actions is compulsory , and the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the two contracting parties work on the works of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purposes of the present agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion is estimated at the Eur@@ atom programme to the total GDP of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the joint venture as soon as it is established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , Switzerland over@@ sees J@@ ET to the Common Market , which is defined in accordance with the provisions of the statutes of this common entity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contribution of the Eur@@ atom to finance the work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used for the calculation of Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out by the relevant treaties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount will be allocated to cover expenditure within the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Council will pay the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 , 15 January and 5 / 12 before 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , the provisions on the access to the knowledge contained in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement are governed by the association agreement and in the agreement on the personal exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provisions on access to the knowledge that apply to Switzerland &apos;s participation in the Common Company J@@ ET are governed in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ utes of the Common Market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right of any contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential component of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the knowledge gained during the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the member states of Eur@@ atom and the associated third state research or production activities that justify access to this knowledge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracting parties share this knowledge of other states , individuals or companies only if there is an agreement between the parties , unless these individuals or companies in Switzerland operate research or production activities that justify access to this knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contracting party of the opinion that the other contracting party has not realized an obligation within the framework of this agreement , it is in@@ compatible with the release of Eur@@ atom Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Joint Committee of Eur@@ atom / Switzerland may issue recommendations based on the opinion of the VG recommendations , which are to be communicated to the relevant authorities of Eur@@ atom countries and Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each contracting party bears the costs of its own member in the arbit@@ ral proceedings , and the costs of the pres@@ idency and the other costs are paid to equal parts of both contracting parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes into force , when the parties have communicated to each other that the necessary procedures have been carried out for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is concluded for the duration of the Eur@@ atom programme referred to in Article 1 , and is renewed in line with other Eur@@ atom programme sequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extension for the duration of the new programme , which comes to the place of the Eur@@ atom programme , is valid in App@@ endi@@ x I . this agreement shall not be concluded if it comes to delays in adop@@ ting another Eur@@ atom programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before each decision on the adoption of a new Eur@@ atom programme , the parties are consul@@ ted within the articles of the present agreement in articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of an exchange of letters to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to simplify the procedure for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the case of renewed amendments to the tariff tariff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it also appears that an article 12 may be included in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to you to confirm the consent of the Community for these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to thank you , if you would like to confirm your government &apos;s approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I invite you to confirm the receipt of your letter today , with the following wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your Government to the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of EU member states within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial condition
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit cards with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks provide a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement could be concluded by the total amount of payments paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery copies of member countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , already here are some conditions called for which the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with each stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the opening of the loans and for any extension , the BC@@ Z would calculate a credit opening fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made before the end of a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the currencies would take place in the currencies available at the BC@@ CI upon completion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that were to be dealt with in consideration of the means of the Bank , presumably three or six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the B@@ IS applies at the respective time in under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely comply with the market rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the B@@ IS has to obtain the necessary funds on the market , then the interest rate coming to the application could achieve a maximum , corresponding to a corresponding margin hei@@ gh@@ tened Li@@ bor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me about the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit cards with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to inform me about the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to you to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that Article 27 of the Convention concerning changes has not yet entered into force , I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 . agree to aboli@@ sh the provisions of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 . recognize that some developing countries have expressed concern that in carrying out Article 1 of the Convention , problems may arise as far as it relates to single representatives or single @-@ group imports into their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties agree that in the case of occurrence of such problems in developing countries , applying the Convention , the application of these countries will be conducted in order to find suitable solutions ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is up to the signing of the Convention on the implementation of Article VII of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement , as well as other governments contributing to this Convention according to Article 22 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic , on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - fresh or ch@@ illed h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure a fau@@ lt@@ less operation of the agreement , Argentina obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the actual annual volume does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the usual supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under the number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community claims the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the common market is not affected by this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products written by this agreement , to a height of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em must be limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with every new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import duties for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , which will take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ stone of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under the number 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total quantity referred to number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23 000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ asses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to prevent market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb fl@@ esh@@ ly on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks on frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the regulation of the extra@@ dition of Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for ex@@ portation of sheep and lambs are only at prices and conditions which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these terms can be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , particularly by awar@@ ding quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products mentioned under the number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community itself comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issuing of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export license issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way , that it is possible to wai@@ ve the status of a deposit for the issuing of the goods in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the execution regulations , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority shall inform the competent authority of the community at regular intervals , for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed in accordance with the country of origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall ensure that the agreement will be properly applied , and it works smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the market conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified under number 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement is not impaired by products made of H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb and goat meat under the agreement not named after the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall discuss all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement , and recommends appropriate solutions to competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall be covered by the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the annual volume , which is set under number 2 , applies to the period from 1 January to 31 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount paid by this agreement to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount , and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing within one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 in view of changes made by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to inform you of your Government &apos;s approval .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I invite you to confirm the input of your letter today , using the following wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure a fau@@ lt@@ less operation of the agreement , Argentina obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the actual annual volume does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with the traditional forms of supply ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products written by this agreement , to a height of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em must be limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with every new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import duties for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , which will take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ stone of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under the number 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to inform your government about this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to you to share with you the approval of my government with the content of your writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recognizing the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are exist@@ ential after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy and that the normal he@@ el of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb is not com@@ promised on these markets I honour the following agreement :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or ch@@ illed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this agreement New Zealand is guaranteed for H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat meat for access to the market of the Community in the amount determined in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Zealand receives assurance that the normal he@@ el of its hammer and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the actual annual volume does not exceed the set quantity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantities stated above are carried out in the traditional forms of supply ( frozen , cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand will not be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments , or maintaining its competitive position in the community market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two contracting parties should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the clause mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community claims the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand resulting from this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products recorded by this agreement , to a height of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em must be limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accession of new member states , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the amounts assigned in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ feed charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this case , the clause 5 above will be taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount stated in clause 2 will be fixed with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community of 2,@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ asses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to prevent market development that could imp@@ air the normal he@@ el of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb fl@@ esh@@ ly on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks on frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the conduct of the regulation of this objective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything in order to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ hausen in the community without risk of market stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community accepts that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for ex@@ portation of sheep and lamb are only at prices and conditions which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Zealand guarantees the observ@@ ance of the amounts specified in clause 2 , in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community itself comm@@ its itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issuing of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is based on the submission of an export license , which is given by the competent authority named by the New Zealand government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way , that it is possible to wai@@ ve the status of a deposit for the issuing of the goods in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the execution provisions , it is also stipul@@ ated that in regular intervals , the competent New Zealand authority assign@@ s the amounts for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed in accordance with the country of origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee is concerned that the agreement will be properly applied and work smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat market of both contracting parties and the market conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified for the purpose specified in clause 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement is not impaired by products made of H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb and goat meat under the agreement not named after the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall discuss all the questions arising in the implementation of the agreement which shall be submitted to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall be without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount determined in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount which is valid from the entry into force of this year is set in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the main area of New Zealand on the other hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ad@@ ore myself if your government can agree to the above , that this letter and your response together form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand into the community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantities stated above are carried out in the traditional forms of supply ( frozen , cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand will not be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments , or maintaining its competitive position in the community market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two contracting parties should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the clause mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community accepts that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for ex@@ portation of sheep and lamb are only at prices and conditions which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat market of both contracting parties and the market conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified for the purpose specified in clause 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to propose that if your government can agree to the above , this letter and your response letter together will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to you to tell you that my government can agree to the above , and that your letter and the response letter together form an agreement according to your proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Austria , Uruguay on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the establishment of rules on import of H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb and goat meat from Uruguay in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensuring that the actual annual volume does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with the traditional forms of supply ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under the number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community claims the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the alle@@ gi@@ ance of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an accounts recei@@ vable by this agreement will not be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the remainder of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of the products written by this agreement , to a height of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em must be limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount determined under number 2 in accordance with the amount of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ic trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import duties for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , which will take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ stone of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under the number 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount , referred to number 2 , is set at the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ asses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb fl@@ esh@@ ly on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks on frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the regulation of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ic she@@ ep@@ skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for ex@@ portation of sheep and lambs are only at prices and conditions which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these terms can be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , particularly by awar@@ ding quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products mentioned under the number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community itself comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issuing of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the implementation provisions , it is also stipul@@ ated that the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority in the responsible position of the community in regular intervals shares the amounts given for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed in accordance with the country of origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowing the fact that the contribution of the UN environmental programme is only done by the end of 1984 , and this contribution as well as voluntary contributions of governments must not fully cover the cost of application of the MEP &apos;s work plan to ensure long @-@ term financing in 1984 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to add the equipment required for in@@ fusion , as well as the solvents for dry preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human whole blood is taken from a healthy person , and blood is missing with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) the diseases that are not free from blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood flow is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ ded through a closed , sterile tube system into a sterile bottle in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution has been inj@@ ected before steri@@ lisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after termination of the blood withdrawal , the bottle is to be closed immediately and to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . thereafter , it may be re@@ opened immediately prior to using the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of quantity , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution should not be more than 220 ml per litre of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration may not drop 97 g per litre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system must first be determined by the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or &apos;s material .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood type determination in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use when specific investigations have sur@@ rendered the non @-@ existence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du , and E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood , which has been replaced after the Convention , shall only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is protected in sterile , closed bottle from micro@@ organisms and lasts until it is used at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures may not exceed 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood is to cool again at 4 to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human thorou@@ gh@@ blood , from which the most part of the plasma has been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been obtained ; other blood cells can be present or can be partially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic drainage solution , which was added after removal of the plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the overall volume of the product , but if a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is to be indicated on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all processes required for manufacturing must be performed under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the sealing must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and only by pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , its volume and composition must also be stated on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by drying the liquid , which is deposited at the top by centri@@ fu@@ gi@@ zation or sedi@@ mentation of human solid material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry plasma is obtained by cal@@ drying or any other method , by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drying product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water that corresponds to the amount of liquid , from which one went out when producing the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protein concentration of the so obtained solution must not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not exhibit visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations , in which ( using a fresh sample ) have been found to be a dangerous percentage of I@@ ce@@ ha@@ sin or immune ha@@ em@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine , are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours of the blood sample , the steri@@ lity of each unit must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to eradic@@ ate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations which show signs of bacterial contamination are not used ; the steri@@ lity of every donation must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission of is@@ os@@ cul@@ ation@@ sh@@ uts , mixtures containing no more than 12 donations are to be used or other methods which are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the liquid levels , from which one went out in the production of the plasma , must be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid produced from it ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) If one uses 1 ml solution a sufficient quantity of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , co@@ ag@@ ulation occurs ; the process can be accelerated in the gross furnace at 37 ° . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24@@ h@@ ly drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine dioxide under pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm of mercury , loss of weight over 0.5 % may not occur in human dry plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry plasma is stored in a sterile , closed bottle in a sterile , closed bottle under the exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and after the possibility of any moisture ; it must be protected from light and at a temperature below 20 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions of human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component consisting of about 60 % of the total protein &apos;s total protein mass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether the final product should be fluid or dry , the preparation must be heated up to 60 C ± 0.5 C after the addition of a suitable stabili@@ zer in the final container . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparations out of human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the present proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

solutions from human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions of human plasma proteins must be stored in sterile and sealed containers by excluding micro@@ organisms . they are protected from light and keep at a temperature of 4 to 6 C .
the label on the container contains all information registered on the corresponding socket ( plant 4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is a preparation made of plasma proteins , which is made from human , the antibodies of normal adult hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method applied must ensure that the final product is tran@@ sm@@ uted the conditions described below , and does not transmit any ino@@ cul@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the production method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the output product must be concentrated in sufficient quantity in the final product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method is satisfactory for each final preparations in this regard , if in the starting and final product , antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in are ti@@ aled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during production , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacter@@ i@@ ost@@ atic substance can be added ; to ensure the bacterial steri@@ lity and the stability of the final product , an appropriate preserv@@ ative and a suitable stabili@@ sing agent can be added to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final product is delivered as a solution , whose immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ in@@ concentration must be between 100 and 170 g per litre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) Electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis , shown by free floating particles under acceptable and appropriate conditions , must show that at least 90 % of the protein contents have the flexibility of the glob@@ ul@@ ins of the normal human plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final solution should not have any visible signs of precip@@ itation or clou@@ ding after a 7 day heating up to 37 ° . furthermore , it is advisable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tests using the centri@@ fu@@ ge method in the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge , in order to determine in which mass the product dis@@ integrates with a lower molecular weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pH value of the final solution must be dil@@ uted to a protein concentration of 10 g per litre with a solution containing 0.@@ 15 ml of potassium chlori@@ de per litre at a measuring temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0.@@ 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution from human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is to be stored in sterile , closed containers under exclusion of micro@@ organisms ; it must be protected from light and at a temperature of 4 to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further specific human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins can be produced ; if an international standard exists , they must be checked according to this standard and their efficiency is indicated in International units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
human anti @-@ small@@ po@@ x immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin has at least 500 international units of small@@ po@@ x antibodies per ml which are determined by a neutr@@ alisation test on ch@@ ori@@ o @-@ all@@ an@@ to@@ i@@ der membrane or tissue culture .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , the specific human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins have the conditions envis@@ aged in section 4 &quot; Nor@@ mal Human Immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the antibody content , the immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ in@@ konzentr@@ ation in the final solution fluctu@@ ates between 100 and 170 g per litre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the label must indicate the efficiency in international units according to the corresponding international standard or reference preparation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry fi@@ br@@ ella is a dry supplement from the soluble part of the fluid human plasma , which is transformed by th@@ rom@@ mb@@ ine into fi@@ br@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applied manufacturing method must ensure that the final product is impregn@@ ated by the conditions described below , and the danger of a transfer of the ino@@ cul@@ ation sh@@ uts is limited to a minimum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is placed in a solution of human fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gens of the same concentration as fresh normal plasma , the cl@@ ot@@ ting must occur outside of the double time required for the cl@@ ot@@ ting of normal fresh plasma with th@@ rom@@ bin@@ additive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24@@ h@@ ly drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine oxide under a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm of mercury , weight loss above 0.5 % may not occur in the preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recovery , the final product must prove to be sterile after testing a suitable bacter@@ i@@ ological method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gen is stored in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in sterile , closed containers with exclusion of micro@@ organisms and on the possibility of moisture ; it must be protected from light and at the recommended temperature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I. The don@@ ors must be healthy and , in particular , free from communic@@ able diseases according to the criteria for human dry plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cold precip@@ itation in the plastic bag , the product may not contain any existing organic solvents or other external substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through such products , penetration of the walls of the plastic bag through such products can be prevented from putting the bag into a second imper@@ me@@ able bag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk of tear@@ ing the plastic bag during storage in frozen condition can be reduced , so that each bag is stored in a protective box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood should be so centered , that its formed components will be removed as soon as possible after extraction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the addition of the given quantity of a suitable solution , the complete dissolution of the dry product must be eff@@ ected in less than 30 minutes at 37 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in keeping with 20 C , the preparation may not have any precip@@ itation within three hours after the dissolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recovered preparation is intended to contain the specified minimum quantity by factor VI@@ II , whereby one unit of the effectiveness of 1 ml is equivalent to average normal fresh plasma ; effectiveness is determined by a method approved by the competent national authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absence of presence regul@@ ates Anti@@ bodies and , if the preparation for patients of an AB @-@ 0 @-@ Group is determined , a ti@@ ter of anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B antibodies at most 1 : 32 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24@@ h@@ ly drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de under pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm of mercury , weight loss of 1.5 % may not occur in the dry @-@ dried preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human factor VI@@ II is stored in a frozen state at a temperature below -@@ 30 C , and in freeze @-@ dried condition under 5 C and protected from light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tro@@ k@@ screw prepar@@ at is stored in an atmosphere of nitrogen or in an air @-@ empty space in a sterile , closed glass bottle under the exclusion of micro@@ organisms and by means of moisture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparation may no longer be stored for longer than a year in the frozen state , in the dried state , unless the required minimum effectiveness has been tested again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the label on the preparation contains all information registered on the corresponding sample , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the don@@ ors must be healthy and , in particular , free from communic@@ able diseases according to the criteria for human dry plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final product tested using suitable methods must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ rogen and free of unwanted vas@@ o@@ de@@ pressed or respiratory effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the rec@@ al@@ fication time of a normal plasma may not be less than 40 seconds when measuring 37 C in presence of a same amount of different solutions of the restored product .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recovered product , which is attached to the same quantity of fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gen ( 3 g / l ) , must not be gut@@ ted within six hours at 37 ° . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recovered preparation must contain the specified minimum quantity by factor IX , whereby one unit of the effectiveness of 1 ml corresponds to normal fresh plasma ; effectiveness is determined by a method approved by the competent national authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24@@ h@@ ly drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine oxide under pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm of mercury , weight loss of over 1.5 % may not occur in the product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when looking at a layer thickness of 5 cm , the extract must be clear and colour@@ less in comparison to the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parties of the European Convention of 15 December 1958 on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin are ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Convention &quot; ) -
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , which &quot; the Parties shall meet all necessary measures &quot; to release the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this deliver@@ ance falls into the jurisdiction of the Community , which has been established following the contract by which it has been established , which has required powers to do so ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas under Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , it is necessary that the European Economic Community can become a contracting party of the convention - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Convention enters into force for the community on the first day of the month , which follows the signing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it enters into force on the first day of the month , following the day the last of the parties has deposited their certificate of acceptance by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) This Ad@@ ditional Protocol , however , comes into force after two years after the date it was adopted , unless one of the contracting parties has notified a objection against its entry into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the convention without becoming a contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary General of the Council of Europe notified the Member States of the Council of Europe , the States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection within the meaning of Article 2 and the time of the entry into force of this Ad@@ ditional Protocol according to Article 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General has also notified the European Economic Community every action , notification or communication related to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that it is most desirable if Member States support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood type determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas this mutual support is only possible if the condition and use of these re@@ agents for blood type determination are submitted together by the Member States , and the necessary facili@@ tation and exceptions are provided for their import . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this convention , the expression &quot; re@@ agents of blood type determination &quot; re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood type determination and determination of blood in@@ compatibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each contracting party may limit the use of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin in the signing of this agreement , or in the laying of its rati@@ fication , appro@@ vals or accession documents to the blood group definition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties agree to re@@ agents to determine the costs of their extraction , preparation , and promotion and , if necessary , the purchase price to other contracting parties , if they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood type determination are provided only under the condition , so that no profit is linked to the fact that they are only used for medical purposes and may be supplied only to those designated by the governments involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every shipment of re@@ agents for blood type determination shall be accompanied by a certificate , that it has been established in accordance with the rules of the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protocol and its installation constitute an administrative agreement , which can be altered or complemented by the governments of the contracting parties of the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracting parties meet all necessary measures to deliver the re@@ agents made available to them from other contracting parties , in order to determine blood type determination of all input taxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances quickly reach the receivers described in Article 3 , and in the shortest possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties submit to each other on the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe a list of places which are authorised for the exhibition of the documents provided in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical with articles designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Convention lays down for the members of the Council of Europe for signing ; they can be contracting party ( by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Convention enters into force one month after the day , at which three members of the Council have signed it under Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval or have rati@@ fied or approved it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each member that has signed or endor@@ sed this Agreement without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , it enters into force one month after signing or pending the rati@@ fication or approval certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement entered into force , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the Advisory States a ) the timing of the entry into force of this convention and the names of the members who have signed it without reservation or have rati@@ fied or approved it ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement , subject to a period of one year , by ad@@ mitt@@ ance to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination has to react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be measured , the ti@@ ter is measured against double in a suitable medium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest di@@ lution di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely in the volume of the flow of blood cells in the total volume .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Health Organization has established International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents , and re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to definition , an international standard prepared contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter gives di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture inside a series , where a micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood type determination , for which the International standard preparations are available ( Anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the International Standard prepar@@ ate or a state standards preparation in International units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren then contain 256 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparations are available free of charge by the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following table shows an example of a similar rating of the International standard ser Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the feasibility trials , which is approved by the state supervisory authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , namely in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is sealed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying about phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent continues to result in specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sera human origin for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml fluid , or re@@ dissolved serum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents , regardless of whether in liquid form or after recovery , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or visible particles or visible particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ agents intended for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ ficially coloured as possible , at least as long as the international agreement reached a uniform system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such quantities , that the re@@ agent inside a container is not only sufficient for conducting tests with the unknown blood cells , but also for conducting tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount inside a container must be so large that , if necessary , the content may be used to perform the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents , in order to determine blood group definition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents have to be stored for a long time from the laboratory , which can be assumed with some probability that the batch is no longer used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents used for blood type determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective means to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to their effective response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents contain no matter of human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on each individual container is a black and white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ activation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ activation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention , each consi@@ gn@@ ment must be enclosed in accordance with the system for this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of selected individuals of the B group , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain A @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparative par@@ ate separately against floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the effectiveness of the serum should not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it is not glut@@ eal any human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparative advantage against a glu@@ ing of B @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be performed within the dual time , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group 0 who can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain ag@@ glut@@ inus A and / or B ; i.e. those of group A including sub groups A1 and A2 of group B and group AB including sub groups A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain ag@@ glut@@ inus A or B ; i.e. those of the group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inate by anti @-@ A serum from group B blood don@@ ors ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparative preparation , separated against floods of A1 and A2 blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparative advantage against a glu@@ ing of B @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the effectiveness of the serum should not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum also has to generate an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x group ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of A1 and A2 blood cells which is required if the same tests with the re@@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity must be performed .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells which is required if the same experiment with the re@@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of similar avi@@ dity is performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with the same amount of 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ R@@ h Blood group sera of any specific@@ ity can belong to one of two types , which are distinguished by the conditions under which ag@@ glut@@ ination is achieved hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with others referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef , or by using other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; incomplete &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are scre@@ ened in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a for determining the R@@ h Group may be subject to change if International standard preparations are available ( i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepared for the anti @-@ Rh@@ o serum or a corresponding comparative advantage over C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells that contain do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a which are intended for use of object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ ino@@ gen C of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with floods of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , these Ser@@ a are specific for the C an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9 percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ti@@ ter of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen e of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sera speci@@ f@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and speci@@ f@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be extracted directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons , or can be produced by mixing Anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time of all kinds of red blood cells that show a reaction should not be less than with the proportion@@ ate antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ ine does not contain any human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparative preparation , separated with flus@@ hing of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it is glut@@ eal no human red blood cells that do not contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparative pre@@ par@@ ate , with a glu@@ ing of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be performed within the dual time required , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin serum for use in the blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extracted from the blood of animals , which are immun@@ ised by injec@@ ting human ser@@ um@@ proteins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s instructions , so ag@@ glut@@ eal not any un@@ loaded human red blood cells , regardless of which blood group they belong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an anti @-@ human @-@ glob@@ ulin serum should cause a strong ag@@ glut@@ ination of the red blood cells in the supplied form or in the di@@ lution indicated on the label if the nar@@ ration with D @-@ positive blood cells is performed after the &quot; alb@@ um@@ in @-@ Re@@ placement &quot; method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same di@@ lution , it has to ag@@ glut@@ inate the K @-@ positive human red blood cells that are particularly sensitive to the weak anti @-@ F@@ ya antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same or another di@@ lution indicated on the label , human red blood cells must also ag@@ glut@@ inate which are sensi@@ ti@@ sed in the presence of fresh human serum with weak complement @-@ binding in@@ complete anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for clinical use , loading with all types of antibody @-@ related antibodies should be det@@ ectable with a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human @-@ glob@@ ulin serum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is extracted by extraction from the seed or other parts of a suitable plant , and possibly subsequent cleaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti @-@ A re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ ine does not contain any human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. , those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A re@@ agent is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparative preparation , separated against floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the efficacy of the re@@ agent must not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ A re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells which is required if the same experiment with the re@@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group re@@ agent ( ii ) anti @-@ B blood group re@@ agent ( veget@@ al )

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Anti @-@ B re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be performed within the dual time required , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) The International standard preparation is of human origin ; if necessary , the appropriate settlement may be human or non @-@ human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parties of the European Convention on May 14 , 1962 , on the exchange of re@@ agents for blood type determination ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Convention &quot; ) - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , which &quot; the Parties shall meet all necessary measures &quot; to release the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this deliver@@ ance falls into the jurisdiction of the Community , which has been established following the contract by which it has been established , which has required powers to do so ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the convention without becoming a contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary General of the Council of Europe notified the Member States of the Council of Europe , the States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection within the meaning of Article 2 and the time of the entry into force of this Ad@@ ditional Protocol according to Article 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adopted by the Ministers of the EF@@ TA Countries and the Member States of the Community as well as the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , which includes a call to create a European Economic Area , particularly with regard to simpli@@ fying boundary conditions and country of origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 1 January 1988 , the Community decided to introduce uniform management documents to strengthen the internal market in order to strengthen the internal market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in DER A@@ weighing that it is appropriate to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , and between the individual EF@@ TA countries , especially by the introduction of a single administrative ap@@ t. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recognizing that this agreement should not be interpreted in detail , that the contracting parties are excluded from their obligations arising from other international agreements - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this convention , measures are stipul@@ ated to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , and in particular a uniform administration paper ( herein@@ after referred to as binding paper ) for all export and import processes ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the terms associated with the transport of goods between the contracting parties are impregn@@ ated using a form of uni@@ formity , to be used in the App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the case , the paper paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping method or import . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to carry out legal provisions in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the single document ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to be demanded by the participants , so that they may come to an application in the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , even using data processing , in view of further facili@@ tation for those involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned shall not be submitted to a customs office and the application for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the filing of an incomplete application can be approved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these cases , a registration in which it can act with the approval of the relevant authorities for a periodi@@ c collective registration must be submitted within the deadline stated by the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use instead of a single api@@ ece trading paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the legal paper is used , the parties may join together with the approval of the relevant authorities in order to provide all relevant schedules , instead of the supplementary sheets to the Federal Office on Trade , in which the goods are described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - mutually exclusive agreements or agreements with regard to a further simpli@@ fication of the activities for their entire goods traffic , or for sub @-@ areas ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - for consi@@ gn@@ ments , which include several types of goods , to facilitate the compliance of the charges in the shipping method Lad@@ eli@@ sten , instead of the supplementary sheets to the form paper ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - allow applications to be issued by public or private data processing plants , if necessary , according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
